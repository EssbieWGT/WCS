A Republican reconciliation bill still being negotiated in the U.S. House contains various proposed changes to Medicaid — among them work reporting requirements — to pay for an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimate found over 8 million people nationally could lose coverage under the House legislation.
The work requirements would apply to adults on Medicaid between ages 19 and 64, requiring them to report at least 80 hours of work per month or qualify for an exception. The exemptions include people with disabilities, caregivers and pregnant participants.
A report from the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation published last month found between 84,000 and 96,000 Missourians ages 19 to 64 could lose coverage under the plan. Another report, from the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities published last week, estimated a reduction of 91,000 Missourians. 
The CBPP analysis found that although 28% of Missouri Medicaid participants in the adult-expansion group could lose coverage, only 8% of participants in the adult-expansion group didn’t work in the last year and don’t qualify for an exemption — meaning thousands of eligible participants would lose coverage.
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

Work requirements in the current version of the legislation would go into effect in 2029, though there are reports Republicans are considering moving up the timeline.
States would be required to monitor compliance and ensure those with exceptions don’t get kicked off. Participants would need to navigate red tape to prove they’re working or exempt. 
New bureaucratic hurdles could prove especially problematic in Missouri, which has historically fared poorly with administration of its public assistance programs. Missouri’s social services agency has struggled to meet federal standards for processing Medicaid applications and is being sued for its administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Administrative issues — such as long call center wait times, application delays and paperwork issues — routinely cause Missourians who are eligible for benefits to be incorrectly booted from benefit programs.
At a legislative hearing for a proposed work requirement in Missouri earlier this year, opponents said work requirements on Medicaid would only exacerbate the social service agency’s call center wait times and staffing issues.
One in five Missourians is enrolled on Medicaid. Most adults on Medicaid are already working or would qualify for an exception, but work reporting requirements would cause many to fall through the cracks, experts say, including low-wage workers with unpredictable hours. Opponents of work requirements also say Medicaid is a crucial safety net for workers who are laid-off or fired for reasons beyond their control and lose employer-sponsored health care.
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has been a vocal opponent of Medicaid cuts but has said he is supportive of work requirements.
“Listen, if you want to do work requirements, I’m all for that,” he told CNN last week. “I bet every Republican, and I bet most Americans would agree with that.”
Arkansas was the first state to adopt Medicaid work requirements in 2018. Until a court halted the program in 2019, over 18,000 people lost coverage, many of whom didn’t know about exemptions or couldn’t navigate the red tape. Studies found Arkansas’ policy didn’t result in increased employment.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program has been mired in technical issues, ProPublica has reported, and the increased requirements for state employees to verify work status have proven onerous and expensive.
Other proposed Medicaid changes in the U.S. House budget include more frequent eligibility checks, out-of-pocket copays for some enrollees and freezing the tax states levy on providers to help fund the program.

When Gov. Gavin Newsom laid out his revised state budget proposal last week, he emphasized how President Donald Trump and his administration made forecasting California’s economic future even harder. To see that chaotic uncertainty in action, all one needs to look at is the daily investment returns posted by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.
As of Friday morning the nation’s largest public pension fund, CalPERS, has a total market value of $539 billion. But in the days following “Liberation Day,” when Trump first imposed his tariffs on April 2, CalPERS losses hovered around $25 billion. In the first two days alone, CalPERS lost $15 billion, while the stock market experienced a $6.6 trillion wipeout.
The pension fund’s bounceback from a $508 billion-low on April 7 could be attributed to Trump easing off his most severe tariffs and making a deal with China to pause the highest tariffs for 90 days. 
But more volatility is likely on the horizon: In an April board meeting, CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost said the agency is keeping its “eyes on the road ahead as we navigate all the twists and turns of the current time.”

Frost: “Global economies expand or contract for a variety of reasons. But we must prepare for the possibility that current events here in the U.S. could have a serious impact on our investment returns as of June 30 and into the fiscal year that begins after that.”

Meanwhile, Newsom described Trump’s tariff rollout as “remarkably inconsistent,” and to plug California’s $12 billion budget hole, the governor is proposing controversial shifts in funding that are drawing ire from advocates and stakeholders:

Health care: Newsom wants to use $1.6 billion from Proposition 35 — which voters approved in November to increase the pay of doctors who treat Medi-Cal patients — toward the deficit. He also wants to move $500 million initially earmarked to support family planning and women’s health care to the state’s general fund. Both proposals are getting pushback from doctors, hospitals and clinics, which argue that it is wrong to reroute money voters set aside for specific health costs. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.


Climate projects: In addition to extending California’s cap and trade program through 2045, Newsom wants to commit more than half of the money it generates this year, or roughly $4.8 billion, to Cal Fire operations and the High-Speed Rail Project. The cap and trade program has provided billions of dollars for projects aimed at combating climate change. Critics of Newsom’s proposal say moving the money would mean limiting resources for the state’s other environmental efforts, such as reducing emissions from gas-powered cars. Read more from CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.

On Saturday the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office released its review of the governor’s updated state budget plan. Though it projects a $14 billion deficit, the analyst’s office considers Newsom’s “spending reductions appropriate.”

What can high school grads wear?

Two months ago, the Trump administration said it would withhold federal funding to school districts that promote diversity, equity and inclusion through clubs, activities and graduation ceremonies. Though a judge has since temporarily blocked that order and California is filing a separate lawsuit to stop the order, one state lawmaker wants to make it easier for students to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, a bill by Democratic Assemblymember James Ramos of San Bernardino would eliminate the pre-approval process for students who want to wear cultural regalia — Native American or otherwise — at graduation. Native students, families and tribes say schools require notice too far in advance because students often receive their regalia on graduation day, sometimes as a gift from a grandparent or tribal elder. This can be stressful for students on graduation day, since they’re unsure whether they’ll be allowed to wear the regalia.
Jennie Rocha, who graduated from Clovis North High School last year, said she was nervous arriving at graduation because she wore a Comanche stole that the school had initially denied.

Rocha: “I wanted to wear it because I feel like everything I have is because of the Comanche. I wouldn’t be able to go to college without their support.”

But schools argue they need a pre-approval process for all students to ensure the regalia are respectful and appropriate.

Public silenced at bill hearings

As state legislators wade through the more than 2,000 bills they introduced this year, residents from across the state who travel to Sacramento to speak in support or opposition of those proposals can sometimes find themselves given just a few seconds to speak or silenced altogether, write CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Hans Poschman.
In the past two months, there have been at least a dozen examples of committee leaders cutting off speakers midway through their remarks, or prohibiting them to talk at all due to time constraints. Legislators say it’s sometimes necessary to ensure hearings don’t drag into the night, while ensuring other members of the public, as well as lobbyists and advocates, get their say too. 
But for Californians who must drive hours from remote parts of the state, it can be frustrating and discouraging to have their viewpoints be rushed through the legislative process. In April, Elizabeth Washoe took a day off work to drive five hours from Modoc County to the state Capitol to speak in support of a bear-hunting bill. She was given only a few seconds to speak.

Washoe: “I would love to have more time to say something. It’s not equitable representation for rural areas.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to extend California’s landmark cap and trade program through 2045. But earmarking half of this year’s funds to the beleaguered rail project and Cal Fire would leave too little for other climate projects, critics say. 


California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to tap at least $2.5 billion from the state’s climate fund to pay for state firefighting crews and the long-troubled high-speed rail project.
In his budget proposal unveiled last week, Newsom announced that he is seeking to extend the state’s landmark cap and trade program, which is funded by credits bought and sold by major polluters, through 2045. But the allocation of the money is already triggering a fervent debate among state lawmakers.
Large polluters, such as oil refineries and power plants, pay for their greenhouse gases through a market system of auctioned credits called cap and trade. Over the past 11 years, almost $13 billion from cap and trade auctions has already been spent on electric vehicles, public transit, clean energy and other projects to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change.
The governor’s new plan would commit $1.54 billion of the 2025-26 climate funds, and more in later years, to pay for Cal Fire’s “fire prevention, fire control, and resource management activities.” That would amount to more than a third of the state fire agency’s $4.47 billion budget, according to the governor’s proposed budget. Wildfires have grown more extreme because of climate change, straining Cal Fire’s resources.
In addition, through 2045, the governor’s plan would earmark at least $1 billion a year of the climate funds to the California high-speed rail project, which aims to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco. The project, which has been beset with construction delays, cost overruns and fights about the route for years, was allocated $407 million of cap and trade money last year.
Combined, the firefighting and high speed rail costs could consume more than half of the projected $4.8 billion that cap and trade would provide in the next fiscal year.
Newsom’s proposal to extend California’s cap-and-trade program, which expires in 2030, for 15 more years could spark one of the year’s most consequential fights in the Legislature over climate change.
The push to extend the program is bound to be contentious, particularly if Newsom seeks a two-thirds vote of the Legislature, as various groups jostle for a slice of the funding. Watchdogs, policy analysts and environmental justice advocates also have raised concerns about how the program is structured and who benefits the most.
Many legislators have already expressed concerns about the use of climate funds to pay for firefighters and high speed rail. Some lawmakers and other critics and analysts say diverting the money would mean cutting other priorities, such as the transition to electric vehicles.
“You’re going to have some tough choices,” said Helen Kerstein, who tracks the cap and trade program for the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. “You can’t add $1.5 billion — and growing — and not take anything away, at least in the near term, given current projections.”
“You’re going to have some tough choices. You can’t add $1.5 billion — and growing — and not take anything away, at least in the near term.”HELEN KERSTEIN, LEGISLATIVE ANALYST’S OFFICE
Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Democrat from Suisun City, said she is concerned that using climate fund money to pay for Cal Fire’s activities could crowd out spending that has already been promised to reduce emissions from cars and trucks and fund mass transit.
Transportation “is the largest single source, but the hardest to decarbonize,” Wilson said. “And the whole point is to transition, which is why those investments (are) necessary.”
A coalition of environmental justice groups said the governor, by using so much money for high speed rail and general fund expenses, is leaving inadequate money “for extreme heat impacts, affordable housing, clean drinking water, and other critical environmental programs that reduce greenhouse gasses and clean up contaminated air, water and soil that pose direct threats to public health.”

The cap and trade proposal came as California faces a $12 billion budget deficit. By proposing the cap and trade extension as an addition to the budget bill, which moves  through the legislative process faster than standalone bills — Newsom could sidestep what might otherwise be a longer, more contentious climate debate.
The move links the reauthorization of the program to broader budget negotiations — boosting the governor’s leverage but reducing legislative oversight and public input.
Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat from Irvine, protested the governor’s moves at a committee meeting on Thursday. 
“This is probably the most challenging budget situation the state of California has faced in at least the last seventeen years. We are going to be grappling with some very, very tough choices, very tough decisions,” she said. “Trying to then layer in, and shoehorn in, the reauthorization of our landmark climate cap and trade — cap and invest — program seems kind of insane to me.”
Newsom’s proposed extension of the program — which he wants to rename “cap and invest” — comes after President Donald Trump attacked it in an executive order targeting blue-state climate initiatives. The order singled out California’s cap and trade program as forcing businesses to meet “radical requirements.”
Newsom framed his cap and trade proposal in the resistance language reminiscent of clashes during the first Trump era. “California won’t bend the knee to a federal administration hellbent on making America polluted again,” Newsom said in a statement.
But some state lawmakers are already questioning key parts of the plan. Assemblymember Steve Bennett, a Democrat from Oxnard, questioned during the hearing Thursday whether revenues from cap and trade could realistically cover all of Newsom’s promises.
“So, in a sense you’re proposing more money than we’re saying we have?” Bennett, chair of the committee, asked Newsom administration officials from the state Department of Finance.
Bennett was also openly skeptical of continuing to use cap and trade money to pay for the high-speed rail project, which has ballooned to a cost of $128 billion. “We need to… make sure we don’t have a train to nowhere,” he said.
Through 2030, 25% of all cap and trade money is earmarked for high speed rail under state law. A bill in the  Assembly authored by a Republican that would eliminate that earmark has not moved forward.
“Real tracks are being laid…so I want to get (high speed rail) done. That’s our commitment. That’s why it’s still reflected in the cap and trade extension.”GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM
Newsom said at his budget briefing Wednesday that his “commitment (to high speed rail) is firm.”
“Real tracks are being laid…so I want to get it done,” Newsom said. “That’s our commitment. That’s why it’s still reflected in the cap and trade extension.”
Several other lawmakers also raised concerns about the governor’s budget math and were skeptical of relying on a funding stream that is supposed to shrink over time as California reduces its carbon emissions.
“Trying to…shoehorn in the reauthorization of our landmark climate cap and trade program (in budget negotiations) seems kind of insane to me.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER COTTIE PETRIE-NORRIS 
California Transit Association Executive Director Michael Pimentel said the governor’s plan was “silent on the importance of continued climate investment” into mass transit.
“To combat climate change, improve air quality, and address the affordability crisis faced by everyday Californians, state leaders must stand up to protect and maintain continued investment in clean, efficient, and affordable public transit projects and services,” he said.
A contentious history 
California launched its cap-and-trade program in 2013 as a key tool for slashing greenhouse gas emissions. Created under the 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act, the system set a declining cap on emissions from major polluters and allowed businesses to buy and sell permits, creating a market for emissions.
By 2017, then-Gov. Jerry Brown faced a critical inflection point. The program was set to expire in 2020, and Brown sought to extend it through 2030. But the path to reauthorization was anything but smooth.
The political lift came in securing a two-thirds vote in the Legislature, the threshold that would help inoculate the program from legal attacks, given that California voters expanded the definition of a tax in 2010.
That supermajority required bipartisan support, and Brown courted moderate Republicans with concessions: tax breaks for manufacturers, fee waivers for rural residents and spending assurances.
Newsom’s proposal would maintain many of the program’s most controversial provisions. Those include free emission permits for the oil and gas industry, a price ceiling mechanism and the use of carbon offsets, which have drawn criticism over concerns about their effectiveness. The governor’s proposal leaves most of the details up to the discretion of the Air Resources Board, which oversees the cap and trade program.
One key issue is the number of free allowances to industry, including the oil and gas industry. Newsom’s proposal could extend many of those giveaways through 2045, said climate expert Danny Cullenward, vice chair of an independent advisory cap and trade committee.
Cullenward told CalMatters that the market will likely begin shifting from a surplus of pollution permits to a scarcity. That will raise emissions reductions and state revenue, but also potentially increase consumer costs, with key decisions left to the Air Resources Board.
“It’ll bring in more money to the state, but it’ll also have higher consumer price impacts,” Cullenward said. “That’s going to be a key issue.”
The cap and trade debate is unfolding amid growing concern over affordability in California — a theme running through nearly every aspect of the state’s climate policy. A new report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office raised questions about how much the program could cost Californians. For instance, the cap and trade program could add 74 cents to the cost of gasoline if credits rise to their highest levels, amounting to about an additional $700 a year for the average California household, the report said. 
Of the $12.8 billion spent so far, nearly $9.2 billion has been invested in projects that benefit disadvantaged communities that are designated as a priority, according to the air board. 
The cap and trade debate is unfolding amid growing concern over affordability in California — a theme running through nearly every aspect of the state’s climate policy.
But environmental justice advocates have long criticized the program for failing to reduce local pollution in those communities, which often bear the cost of higher gasoline prices, too. Because cap and trade allows companies to comply with greenhouse gas limits by buying credits, they can continue operating in low-income neighborhoods without reducing emissions there.
Advocacy groups have asked the Legislature to reject a plan similar to the governor’s that would largely leave the program unchanged.
“Our communities, who bear the disproportionate burden of some of the worst air quality in the state, and the nation, are also predominantly communities of color,” Connie Cho, senior policy advisor for the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, said at a state Senate hearing earlier this month.
“We believe it is not only possible, but absolutely necessary, to achieve and balance all three: climate, health equity and affordability through the cap and trade program as the cost of living rises to a fever pitch.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/102023-High-Speed-Rail-LV_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

The cost of the low-income health insurance program has been growing rapidly.,"In summary
Newsom’s Medi-Cal budget plan would shift money for voter-approved increases in doctors’ pay and reproductive care to cover other expenses. The cost of the low-income health insurance program has been growing rapidly.




Six months after California voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative that increases the pay of doctors treating Medi-Cal patients, Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to divert that money to cover other health costs.
Newsom last week proposed using $1.6 billion generated by Proposition 35 over the next two years to help address California’s $12 billion state deficit. The governor said the spending plan is allowable under the ballot measure, while doctors, hospitals, clinics and others who support the measure are crying foul.
Rising costs are making Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance for low-income people, unsustainable, triggering a controversy over use of funds that voters earmarked for specific health costs, such as doctor’s pay and women’s reproductive health.
In addition to reallocating the Prop. 35 funds, the governor also wants to move $500 million from the state tobacco tax into the state’s general fund. That money, which voters approved in a 2016 ballot measure, is supposed to support family planning and women’s health care, among other services. 
Health advocates say the governor’s proposals for shifting the money will weaken the state’s health safety net and hamstring reproductive health care.
Planned Parenthood said the double hit from Newsom’s Prop. 35 and tobacco tax proposals in the state budget could cripple its services. 
Jodi Hicks, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and co-chair of the Yes on Prop. 35 campaign, called Newsom’s proposal “shocking” and “plain cruel.” She said Planned Parenthood would lose a third of its budget if it is approved by the Legislature next month. Low-income patients would have to contend with longer wait times, fewer appointment options and potentially need to drive further to access care. 
“Our footprint is so large in sexual and reproductive health care in California. There is no way for other clinics to absorb that,” Hicks said.
Newsom’s proposal comes at a time when the Republican-led Congress is contemplating deep cuts to Medicaid. Included is cutting off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. (Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.) “We need the state to help us prepare, not make things significantly worse,” Hicks said.

The use of state health funds will likely be a centerpiece as the state Legislature negotiates a budget deal with Newsom over the next month. A final budget is due June 15. 
The state’s Democratic lawmakers, who have a supermajority in the Legislature, have largely balked at Newsom’s changes to Medi-Cal, which also include freezing new enrollment for most adults without permanent legal status.
“I’m disheartened that the Governor’s updated budget is riddled with deep cuts to our constituents’ healthcare. We cannot boast about having the fourth-largest economy while balancing our budget on the back of everyday Californians’ healthcare,” Assembly Health Committee Chair Mia Bonta, a Democrat from Oakland, said in a statement.
Is it legal to move Prop. 35 funds?
Prop. 35, approved by 68% of California voters in November, was designed to guarantee doctors would get paid more to serve patients covered by Medi-Cal. Reimbursement rates for Medi-Cal are so low that patients often struggle to find doctors who will accept their insurance. 
Prop. 35 uses a special tax paid by health insurance plans to generate revenue for Medi-Cal. Most of the money — $9 billion in 2024-25 — goes to the state’s general fund. But the additional $1.6 billion that Newsom wants to take for general Medi-Cal spending was supposed to be reserved to increase the amount doctors get paid for specific services, such as primary care, specialty care and emergency room visits.  
Newsom’s budget proposal would instead use the $1.6 billion intended for doctors’ pay increases to support higher Medi-Cal spending for primary care, specialty care, ambulances and hospital outpatient procedures. 
Planned Parenthood and the California Medical Association helped lead the industry group that put the measure on the ballot. 
In a statement, Dr. Shannon Udovic-Constant, president of the medical association, called Newsom’s budget proposal a “direct violation of the will of California voters.”
“The proposition was passed to prevent exactly this kind of maneuver – raiding health care funding to solve budget problems,” she said.

When questioned about the move during a budget presentation on Wednesday, Newsom denied this characterization and said the proposed spending is “absolutely consistent” with the rules established by the ballot measure. 
Newsom repeatedly blamed Prop. 35 for causing part of the state’s budget shortfall and called it and other recent ballot measures “unfunded initiatives.” 
The governor said Medi-Cal has a growth problem that the state cannot afford. 
State spending on Medi-Cal has more than doubled since 2017 and is now projected to cost $76.8 billion in the 2024-25 budget year. Earlier this year lawmakers approved an extra $6 billion for unexpected Medi-Cal costs.

Linnea Koopmans, chief executive of the Local Health Plans of California and chair of the Prop. 35 advisory committee, said in a statement to CalMatters that Newsom’s budget does not reflect California’s values. 
“Undoubtedly, the state budget challenge is real, but sweeping more than $1 billion of (Prop. 35) revenue is not an option. These funds must be used to support Medi-Cal investments in providers and workforce that are necessary to improve access to care,” Koopmans said. 
The Prop. 35 advisory committee was established by the ballot initiative to oversee how the state spends the money.
Industry supporters of the measure say Newsom’s proposal doesn’t actually pay doctors more; it conflates increased costs associated with Medi-Cal’s growing enrollment with payment. 
Molly Weedn, a spokesperson for the Yes on 35 campaign, said in a statement that the budget proposal raises “serious legal concerns.”
“The Governor proposes using Prop. 35 funding to cover already incurred costs in Medi-Cal and not for increasing provider payments to increase access to health care,” Weedn said.
The most contentious part of the debate comes down to whether he’s using the Prop. 35 money to pay the state’s general expenses, not just health care. 
The Newsom administration’s finance department said in a document shared with CalMatters that doctors’ pay is reviewed and increased annually, which aligns with Prop. 35’s requirements. The department also denies that using the money to pay for Medi-Cal would replace general fund spending because the amount that the state is taking from the general fund for Medi-Cal continues to grow. 
Critics say these standard adjustments are not necessarily a true rate increase for doctors — they mostly reflect increased Medi-Cal costs as a result of more patients enrolling or more expensive care being provided. In order to substantially increase how much doctors get paid, the state would have to submit an application for federal approval, which it has not done.
“It appears the caseload growth in Medi-Cal is being used to justify the need for these funds,” said Jennifer Kent, an advisor to the Prop. 35 campaign and former director of the health care services department. 
Newsom isn’t the first governor to sweep money approved by voters into the general fund, and his budget proposal also mirrors a move made by his predecessor, Jerry Brown, in 2017 to eliminate payments made for family planning, women’s health and dentistry by the state tobacco tax.
Amy Moy, co-chief executive of Essential Access Health, which provides grants to clinics for reproductive health care, said the governor’s proposed cuts jeopardize California’s commitment to making abortion, contraceptives and other reproductive health services accessible. 
Moy, a member of the Proposition 35 stakeholder advisory committee, said she is confident the final budget approved by the Legislature will pull back some of Newsom’s proposed cuts. 
“Ultimately we believe that California’s commitment, including our administration’s commitment, to sexual and reproductive health will be reflected in the final budget.”

California lawmakers cut them off,Ryan Sabalow and Hans Poschman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/05/california-legislature-silenced-public-hearings/,"As lawmakers rush through thousands of bills in Sacramento and make decisions in secret, regular Californians are often silenced.","In summary
As lawmakers rush through thousands of bills in Sacramento and make decisions in secret, regular Californians are often silenced.


Landon Morrison, a recovering addict, wanted to tell California lawmakers why they should support legislation he believes will hold troubled drug and alcohol treatment centers accountable.
He was told he would only get two minutes to speak, so he spent hours writing and rehearsing exactly what he wanted to say. But after getting on the road at 4 a.m. for the six-hour drive to Sacramento from Los Angeles County, Morrison didn’t get to say a single word because previous speakers talked for too long.
The committee’s Democratic chairperson, Sen. Caroline Menjivar of Van Nuys, ended testimony in support of the bill after five minutes.
“In a way, this kind of articulated the stigma of addiction. … I’m at the bottom of the line, you know?” Morrison said. “It was just kind of very disheartening.”
Morrison’s experience is hardly unique in the California Legislature as lawmakers try to jam through the more than 2,000 bills lawmakers have introduced so far this year. Over the past two months, CalMatters journalists witnessed more than a dozen examples of committee leaders cutting speakers off midway through their remarks or prohibiting them from talking at all because other people went over the few minutes that members of the public are given to testify.
Lawmakers say the rules are necessary to accommodate the armies of paid lobbyists, political activists and members of the public who flood the Capitol each year to jockey for and against legislation. Lawmakers say they do their best to ensure everyone gets their say while aiming to keep hearings from dragging on well into the night.  
“Some bills you get dozens of people. Some bills you get over 100 people,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Democrat representing the Palo Alto area who oversees the Business and Professions Committee. “There is a real attempt to be fair on both sides and to everybody.”
The public comment limits are yet another symptom of lawmakers rushing through thousands of bills in the few months they’re in session in Sacramento – and usually waiting until right before key deadlines to push through the largest volume of bills.
‘Me too’ speakers get only seconds
To try to fit in all those wishing to speak, most members of the public who show up at the Capitol can only express their positions through what’s known as the “me too” portion of a hearing.
After the lead witnesses in support or opposition of a bill each get to deliver two minutes of testimony, others approach the microphone and state their name, organization and whether they support or oppose it. In 2023, legislative leaders stopped allowing people to offer their comments remotely via Zoom as they had during the pandemic.

Lobbyists and other insiders usually know the drill and keep their “me toos” to a couple of seconds so the committee leaders don’t cut them off. 
But regular people who might not be familiar with the process regularly get shut down if they speak beyond a few seconds.
That happened to Albert Titman, Sr., a Native American man from the Sacramento area. He came to the Assembly Business and Professions Committee in late April to tell lawmakers why they should oppose a cannabis tax bill he thinks would harm disadvantaged tribal communities. 
But he wasn’t designated as a lead witness, so when he tried to speak during the “me too” portion of the hearing, Berman, the committee chairperson, told him to wrap it up.
“Now we’re just at the name, organization and position,” Berman reminded him as Titman grew frustrated.
“There’s not one Native person here,” Titman shot back. “Not one Native person.”
Capitol security ushered Titman away from the mic.
“They shut me down, just pretty much telling me to shut up, you know?” Titman said in an interview. “I wanted to actually sit up there and present my argument, but they wouldn’t allow me.”
Berman said later that he “felt very bad” for how things went with Titman, and he noted he did give Titman a little more time than the other “me too” speakers had. But Berman said he was obligated to keep the hearing moving. If a committee runs too long, it can delay the subsequent committees scheduled to use the same room.“I try to have a little flexibility, but you can’t let somebody talk for, you know, a minute who’s really just supposed to be providing their name, organization or affiliation and support or opposition to the bill,” he said. “Every time is a dance, and it’s not easy.”
Kathi Zollinger, a volunteer with the Lake Tahoe-based BEAR League, didn’t have security called on her last month when she approached the mic and tried to say why she opposed a  bear-hunting bill.
But she was still taken aback when Diane Papan, the Democratic chairperson of the Assembly Parks and Wildlife Committee, cut her off mid-sentence.

“I thought it was kind of rude,” she said afterward. Papan, who represents the San Mateo area, didn’t respond to an interview request.
One of the bear bill’s supporters, Elizabeth Washoe, took a day off work, filled up her vehicle with $5-plus a gallon gas before she left Modoc County and made the five-hour drive to the capital, only to be given a few seconds at the mic. 
In an interview, she said that as a Native American woman from a rural area, she left feeling that those living in the far reaches of the state have a harder time having their voices heard.
“I would love to have more time to say something,” she said. “It’s not equitable representation for rural areas.”
Democrat blocks comment on transgender bill 
Some people who get cut off believe it’s because a committee chair doesn’t like what they have to say. Opponents of a bill to allow transgender people to more easily change their names say that happened to them when the proposal was before the Assembly Health Committee on April 29.
The committee’s chairperson, Mia Bonta, a Democrat from Oakland, refused to give the lead witnesses for opponents their two minutes each. Bonta told them they hadn’t properly registered in advance.“I was very clear and the rules that the Health Committee adopted indicated that we needed to have registered opposition offering witness testimony,” she said. “And I reiterated that at the beginning of this hearing, and those are the rules of this committee.”
But the bill’s opponents said they could find no reference to the rules online. 
After driving from San Francisco to testify, Erin Friday, president of the group Our Duty, was furious. 
“Welcome to China,” she said. Another organization called Californians for Good Governance later filed a formal complaint over how the opponents were treated.
Bonta’s spokesperson, Daniel McGreevy, said in an email that Bonta’s actions were “consistent with updated guidelines which are established and read at the top of all recent hearings.”
In an interview, Friday said she regularly testifies in other states on similar legislation. She said no other state she’s been to is as restrictive about public comment in hearings. 
“I’m a lifelong Democrat, so I find it really quite amusing when (California Democrats) talk about Republicans not wanting to play by the rules, or constitutional chaos, when we have no voice whatsoever,” said Friday, whose organization believes there “is no such thing as a transgender child.” 
Are hearings mostly political theater?
After CalMatters highlighted last year the consequences of rushing through too many bills at the last minute, legislative leaders slightly lowered the amount of bills each lawmaker could introduce during the two-year session that began in December. It’s helped a little. At the bill filing deadline earlier this year, lawmakers had introduced 2,278 bills – down from 2,640 at the start of the last session.
The committees are still jam-packed, such as in late April, as lawmakers butted up against a deadline to advance their measures. Two Senate Judiciary Committee hearings discussed a combined 106 bills. One of those hearings went 11 hours. The final votes weren’t tallied until almost 11 p.m.

The public comment limits also underscore another problem that CalMatters has pointed out. The Democrats who control the Capitol often make their decisions behind closed doors.
It’s a trend reflected in the Digital Democracy database. Last session, just 25 bills failed because a majority of lawmakers voted “no ” during a committee hearing or a floor session. Plenty of bills still die — 2,403 of them were killed during the last two-year session — but they’re almost always spiked through secretive procedural tactics that leave the public with little way of knowing who is responsible.
Critics say that makes commenting in hearings mostly performative since it’s so rare for bills to be killed in public.
San Diego Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio says he doesn’t bother bringing witnesses to testify because he knows what they say won’t change anyone’s mind — and there’s a good chance they won’t get to say all they came to say anyway. It’s “all theater,” he said. “That’s irrelevant, because these politicians basically do their deals in back rooms, and they walk into the hearing already decided.”
Other ways to influence legislation
Legislators and Capitol insiders say people can influence legislation before committee hearings in plenty of other ways. Anyone can submit formal remarks on individual bills through the Legislature’s online position letter portal. 
They can also write or call lawmakers’ offices and request meetings with them or their staff, or speak to the politicians when they do events in their district, which can be more effective than showing up at a hearing whose outcome could be predetermined. 
Lobbyist Jennifer Fearing says she tells advocates that if they really want to be heard, facetime with a lawmaker in their district is best.
“You don’t have to change the whole system up here (in Sacramento) to have that kind of impact,” Fearing said. “A minute in a hearing is not a substitute for a relationship at home.” 
For Morrison, a recovering addict, the trip to Sacramento wasn’t a total loss. 
Sen. Tom Umberg, the bill’s author, felt badly that Morrison got cut off and arranged for him to speak on a related measure.
Umberg, a Democrat representing the Santa Ana area, said it was the least he could do for a “civilian” — his term for those who aren’t paid advocates. As chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he said he tries to prioritize bills with more “civilian” speakers.
Still, Morrison said that while Umberg treated him well, the experience was a letdown. 
He thought testifying would be “an honor and a prestige.” Instead, “It’s like well, no, that’s really not that big a deal,” he said. “They slap you to the side.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031224_Happiness-Comittee_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

Jordan Haedtler is a climate financial policy strategist with Climate Cabinet and a former legislative staffer in the state Assembly.


Climate change has thrown insurance markets into dysfunction, and the situation is about to get more dire. As the epicenter of a global insurance crisis, it is critical that California formulates a strong response. 
Creating and funding public catastrophe models, like the one called for in California’s Senate Bill 429, is a good start. It seeks a model that would help regulators, insurers and others assess wildfire risk and future losses.
Under the Trump administration, the federal government is abandoning its responsibility to support communities facing climate catastrophe. It’s shifting costs onto state governments by gutting FEMA and slashing funding for crucial weather data and climate adaptation. Many businesses, including insurance companies, rely heavily on this data. These harmful federal cuts are leaving the public vulnerable.
Public catastrophe models like the one proposed in SB 429 can serve as a check on the proprietary “black box” risk prediction models insurers use to justify rate increases and to conceal information from customers about how to reduce risk.
California has smartly invested billions of dollars in wildfire mitigation over the past decade. Insurers should be required to factor that into their underwriting.
Unfortunately a bill requiring them to do so stalled in the California Senate last session, exacerbating concerns over whether Californians will be able to access the insurance market after January’s devastating wildfires.
Public catastrophe models can help solve these problems. By providing greater transparency around modeling, they can blunt the negative fallout of our insurance crisis for consumers. By collecting sophisticated, granular information about climate risk, these public models can help inform and drive greater public investment in climate resilience. 
This data can be used to inform government investments in risk reduction, such as ecological forest management and floodplain management, which will likely make insurance markets much healthier over time. 
Without a public alternative, the proprietary models used by insurance companies are what we are left with.
There is little information about the inputs used in these private models, and they have been shown to have big flaws. Analyses of some of the most commonly used proprietary risk modelers from insurance companies have revealed glaring inconsistencies that could increase costs for Californians and elevate the risks for homeowners.
In a March report outlining a road to recovery from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers at UCLA and the University of Southern California called for more reliable data and stronger coordination between government agencies, the insurance sector and individual households. They argued for substantial investments in climate resilience and urged that those investments be incorporated into insurance models. 
A public catastrophe model would be useful in supporting all of that work. It would also help guarantee that Californians see the benefits of the mitigation investments they are making through more widely available and affordable insurance policies. 
During the Biden administration, the Federal Insurance Office recommended that state insurance offices build a platform to collaborate on catastrophe model data and methodology. Biden’s White House even floated the concept of a national catastrophe model to host that effort. 
Trump is now dismantling all of the federal agencies that might have housed such a platform, while also failing to act on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request for federal aid for the L.A. wildfires. 
With the federal government no longer a reliable partner, it is more important than ever that states like California take the lead in protecting consumers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_37.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end, too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
 

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states 

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
  Creating a new food system 

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
 

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

This reporting was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation’s Fund for Indigenous Journalists: Reporting on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Two Spirit and Transgender People (MMIWG2T).









On a summer evening in 2019, a man living in a hilltop house in the Navajo community of Nenahnezad called 911 to report a body in the dirt road in front of his home.“The guy is not breathing, nothing,” he told the operator.
The person he discovered was Kyle Jackson, a 31-year-old citizen of the Navajo Nation.
Kyle had fought with another man at a nearby house hours before his body was found, according to witness interviews by law enforcement. Severely injured, Kyle was kicked out of the house. It’s unclear how long he lay in the road before dying, but at least one other person passed by without stopping to help him, about six hours before the call to police.
In the following weeks, his mother, Colleen Harrison Jackson, visited the spot where his body was found and spoke with the 911 caller, along with some of his friends who had been with him in the days leading up to his death.

She put her faith in the Navajo Department of Criminal Investigations and the FBI — one of the agencies on the case because Kyle’s body was found on the reservation. Over the next few years, she called investigators from both agencies for updates. They would get back to her sometimes, but not always. She also reached out to an FBI victim specialist, who would tell her the investigators were still working on the case, so she remained hopeful they would eventually make an arrest.
Then she got the letter.
The FBI had closed its investigation, the specialist wrote to Colleen in March 2022.
The letter provided a nine-word explanation: The United States Attorney’s Office had declined to prosecute.
Standing in front of the post office, Colleen cried as she read those words.
“No one called me and said, ‘We’re going to close this case, this is why.’ No one called me,” she said. “I just get this letter, and I was very upset because I didn’t know what happened. I really just broke down.”
To this day, no one has been tried for killing Kyle.
Colleen isn’t alone. She’s one of thousands who have lost loved ones to a national crisis of Indigenous people disproportionately dying of homicide or going missing.
Infrequent updates from law enforcement, many affected families say, have intensified the pain they’re already feeling. That was one of the key findings of the federal Not Invisible Act Commission, which, in a 2023 report, made numerous recommendations aimed at police and prosecutors improving the way they communicate with families.
In an interview with New Mexico In Depth last year, former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico Alexander Uballez and two prosecutors in the office’s Indian Country Crimes section acknowledged the harm done to families when the federal government delivers difficult news about their loved ones’ cases through the mail.
During his tenure, which began in May 2022, the office established a policy of updating families in person when possible, according to Uballez.
A Not Invisible Act Commission member says that’s a step in the right direction.
But Uballez, who announced his run for Albuquerque mayor in April, has since resigned at the request of President Donald Trump.
The new U.S. attorney for the district, Ryan Ellison, didn’t answer a question about whether the policy Uballez described will remain, but said in an email that prosecutors working closely with families is important.
Growing up in northwestern New Mexico, Kyle spent time playing along the San Juan River, fishing at a nearby dam with his grandpa, and helping take care of his siblings and cousins. He was an avid reader and enjoyed working on science projects for school fairs.
His childhood love of the outdoors continued into adulthood, and he often went on hikes and camping trips. In 2016, he graduated from San Juan College with an associate of applied science degree in the college’s industrial maintenance mechanic program.
Kyle “never let things get him down,” Colleen said, and looked out for others. As a teenager, he urged his mom to let friends who had unstable home lives stay with their family, she said.
A former girlfriend, Christa Perez, first met Kyle when they were in high school. They reconnected over a decade later and started dating. Perez is a single mom with three kids and was struggling at the time, she said.
“If it wasn’t for Kyle, I think I’d still be drinking. I’d still be lost,” Perez said. “He was there for me no matter what.”
He taught her kids how to play a card game, and to this day, Perez said, they ask, “Are we going to play Kyle’s cards or regular cards?”
They broke up about a year before his death but kept in touch, up until the week he died.
A violent evening
Colleen shared with New Mexico In Depth a Shiprock police incident report, the letter she received from the FBI in 2022, and a report of findings from the University of New Mexico’s Office of the Medical Investigator, which found Kyle had died of blunt head trauma. The news organization obtained the recording of the 911 call and dispatch log from San Juan County, along with records maintained by the FBI, primarily summaries of witness interviews from which names have been redacted.
On the night of Friday, June 21, at about 9 p.m., Kyle and two other people went to a nearby store to pick up alcohol. Later that night, he ended up at a house in Nenahnezad, where, according to the witness interviews, he and another man fought.
Kyle “may have been struck with a hammer,” according to the report of findings. He then “moved about the home, bleeding on various surfaces, before being kicked out” early Saturday morning with facial and skull fractures.
At about noon on Saturday, a man driving to visit a friend in the area saw Kyle lying in the road, he later told a Navajo criminal investigator. The man believed Kyle, who appeared to have been “beaten badly,” was dead. He continued up the road and saw busted windows on the house he intended to visit.  Not wanting to get involved, he turned around.
When he drove past Kyle again to leave the area, he was “moving around a little bit.” The man “was afraid the guy might get up and turn on him,” so he drove off just as it began to rain.
Trying to make sense of why the man didn’t help Kyle, Colleen said she thinks people in her community are hesitant to call law enforcement because they’re skeptical arrests will come out of it, and there are fears about retaliation.
The 911 call didn’t come in until about 6:30 p.m. that day.
The caller told the operator he had just arrived home from Farmington when he found Kyle’s body in the road out front.
“Does he look to be beyond any help?” the operator asked.
“Nope, nope, not even breathing, nothing,” the caller said. “He looks—he got hit or something. There’s a hole in the side of his temple.”
Emergency medical services and then officers with the Navajo Nation’s Shiprock Police District arrived over the next 40 minutes. Several other people later arrived at the scene, a police officer wrote in his report, including Kyle’s grandmother, who asked to see his body.
At about the same time, Colleen was a few miles away, hosting a birthday party for her daughter. She learned about her son’s death later that night from his grandmother.
“I knew something was wrong already. I could feel it,” Colleen said. “And when she told me, I don’t even know what happened after that. I couldn’t even breathe.”
The letter
Early on in the investigation, the family was told there was a suspect, and the suspect’s arrest might be on the news in another week, Colleen said.
Weeks turned into months, though, and that never happened. But when Colleen would call for updates, an FBI victim specialist would sometimes get back to her and say investigators were still working on the case.
So the letter — dated March 17, 2022, nearly three years after Kyle’s death — came as a shock.
The FBI had closed its investigation because the U.S. Attorney’s Office had declined to prosecute, the victim specialist wrote. The decision didn’t “lessen the important contribution” Colleen made to the investigation, the letter reads, and her “assistance and cooperation were greatly appreciated.”
Colleen called the Navajo criminal investigator and asked him to explain.
The investigator arranged a meeting with the FBI agent. During that sit-down, which Colleen remembers happening about four months after she received the letter, they told her there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute.
They said the case could be reopened if another witness came forward, Colleen said.
That was almost three years ago. There have been no updates since.
In a late February interview, Uballez, the former U.S. attorney, wouldn’t talk about Kyle’s case, saying the office typically doesn’t comment on investigations, whether they’re open or closed. But he spoke more generally about how a federal prosecutor decides whether to file charges. (Uballez was sworn into office in May 2022, two months after Colleen received the letter from the FBI.)
FBI agents assigned to a case, Uballez said, can “procedurally, look at it themselves” and decide to not refer it for prosecution. Or “they could look at it and say, either, ‘We’re sort of on the fence and we want you guys to make the call,’ or, ‘We think there’s a charge there,’” Uballez said.
Federal prosecutors then evaluate whether there were any constitutional rights violations and whether they think a case could be proven to a jury, he said.
“It’s a different calculus,” Uballez said. “Even though we may agree we know who did this, what happened, it doesn’t mean that we should charge.”
In the dark
In 2023, the federal Not Invisible Act Commission heard testimony from at least 260 people who have lost loved ones to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people or survived human trafficking. The commission visited seven cities, including Albuquerque.
One of the major themes from the hearings, the commission wrote in a report published in October that year, was that “authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months about the investigation.”
“Tragically, a case may be declared ‘cold’ without a family receiving any information about the investigation,” the report reads.
Asked what has stuck with her most from the hearings, Amber Kanazbah Crotty, a commission member and Navajo Nation Council delegate, said families’ disappointment with law enforcement either communicating with them infrequently or in ways that don’t feel compassionate.
“They’re dealing with their missing relative, or there may have been violence, a homicide or a criminal element to their case, but with the lack of communication from law enforcement, it just adds on another layer of, they don’t feel that their relatives mattered,” Crotty said in an April interview.
Instead of mailing a family a piece of paper informing them their relative’s case has been closed, she said, the commission recommended “a warm hand off.”
“It’s not the U.S. attorney themselves, but at least a victim advocate to be there to answer any questions they have, and they’re then referring them or connecting them to community resources like behavioral health, mental health support groups, so they’re not feeling like this is only happening to them and nobody cares about their relatives,” Crotty said.
Improving communication
The Justice Department since 2010 has required every U.S. Attorney’s Office with tribal lands in its district to develop an operational plan for addressing public safety in Indian country.
“A trauma-informed approach both considers the emotional impact on victims and their families and is culturally sensitive,” reads the New Mexico office’s plan, last updated in 2024. “The relationship between Tribal communities and the federal government is a fraught one. [Assistant U.S. attorneys] and law enforcement need to acknowledge this history and work hard to gain the trust of Tribal members who may have reasons to distrust the federal government and law enforcement based on past experiences and long histories.”
While the office can’t share all the details of an investigation or why it made a particular decision, staff have been working to do a better job of communicating with affected families, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal said during an interview last year. Neal was hired in 2023 as part of the Justice Department’s Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Regional Outreach Program.
One “challenge” the office identified in recent years, Neal said, was families not hearing from law enforcement for long periods of time and then receiving letters — like the one Colleen got — “out of the blue.”
In response, the office instituted a policy of giving families case updates in person when possible, Indian Country Crimes Section Supervisor Elisa Dimas said during last year’s interview.
“We’ve made it a real priority to understand the emotional impact that these cases have on families, to make sure that we go out and deliver this news in person, if we can, along with the victim advocate,” Dimas said. “Because even though we might not be pursuing a criminal case at our office, we know that there are still resources and support that we can provide, either through the victim advocates or community resources, to these families.”
That practice “came naturally to a lot of us” based on prior experience working with crime victims and their families, Uballez said in the February interview.
“What we did was expand the responsibility to include this more victim-centric, community-centric—you know, to build in time for people to build those relationships. And of course, if resources get drawn down there, either in personnel, or priorities elsewhere get expanded, that could change,” Uballez said, referring to Trump administration directives.
Asked if the in-person-when-possible policy will remain, Ellison, who was sworn in as New Mexico’s U.S. attorney on April 18, said in an email sent by spokesperson Tessa DuBerry that he understands “the importance of working with families of violent crimes to ensure there is justice for what they have suffered.”
“I encourage the prosecutors working with victims of violent crimes, including those in Indian Country, to work closely with these families as their cases proceed through federal court,” Ellison wrote.
‘All for Kyle’
In the spring before his death, Kyle gave his mother a packet of flower seeds.
Colleen enjoyed gardening, but she hadn’t done it in a long time, and the packet ended up in a drawer somewhere.
A few years ago, she was cleaning up around her house when she came across it.
“I just broke down. I remembered him giving that to me, and I said, ‘I’m going to make a garden.’ So I put flowers all over my front yard, and I’m starting on the back. Trees, flowers, and it’s growing,” she said. “It’s all for Kyle.”
Colleen has worked doggedly to find answers and get Kyle’s case reopened since receiving the letter in 2022.
She’s attended events, sometimes as far away as three hours south in Albuquerque, to ask for help from federal and tribal officials. She’s created posters with photos of her son and information about his death to take to rallies and gotten to know other Indigenous families with relatives who have been killed or gone missing. And she has repeatedly followed up with the investigators and filed records requests to try to learn more about their efforts.
She has her own theories about what happened to Kyle, but she worries she’ll never know definitively who killed her son or why they did it, let alone that they’ll face criminal charges.
“It’s a nightmare, and my family is not the same,” Colleen said. “And I don’t know how—you never come back from this. You don’t come back from it. You can adjust to it, but my life is different now, it’s just so different.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nmindepthmay191-1024x763.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

It and other waterways raged out of their banks in overnight flash flooding, only to recede with debris strewn about.
County commissioners huddled inside the courthouse, one block from a muddy rodeo ring, discussing bridge inspections and the path forward. Some washed-out areas were only accessible by four-wheel drive.
They’d put up more “road closed” signs, the commissioners said, if only people would stop stealing them. 
Ozark County — estimated population 9,090 — is used to doing without. A mere nick in the Bible Belt, it doesn’t even have a stoplight.
What it does have is a 24-bed jail with a cattle trough baptismal pool in the recreational area. 
It also has an ambitious sheriff who sees his prayers answered in a new contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that could boost his $1.1 million annual budget.

“It’s a pain in the butt because this is a whole new ground that we are covering, but then, you know, when you are one of the poorest counties in the state of Missouri, I’ve got to figure out how to pay for law enforcement,” Sheriff Cass Martin told the Marshall Project – St. Louis. “And that’s not easy, especially when you can’t even get new recruits. Nobody wants to be in law enforcement. It’s dying.”
Ozark County is one of many places, big and small, that the Trump administration is depending on to pull off one of the largest mass deportations from the U.S. in recent history. An enormous ramp-up in detention capacity is underway. New contracts are being negotiated. Existing contracts with the federal government are being expanded. In the ICE contract’s infancy, Ozark County is already reaping the benefits by raising wages and hiring for new positions in law enforcement.
As of early May, tracking reports show ICE contracting with or operating 147 public and private detention facilities, including three in Missouri. That’s up from 107 facilities reported in the final days of the Biden administration. On Feb. 24, Martin signed a contract for Ozark County, which isn’t yet on the list.
ICE plans to spend $45 billion on new contracts to hold and transport detainees and provide detainee services, according to a federal request for proposals. Counties like Ozark are getting a taste in federal dollars of what that expansion means. 
Sheriffs say the feds pay well, yet the detention and transportation contracts come with much more scrutiny and oversight than typical jail work, especially in Missouri, which doesn’t have statewide jail standards. 
Still, ICE reported that eight detainees had died nationally while in custody this year, as of May 5, including one death in a rural Missouri jail that the local coroner ruled a suicide. In 2024, ICE reported 11 deaths.
Some groups that advocate for ICE detainees are concerned that people from all over the world are increasingly being held in communities without well-established legal watchdogs and medical services.
Contracting with local jails “is the easiest way to get a (detention) facility up and running without any of the risk to the federal government,” said Romelia Graefrath, co-executive director of Mariposa Legal, a nonprofit in Indianapolis that fights for immigrant rights. “The end result is people get hurt, and then that is a huge liability for these communities that are already suffering.”
 ICE detention

Martin said he applied for an ICE contract under the Biden administration when his department faced a budget crisis from falling revenue.
“We were really hurting,” he said. “We were basically praying that next month will be better.” The ICE application lay dormant until Trump was elected, he said. 
“The day after the inauguration, a federal inspector showed up here at the jail wanting to look at everything throughout the facility,” he said.
The negotiated ICE contract will breathe new life into his department at a rate of $110 a night per detainee and $1.10 per mile when transporting detainees, Martin said. 
He said Ozark County was still working out medical care so it could be cleared to hold detainees longer than overnight. Meanwhile, it has three transport vans out on the road, sometimes driving hundreds of miles per day.
He said they’ve made 525-mile runs from Ozark County to the federal building in St. Louis, down to the Greene County Jail in southwest Missouri, then back home. They’ve picked up detainees 325 miles away in Oklahoma and taken them to the tarmac at Kansas City International Airport. Sometimes detainees spend the night in the Ozark County Jail, on the way to Little Rock, Arkansas, for example, which is about a 3½-hour drive. 
“We’ll feed them, we’ll house them, we’ll take care of them, and then the next morning they’ll go back out,” Martin said. “We are just kind of a spot in the road.”
Because of the ICE contract, Martin said, he’s been able to attract more jail staff and raise the pay from about $13 to $18 an hour. In addition to mileage, he said ICE pays $18.50 an hour for drivers transporting detainees, as well as time and a half for overtime.
Martin plucked one new employee who speaks Spanish from a local real estate office. She went through a short training program to be a transport officer. 
“It definitely enlightened her a little bit,” Martin said. “They are able to talk to her and tell her if something is going on.”
The staffing bump was reflected in the public payroll. 
In February, the county paid five jail employees a total of $12,900 in earnings, which came to an average of $2,580 each. By March, it had 14 employees earning $54,193, including about $10,500 in overtime, or an average of $3,871 each. 
“We’d like to add another pod to the jail and at some point help pay livable wages,” said Brian Wise, the county clerk. “Around here, local law enforcement doesn’t have tons of money. Without extra revenue, they can’t function.”
It’s hard to gauge what local residents think. Just one attended a recent county commissioner meeting. Two years’ worth of meeting minutes didn’t mention the ICE contract in detail. Wise said he wanted to wait until federal money started coming in before listing projected revenue in the county’s $7 million annual budget.   
Other elected local officials also see the contract as a boon.  
“It’s going to work out to be a great thing for us,” Ozark County Presiding Commissioner Terry Newton said.
 Death in a Missouri jail

While cash-strapped jails see opportunity in ICE contracts, Brayan Garzón, a former street vendor in Bogotá, Colombia, saw opportunity in the United States. 
He left in 2023 and crossed the U.S. border into southern California. Garzón was then detained for three months before settling in St. Louis, where he held various odd jobs doing roofing and food deliveries, his family said.
On May 27, 2024, Garzón was arrested for shoplifting in Missouri. Two weeks later, an immigration judge in San Diego, at a hearing Garzón wasn’t present for, ordered him removed from the country, ICE officials said.
In late March, St. Louis police arrested Garzón on a charge of using a stolen credit card at a smoke shop. He was arrested along with a friend from Colombia who was accused of stealing credit cards, a watch and more than $25,000 in jewelry while cleaning hotel rooms for a temp agency, according to court records. ICE took both into custody. 
Garzón ended up being held 100 miles southwest of St. Louis in the Phelps County Jail. On March 27, a medical intake screening of Garzón at the jail noted that he had anxiety and a history of a heart murmur. He denied having suicidal thoughts. A routine mental health referral was made, according to an ICE report.
Two days later, Garzón had severe head pain, body aches and sweating. A tuberculosis test came back positive. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 at a local hospital’s emergency room after being taken there by the jail staff. He was returned to the jail a day later, on March 30, with normal vitals. But a few days later, he was treated for vomiting. His mental health appointment was rescheduled because of “mental health clinic time and staff” and his COVID-19 diagnosis.
Around 9:50 p.m. on April 7, Garzón was found near death in his cell with a blanket wrapped around his neck. He was pronounced dead the following day, after being flown to a hospital in the St. Louis area for a higher level of care, ICE said in its report. 
Garzón was in his cell alone prior to his suicide, according to Phelps County Coroner Ernie Coverdell. Garzón had given a letter to his jailers written in Spanish, requesting to speak to his mother by telephone. Coverdell said surveillance footage showed Garzón praying before entering a bottom bunk, hidden by a draped blanket. When a jailer found him unresponsive about 20 minutes later, Coverdell said Garzón looked like he was asleep, but with bedding around his neck.
Emergency responders and doctors kept his heart beating for several days after he was declared clinically dead, Coverdell said. With his family’s permission, Garzón’s heart and several organs were donated to people in need. 
“He saved more than one life,” Coverdell said. 
Garzón, one of six siblings, was 27. 
His mother, Adriana, said in Spanish that she’d spoken to her son several times by phone from the jail. He’d complained about the food and being sick, but she was blindsided by his suicide.
“My son had more will to live than to die,” she said. “He was a very happy person.”  
She struggled to comprehend how he fell through the cracks of a country rich in resources and modern technology. 
“How is it possible that my son could do this?” she said. “He’s a human being. They should have been watching.”
The Phelps County Jail has a long history of holding detainees for the federal government. In an effort to hold more, the facility just underwent a $21 million expansion that doubled the size of the jail to 400 beds.
A few weeks prior to Garzón’s arrival, Phelps County Sheriff Michael Kirn’s department was struggling to pay January and February invoices “due to lack of funds,” according to county commission meeting minutes. 
Kirn told commissioners that it was imperative to get the ICE agreement in place because he expected it to generate an additional $3.6 million a year on top of the sheriff’s typical budget of $5.5 million.
Kirn declined to comment about the death because it was under investigation by state and federal authorities. He said no policies or procedures have been changed or added since Garzón’s death. 
The county’s existing contract with the U.S. Marshals — who track down dangerous fugitives and enforce federal law — was expanded to include ICE detainees, Kirn said. He declined to share the rate. 
“The feds are a little funny about stuff, and I don’t want to cause ripples,” he said.
He said they were hovering at about 300 out of 400 beds filled, half of them with federal detainees.
“We had to slow down,” he said. “It’s not the amount of people; it’s the paperwork.” 
ICE officials didn’t respond to a request for comment. An April press release about Garzón’s death stated that the agency “remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”
 Brayan Garzón

Garzón’s death seemed to weigh on Martin, the sheriff in Ozark County. 
“He was so young,” Martin said. 
He wondered if there were any red flags leading up to the incident. And how did ICE respond?
Martin said if a jail resident is in a mental crisis in Ozark County, they rush them to the hospital for an emergency hold. That hadn’t been an issue with any of the ICE detainees they’d been transporting, he said.
“These guys are a little bit easier to deal with than our local inmates on most points,” he said. “They are, ‘Thank you, thank you for this. Thank you for food.’ They are appreciative of what we’ve got.” 
Martin said he doesn’t know all the ins and outs of why ICE detainees are in custody, but he wants to do a professional job.
“It’s not like going to the stockyard up here and watching cattle run through the chute. They are human beings,” Martin said. “My thing is, I promise that I can give them a safe place to put their head at night. I will feed them, and I will make sure that they are taken care of. And from there, wherever they are going, I hope everything turns out well for them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EDIT_IMG_7748-e1747656541654-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and corrections officers involved have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


“Don’t let these people kill me,” wrote another man from Donaldson Correctional Facility. “I’m scared for my life and that they will say I killed myself.”
The allegations are from three civil rights lawsuits among 124 that the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) has paid to settle since 2020. The vast majority involved complaints of excessive force inside Alabama’s violent and overcrowded prisons, according to a review of court records and state financial data.
An Alabama Reflector examination found that of 124 lawsuits that ADOC settled in the five-year period between 2020 and 2024, 94 involved complaints of excessive force. Other lawsuits alleged wrongful deaths and accused ADOC staff of failing to protect incarcerated people from violence, including assaults and rapes.
The cost of defending lawsuits against individual officers and larger, class-action cases against the entire department has pushed ADOC’s legal spending over $57 million since 2020. In the last five years, the department has spent over $17 million on the legal defense of accused officers and lawsuit settlements, along with over $39 million litigating a handful of complex cases against ADOC, including a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice over prison conditions.
Data on civil lawsuits and outcomes against other state prison systems is not readily available, but the sheer volume of excessive force cases ADOC is settling is significant, according to several correctional experts.
“That sounds extreme, in my experience,” said Steve Sinclair, who retired as Washington’s Department of Corrections Secretary in 2021 after a 32-year career in corrections. “It’s pretty routine to have lawsuits for various reasons, and not all of those are legit lawsuits. But certainly not 60 or 80 plus. It’s inconceivable to me.”
The 94 excessive force lawsuits were settled between 2020-2024, but resulted from incidents that occurred in the span between 2014-2022, and cover 15 of ADOC’s 26 institutions, including maximum, medium and minimum-security facilities.
Alleged acts of excessive force resulting in serious injury were documented everywhere from the Loxley community work center, a minimum-security facility housing 360 prisoners who work in the community, to death row at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, depicting an institutional landscape characterized by subterranean brutality.
Forty-five percent of the lawsuits detailed injuries so severe that the victims required hospitalization, ranging from lacerations requiring stitches to broken bones, many requiring surgery. Some complaints allege beatings that resulted in multiple injuries. Medical records submitted in court show one man had both arms broken in an incident involving an officer. Another man said he suffered broken ribs and broken bones in his back from a staff assault. A third was hospitalized with a broken leg and hand. Nineteen complaints described traumatic head and brain injuries. At least seven cases detailed catastrophic traumas that left the victims permanently disabled or disfigured.
The findings are the result of a monthslong investigation that included the examination of accounting data obtained from the Alabama Department of Finance detailing all payments made from the General Liability Trust Fund since 2020, as well as court records connected to the trust fund transactions.










Don't let these people kill me. I'm scared for my life and that they will say I killed myself. 


– Inmate, Donaldson Correctional Facility


The General Liability Trust Fund operates similarly to insurance, with a $1 million cap per incident, to cover both the legal defense of state employees and any potential settlement payment, also known as indemnity, to plaintiffs. State agencies pay an annual premium to participate. The fund is used for individual plaintiff-filed lawsuits that seek damages. Lawsuits filed against entire state agencies, like class-action litigation that seek to change policy, are paid for out of the state’s General Fund.
The increased volume of individual lawsuits filed against employees of ADOC comes as the department is embroiled in several class-action lawsuits against the entire system over prison labor and the lack of mental health treatment, as well as ongoing litigation with the U.S. Department of Justice, which sued the state in December 2020 after concluding that Alabama “failed or refused to correct” unconstitutional prison conditions, including the common use of excessive force.
A staff member from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Alabama’s Northern District said the lawsuit remains ongoing at this time, but would not provide any further details.
ADOC and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office continue to deny that the state’s prison problems amount to systemic constitutional violations, but lawyers for state employees are routinely using public dollars to quietly pay out dozens of lawsuit settlements—the amounts determined in confidential settlement negotiations or mediation, not reported in court filings, and outside stakeholder scrutiny. While settlements are not an admission of liability, these lawsuits were filed over the same conditions that led the DOJ to sue the state: overcrowding, understaffing, inadequate facilities, and “an excessive amount of violence, sexual abuse and prisoner deaths.”
The DOJ began investigating Alabama’s 13 prisons for men in 2016, and in 2019 released the first of two findings letters that detailed why the federal department found reasonable cause that conditions in ADOC violate the Eighth and 14th Amendment rights of prisoners, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment.
“All too often, correctional officers use force in the absence of a physical threat while making no effort to de-escalate tense situations,” the DOJ stated in its findings letter on excessive force. “Such uses of force heighten tensions in already violent and overcrowded prisons. Correctional officers also use force as a form of retribution and for the sole purpose of inflicting pain.”
In response to questions about the surge in excessive force lawsuits and settlements, an ADOC spokesperson pointed to the DOJ.
“Most are piggybacking off the allegations contained in the DOJ findings letters, which ADOC adamantly denies,” wrote ADOC’s spokesperson, Kelly Betts, in an email response.
Betts also wrote that ADOC “does not comment on pending litigation or confidential settlement negotiations and any resulting agreements,” and referred questions about the number of settlements or specific lawsuits to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which began handling most of ADOC’s civil litigation in 2023.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages seeking comment, including a list of submitted questions.
For decades, ADOC had no internal grievance process for people in prison to file complaints over officer abuse or misconduct. Without proper oversight inside the prisons, lawsuits can serve as a backstop for accountability.
Many legal rights and protections for people in prison have been put in place by the courts, and some of those cases started out as complaints from the prisoners themselves. Everything from the right to send and receive mail, to the right to basic medical care are the results of litigation, said one man who has filed lawsuits against ADOC officers in the past and asked to withhold his name out of fear of reprisal.
“There’s really no bottom to how badly a state will treat prisoners without the intervention and oversight of the courts,” he said. “Filing a lawsuit seeking damages is often the only meaningful way to challenge mistreatment in prison.”

‘A culture of impunity’

The 94 excessive force complaints that resulted in settlement payments to victims do not represent the total lawsuits filed against ADOC officers, many of which are dismissed by the courts.
“These are probably the most egregious examples of what is really a culture of impunity and violation of people’s rights,” said David Gespass, an attorney who has represented incarcerated people in excessive force cases against ADOC officers.
The complaints detail incidents occurring in various parts of the prisons — open dormitories and individual cells, but also prison barbershops, chow halls, health care units and bathrooms. Forty-five percent of complainants said officers beat them while they were handcuffed, and 27% alleged the excessive use of chemical spray, two factors cited in the DOJ’s findings.
The state’s highest security and most overcrowded prisons generated the most lawsuits in the time period examined. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer topped the list with 25 excessive force lawsuits ending in settlement, followed by Holman, St. Clair, Limestone and Bibb.
Some of the complaints include shocking and gruesome details.

The complaint stated an officer handcuffed the victim behind his back, then struck him from behind, “breaking his jaw in two places, sending a large portion of his jawbone between his teeth and spraying blood all over the wall.” ADOC settled the lawsuit for $90,000, and according to court documents, terminated the officer who assaulted the man.
2019 incident at Limestone. The complaint stated an officer placed the victim in a takedown position, known to cause “excruciating pain” in the shoulders, then another officer kicked his legs, causing him to fall and strike his head on the floor. Officers then sprayed him with mace, kicked and punched him. The man suffered a traumatic brain injury, permanent hearing loss, and numerous contusions, according to the complaint. The plaintiff was released from prison and died of an overdose in 2023, according to court documents. ADOC settled the lawsuit with his mother for $9,000.
2018 assault at Staton. The complaint stated that two officers sprayed the victim with pepper spray, beat him with batons, kicked and stomped him. The man was flown to a hospital in critical condition, where he was diagnosed with bleeding in the brain, multiple fractures to his ribs, face, head, back and damage to his lungs. The man is now in a long-term VA hospital “bedridden, unable to verbally communicate, and minimally conscious.” ADOC settled the lawsuit filed by his family for $55,000.

Five settlements stemmed from a raid at Holman prison in 2016 by ADOC’s “Correctional Emergency Response Team” or CERT. According to the complaints, CERT members charged into the dorm while the men inside were sleeping, shouting and beating men with batons. At least one man was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. The settlements totaled $13,500.
Two years later, another incident involving CERT at Holman led to an excessive force lawsuit filed by a man who uses a wheelchair. The man handwrote in his complaint that one officer slapped him, another hit him in the head with his baton.
“That blow busted my head and caused me to fall out of my wheelchair flat on the floor face down,” he wrote.
“They kicked and stomped on me so viciously until I defecated on myself. I was knocked out unconscious.” His lawsuit ended in a $7,000 settlement.

Prisoners injured during a medical event

At least a half dozen complaints alleged that officers used excessive force on incarcerated men who were in need of mental health or medical attention, including two filed by men who said they were beaten while having a seizure.
One such complaint accused officers at Bibb of beating a man with batons while he was suffering an epileptic seizure in the infirmary, “strapped or handcuffed into a gurney.” When his seizure was over and the beating stopped, officers accused the man of using drugs, which he denied, according to the complaint. They then “chained plaintiff to a wall as he continued to bleed and exhibit clear epileptic symptoms.”
The incarcerated man presented witness statements from other prisoners and prison staff to support his claim, but officers argued their use of force was justified because the plaintiff was violent and unrestrained.
A federal judge denied the officers’ motions to dismiss the case.
“The court finds that a reasonable jury would have difficulty not concluding that prison officers beating a fully restrained, possibly unconscious prisoner who had just suffered an epileptic seizure ‘offends contemporary standards of decency,’” U.S. District Judge Karen Owen Bowdre wrote.
ADOC settled the lawsuit for $30,000.

“Excessive force should always be treated like a big deal,” said former Washington Department of Corrections Secretary Steve Sinclair. “If you tolerate or minimize it, that’s what builds a horrible culture. And you shouldn’t have to wait for a court to tell you.”

Mounting cases, mounting costs

A spike in lawsuits filed against individual officers began in 2020. In the five years before that, ADOC typically filed fewer than 20 claims per year to the General Liability Trust Fund, according to records provided by the Department of Finance. In 2020, the number of claims ticked up to 33, then 58 in 2021. In 2022, facing a surge of lawsuits against officers, ADOC filed 194 liability claims, and then filed 235 in 2023. Complete data for 2024 is not yet available.

That flood of lawsuits caused ADOC’s spending from the general liability trust fund to quadruple. Between 2015 and 2019, ADOC accounted for $2.9 million in legal expenses and settlement payments from the fund. In the following five years between 2020 and 2024, ADOC utilized $17.4 million from the General Liability Trust Fund, more than any other state department.
Legal expenses for the defense of officers named in the lawsuits amounted to double the amount of paid settlements. Between 2020 and 2024, payments to private attorneys who were hired to represent ADOC employees topped $12.9 million in that five year period, while indemnity, or settlement payments to plaintiffs, accounted for just $4.4 million. Plaintiffs alleging excessive force received a total of $1.7 million, with a median settlement of just $8,000.
These figures represent only a fraction of ADOC’s overall legal spending since 2020. Legal payments to outside attorneys and law firms for the department’s defense in class action cases amount to over $39.7 million, paid out of the state’s General Fund budget, according to records available in the Open Alabama checkbook database maintained by the Department of Finance. Combined with transactions from the state’s liability trust fund, ADOC has spent over $57 million on legal services since 2020. By comparison, the Alabama Attorney General Office’s General Fund budget this year is about $13.7 million.
“I think it’s fair to ask, how much is too much?” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a member of the state’s Joint Prison Oversight Committee and a frequent critic of prison conditions and ADOC spending. “It’s hard to imagine that we were intending to create a fund that just allows us to be in a perpetual state of lawsuits forever. When does the state of Alabama start demanding results from these lawsuits?”

How we reported “Blood Money”
When state employees are sued as individuals, Alabama’s General Liability Trust Fund is used to pay for their legal defense and any monetary settlement for the plaintiff. This use of the fund was the subject of our reporting, and records helped us identify 124 lawsuits against Alabama Department of Corrections employees that resulted in settlements between 2020 and 2024.

(Getty Images)Federal spending cuts proposed by President Donald Trump, including $33 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, would be devastating to Nevada, social services providers and local officials warn. 
“Prior to these proposed cuts, our social safety net was not overly strong,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County. Cuts planned by the administration will “reduce it to tatters.”
Trump’s budget requests are shaping legislation in the works by House Republicans that will slash Medicaid and food assistance programs in Trump’s “big beautiful bill” Congress is trying, with some difficulty, to pass. Assuming the bill makes it out of the House, Senate Republicans will attempt to pass it through the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to approve the bill with only a simple majority and circumvent Senate filibuster rules. 
The proposal would reduce HUD’s budget by more than 40% amid a national housing and homeless crisis.
Many social service agencies and nonprofits, including HELP of Southern Nevada, rely on federal funding to supplement their budget and provide needed services. 
HELP, one of the nonprofit organizations Clark County relies on to administer  homeless support programs, receives roughly $10 million of its $30 million budget from HUD, said Fuilala Riley, the CEO of HELP of Southern Nevada.
The nonprofit has been able to use federal dollars to fund permanent supportive housing, which is subsidized for populations with significantly low or no income, such as folks experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and comes with case management and wrap-around support services.
“This morning, 800 people woke up in a HELP of Southern Nevada program bed,” Riley said in an interview this month. “Half of those individuals are funded by federal funds.”
For every one person that asked for assistance to be connected to a program, “there’s probably 10 other ones that are out in the community,” who need help, she said. 
“The outlook is bleak because before we couldn’t answer all the requests,” Riley said. “Now we are facing a significant possibility that 30% of our funding will go away.”
The list of proposed cuts to HUD funding nationally includes a $532 million decrease in homeless assistance programs and a consolidation of several grants, like those provided by the federal Continuum of Care program that states use to address homelessness.
Clark County received about $21 million in funding from the Continuum of Care program in 2024 while Washoe County is allocated roughly $3.2 million.
Last year Clark County directed funding from the Continuum of Care program to support permanent supportive housing programs, rapid rehousing programs and transitional housing beds provided by the Clark County Social Service Dept. as well as nonprofits, including HELP of Southern Nevada, St. Jude’s Ranch for Children, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth and Safe Nest. 
Riley said HELP received about $7 million last fiscal year specifically from the Continuum of Care program. “There’s no way I can backstop $7 million in private funding on an ongoing basis” if she were to lose it or have it drastically reduced, she said. 
Peters said in Washoe County the majority of the funding is used by agencies to provide rental assistance and supportive services for people experiencing homelessness. 
The curtailment of vouchers for renters in particular “would have an absolutely devastating impact,” Peters said.
The federal budget proposed by Trump would also reduce the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which provides state and local governments with funding to expand the supply of housing, by $1.2 billion, and cut $196 million from  programs to help housing assistance recipients become more self-sufficient.
Clark County allocated about $9 million in HOME funds it received last year to “support the development or rehab 1,018 affordable housing units across the county.”  
Federal funding directed to nonprofits works in coordination with the resources they provide to create a fragile ecosystem. 
Organizations and providers get allocated federal funding and use it to address specific programs or problems in the community. 
If HELP, for example, doesn’t offer a particular resource or service, it will refer to another nonprofit that does. 
“When you start pulling out the blocks, it’s like playing Jenga,” Peters said. “Eventually it’s going to topple over. That’s a concern for all.”
Trump’s budget request would also slash public housing assistance such as Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8. 
While Washoe County isn’t the only entity that allocates housing vouchers, Peters said starting in 2021 the county received 137 emergency housing vouchers designed specifically to pay rent for people and families at risk or experiencing homelessness.
The program could also be at risk if the proposed cuts go through as currently written. 
“All the people in that program were previously experiencing homelessness,” Peters said. “The vast majority of those folks would return to homelessness if it were not for these voucher resources.”
‘Potential unraveling’ of the social safety net
Federal funding provided in pandemic relief legislation helped governments and nonprofits alike keep people housed, offer food assistance, and keep the safety net from collapsing. Now those funding streams are all but dried up. 
And even that funding could only go so far to stabilize people.
Rents across Nevada, as in much of the country, have skyrocketed and the state has a shortage of affordable and available housing. 
Combine increased rents with other rising costs of living, and “$12 and $14 an hour, that doesn’t cut it,” Riley said.
More than 10,100 people experienced homelessness in Nevada in 2024 – a 17% increase statewide – according to data released by HUD in December.
“If these proposed cuts go through, it’s going to be very difficult to sustain” the work that’s being done to help unhoused people, Peters said. “I think we’re going to see a huge influx in the number of people experiencing homelessness.”  
Close to a third of all state government spending in Nevada is made possible by federal funding.
“It takes all the revenue streams of public and private dollars to meet the needs of our community,” said Sam Rudd, President and CEO of United Way of Southern Nevada.
“It’s a very daunting reality.”
There are a lot of factors that make it “impossible to specifically state” the impact of federal cuts “without knowing what the final decisions are from the state support,” Rudd said in an interview. 
“Many times there are federal cuts that then get stopped or are in legal battles and there is a lot of unknown,” he said. 
While it might be hard to quantify the impact, there is no doubt that everyone in the community will feel the cuts. 
“A lot of people see a headline, read an article and think that doesn’t impact me,” Rudd said. “But it does impact this community and it will begin to create a potential unraveling of issues I don’t know we can quantify.” 
Nonprofits have already had some funding sources paused, including $1.2 million in Emergency Food and Shelter funds, which helps supplement various existing programs, Rudd said.
“That’s going to impact about 125,000 Clark County residents in that specific area,” he said. “They’ve already felt that impact. The funding was supposed to come through April … Not only are they not getting reimbursed for funds spent earlier this year, nonprofits have to put a hold on future expenditures” that would have been paid with that money.
While HELP has yet to suffer funding cuts directly, “we all understand the impact of the trickle effect of all these changes, including potential state challenges, and how the needs of our community are going to increase which will then trickle into other services,” Rudd said. 
The proposed federal cuts come amid projections of a slowing economy that prompted Nevada budget analysts to reduce the state’s revenue outlook over the next two fiscal years by  $191 million. 
Need for eviction assistance ‘is only going to get greater,’ state lawmaker warns

Along with federal funds, municipalities and nonprofits have relied on state funds to provide resources, including rental assistance to prevent evictions. 
State lawmakers allocated $18 million in rental assistance in 2023 to Clark County and Reno to help continue eviction diversion programs set up during the pandemic.
Assembly Bill 475 seeks to appropriate  $25 million in eviction diversion rental assistance funds — $18 million to Clark County and $7 million to Reno. 
It has yet to be voted on but has been declared exempt from legislative deadlines. 
“So many folks in our community have a broken down car or a major medical expense from not being able to make rent and being evicted,” Peters said. “Unfortunately most of those folks we see in our emergency shelter system and we would love to be able to provide more proactive solutions like providing rental assistance to keep people stably housed.”
Even if people don’t feel the impact of reduced state and federal funding that addresses homelessness, Riley said they’ll see it in the form of “an increase in the visibly unhoused.”
A cascade
Federal funding to support housing and homelessness programs works in concert with other types of non-housing related federal resources, Riley said. 
As examples, she pointed to weatherization and energy saving programs, which rely on federal funding, including from the Department of Energy. 
HELP will use those dollars to help extremely low income seniors or households with children to modernize or fix homes to make them more energy efficient. Riley said it is a far less costly practice than moving households to places that are more energy efficient. 
“If they lose their home, (seniors) are not going to be able to afford the market rate,” she said. “Then comes hundreds of households a year that are going to be affected. Weatherization is no longer just an energy conversation, it’s a prevention”
The proposed cuts to Medicaid could also have a sizable impact on people receiving housing and homeless assistance, Peters said. 
“Many of the folks we serve are able to access medical, behavioral health and mental health services through Medicaid coverage,” she said. “If that is reduced, folks can’t obtain that care, which is critical.”
For people receiving housing assistance, help to weatherize homes to be more energy efficient, and food assistance, they could face yet another blow to their fragile support system if they are also kicked off Medicaid, Riley said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For decades, our elected leadership at both the legislative and executive levels have neglected to look ahead and find ways to cement a sustainable future for Alaskans.  Instead of working to establish and secure new revenue streams, we married ourselves to oil and mining companies that inexplicably continue to receive massive tax cuts, even as the returns of their industries decline.   Instead of standing on issues like good schools, quality roads, and affordable energy, political debates are instead hogged by questions about how big of a Permanent Fund dividend one can expect.  
In the sphere of Alaska’s public education, this has all culminated in a way that is nothing short of a crisis.  The state has not significantly increased the per-student dollar amount that goes to education since 2012, even though inflation has risen a whopping 40% since then.  Make no mistake, flat funding in an era of 40% inflation is in fact a cut of 40%.  Is it really so surprising that our declining test scores have mirrored that?  
All the while, the state shuffles between excuses, claiming we can’t afford to spend more on education (lack of revenue); blaming so-called “special interest groups” (otherwise known as parents, and the teachers who spend 40 hours a week with your children); and insisting that more charter schools will solve all our problems.  
Charters in Alaska are a wholly unsustainable model that is not expandable in any way, shape or form.  To be clear, instead of addressing the declining enrollment and financial exigency that has led school districts across the state to shutter and consolidate neighborhood schools, the governor is literally proposing we open more schools.  He has advocated making the application process easier and having the state take over the approval process, even though it’s the local school district that would have to foot the bill in their budget.  We can’t even afford to run the schools we have.  We can’t open more.  
What’s more, it is imperative that Alaskans understand that every charter school is subsidized by hundreds and hundreds of hours of volunteer work — unpaid work donated by willing families.  Charter schools in Alaska are public schools of choice, not neighborhood schools, meaning their enrollment is done by lottery.  Families are often required to attend an information night and are asked to sign a document indicating they understand the special commitments associated with attending a charter before they are permitted to even enter the lottery.   Those commitments include student transportation (not a single charter in the state is able to offer busing); supplying food (many charter buildings do not have kitchens and do not operate a food program for breakfast or lunch, and some are able to offer only cold lunch options); and volunteer hour quotas.  Many charters do not have school nurses, PE teachers, libraries or librarians, music teachers, or counselors.  Every family is expected to contribute significant time, labor, and/or money to the school to fill in the gaps.
On no planet is this a sustainable model. This magnitude of commitment is not possible for many, many families.  Advocating for more charters is not a way forward; instead, it is the foremost example of the short-sighted leadership that has led Alaska down this devastating path.  Public education is not supposed to be a caste system.  
The governor is fond of claiming that charters are unilaterally responsible for superior academic performance.  This is a spurious connection.  Certain legislators are fond of impassioned speeches urging Alaska to prioritize charters because their constituents demand it.  That does not legitimize continuing to grow an inequitable system.  
What constituents are really demanding is a better education and better experience for their kids.  Sadly, the last few decades of underfunding have taught us that such an experience may only be attainable through enrollment at a charter school.  Charters are like splinter cells, able to write completely well-intentioned education philosophy into their Magna Carta, allowing them to prioritize small student bodies, low student-to-teacher ratio, alternative learning models that can suit different learners, and immersion into things like place-based learning, the arts, or languages.  Our neighborhood schools don’t get to do that, because they can’t afford it.  That’s not a reason to put more kids into charters.  That’s a reason to demand our government do better.  
You cannot blame parents and families.  The short-sighted solution from the macro perspective is not short at all when you’re on the ground as the parent of school-aged kids: that “short” time is your kid’s whole school career.  As a friend recently observed, you can’t begrudge people for simply utilizing an option that was made available to them at the time.  You can’t blame families for choosing what was best for their kids and sinking their hours into small schools of choice instead of lobbying for state-level structural changes that might take years, and generations of politicians, to come to fruition.  Those improvements might be altogether too late.  
The thing is, it was not the responsibility of families to “zoom out” and understand the complexities at hand in the fight for quality education for all kids — that was on our lawmakers.  In our current landscape, charters are seemingly the only option parents have to make a better educational experience for their kids, so you can’t blame them for saying they want it.  That’s the kind of short-sightedness you’re entitled to when you suddenly realize you don’t want your 5-year-old going into a kindergarten class of 28 kids.  One can, however, blame the state for enabling only that one choice — especially since it’s not actually a choice for so many.  We can demand they do better.
Thank you to Sen. Löki Tobin, Rep. Rebecca Himschoot and the other sitting and past legislators who have been education advocates. Now it’s time for the rest of our elected leaders to pull up their bootstraps, look ahead, and get to the work of restoring public education so that it benefits all of Alaska’s kids — not just the ones fortunate enough to attend charters.

Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. When he was 14, a teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up and he answered that he wanted to be a lawyer. The teacher chided him, urging him to be realistic. “Why don’t you plan on carpentry?” 
In prison, he became a follower of Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. In his speeches, Malcolm X warned Black Americans against self-loathing: “Who taught you to hate the texture of your hair? Who taught you to hate the color of your skin? Who taught you to hate the shape of your nose and the shape of your lips? Who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet? Who taught you to hate your own kind?” 
Prior to a 1964 pilgrimage to Mecca, he split with Elijah Muhammad. As a result of that trip, Malcolm X began to accept followers of all races. In 1965, he was assassinated. Denzel Washington was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the civil rights leader in Spike Lee’s 1992 award-winning film.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06124948/Feb21-MalcolmX-featured.webp,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

Dear incoming student,
Welcome to the University of Alabama! We’re delighted that you’re joining our community of over 40,000 students. We hope your time here will allow you to grow personally and academically.
Moving to a new campus can be stressful. Here are some ways you can make the journey easier.
– Pack light. Take only what you need. Don’t bring groceries or other food; you can pick that up in one of Tuscaloosa’s supermarkets.
– Plan ahead. Talk to your roommates ahead of time to decide who will bring big items to be shared by all, like televisions or criminal attorneys.
– Label boxes. Moving can feel chaotic. Be sure you can track your packages should a law enforcement officer confiscate them.
Here are some items we recommend bringing:

Appropriate clothing – it gets hot here in August!
Academic supplies (pens, notebooks, legal pads, etc.)
Bedding (pillows, sheets, blankets)
Clothing for court (we recommend business attire in neutral tones)
Desk lamp, desk organizer
File cabinet
PACER subscription
Predrafted habeas corpus brief
Towels

One note: hanging items on your walls inappropriately could lead to a damage charge. Please consult the management of your dormitory or apartment building on the best way to display your citizenship or residency papers.
Campus life
Your time at Alabama will lead to friendships that last a lifetime and memories you’ll always cherish. And they’ll be your own, whether it’s cheering for the Crimson Tide at Bryant-Denny Stadium or getting accosted by a man in a balaclava claiming to be a federal official.
UA prides itself on the range of activities it offers students. Get On Board Day showcases all of our wonderful student organizations. Be sure to check it out! We’re working hard to create spaces where students engage in stilted conversations and worry nonstop that one of their colleagues is an informant.
And don’t forget Alabama’s latest, proudest tradition, the PreDawn Knock. Are you one of our 1,200 international students? Maybe you’ll get to frantically call your attorney as Immigration and Customs Enforcement breaks down your door.
(We do not recommend calling administration or general counsel if you find yourself in jail. It is the University of Alabama’s policy to be indifferent to our students’ safety.)
Academics 
With over 200 major or minor subjects to study, you’re certain to find something to match your academic interests. Take special note of our criminology classes. UA offers an unparalleled opportunity to see the nation’s law enforcement seize students on thin pretexts.
For parents
Watching your child leave for college can be an emotional experience. Perhaps you’re worried about how they’ll adjust to a new environment, or if they’ll be shipped without warning to an out-of-state prison. These are normal concerns for any new Alabama student. False imprisonment is one of the many experiences we offer our students.
Questions?
If you have any questions about classes, your dorms or why you’re putting your life in our hands, don’t hesitate to ask. We have staff available 24/7 to give you no comment.
Welcome to Alabama! We’re glad you’re here. And don’t step out of line.

In the case of one bike safety bill, killed on Friday, the arbitrary deadline will cost more lives on our roads and discourage cycling for years. 
What is the point of the arbitrary deadline and what are its impacts? Some say it is about efficiency. 
But when we dig down, it’s extremely inefficient and contributes to ill-informed decision-making on the part of legislators, leaving Nevada in the dark ages, unable to make real progress.
Assembly Bill 168 flew through the Assembly nearly unopposed. It allows cyclists to go through stop signs and stop lights if there are no other cars. We call it Stop-As-Yield and you can learn about it and how it’s working in other states in this video. 
The bill had the backing of local transportation officials, federal experts at the Highway Administration, and even the Governor’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Board. Police agencies testified in neutral, not opposed. Why? Forty years of data in other states shows that these same safety measures save lives immediately once enacted. 
The bill would not have even cost taxpayers any money.
But Friday, AB168 hit a roadblock for no reason — or at least no readily identifiable reason — other than Nevada’s arbitrary legislative time limits. Bills had to make it out of the “second house” committee by Friday, or die.
AB168 had sailed through its “first house,” passing on the Assembly floor by vote of 41 to 1.
It died at the hands of one person. The chair of each committee has the power to forward bills to the full Senate and Assembly. But they had to do it by Friday. Democratic Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, chair of the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, was in that hot seat on Friday, facing a deadline with lots of bill sponsors like us struggling to meet with her to try to get past the deadline. But, she said she would not let the bike bill move forward because she has an unspecified “concern.” She has offered no additional explanation despite repeated requests. 
Because of Nevada’s arbitrary 120 day deadline, there is no opportunity to meet with Nguyen or educate her to address her concern, whatever it is. In the 120 day session, her committee had an average of only 2 days to consider each of the 52 bills in front of them. The Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee passed 75% of its bills, half of which they waited until the last week to act on. Ten of their bills weren’t even heard, including one from the Nevada Highway Patrol, S.B. 38, that would have prohibited and penalized road rage in Nevada. That’s something cyclists experience on the road every day and we will now need to continue to endure it because the committee failed to act on that bill which was backed by law enforcement.
These are no-brainer bills but they don’t make it past committee because of these arbitrary deadlines.
Law enforcement and bike advocates will now need to wait another two years before trying again on road rage and our Stop-As-Yield bike bill. We will go through the process all over – volunteering countless hours of time, energy and money with the possibility of unceremoniously being whacked by one committee chair who is running up against an arbitrary deadline and doesn’t have time to thoroughly consider the facts. This is extremely discouraging. 
If good policy that is backed by public safety experts, works in other states, modernizes our roads, saves lives and punishes violent criminals doesn’t make it over the finish line in the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, it makes me wonder what are the common factors that do get a bill over the tight finish line.
For instance, AB 527 barely made it over the finish line at the last minute in the committee. It authorizes cameras to be installed on school buses to catch drivers who blast through school bus stop signs. The video of drivers almost killing children is alarming. That’s not the kind of bill that should have to wait years either, let alone until the last minute to pass because of arbitrary deadlines. Maybe a common factor that contributes to passage of bills is alarming and sensational video that grabs legislator’s attention and is an easy sell. 
Here is another common factor in bills that pass and it points to another serious problem posed by Nevada’s arbitrary deadline. Similar to the bike bill, AB 527 is already working in other states to save lives according to the proponents. Because of their time crunch, Nevada legislators are more likely to just pass things that are already working in other states, but they take a lot longer to do it and ask a lot of questions as if the bill is a novel idea or they ask no questions at all, like they did with the bike bill. Since they spend their time on bills that already work in other states, they are less likely to innovate and come up with laws specific to Nevada.
If they had more time, they would not only pass the laws that are already working to protect residents in other states but they would probably come up with great new and innovative laws for Nevadans. Legislators are sharp, well educated and probably want more time too.
With more time for lawmakers to research, Nevada could make leaps on many levels, not just transportation. But because of the arbitrary deadlines, legislators are killing bills without regard for facts or what their own local experts say. They don’t even have time to explain to their constituents.
Most bill proponents don’t speak out about this, for fear of retribution – that legislators will kill their bills just because they spoke out. It’s time to seriously ask ourselves if arbitrary deadlines are worth the consequences. Now the consequences mean years of more unnecessary deaths on our roads.
I am confident that the Stop-As-Yield bill would have been ultimately signed by the governor. Over the years thousands of good policy bills have likely died this way, never to be visited again. The result is that Nevada is at or near the top of nearly every bad list in the nation, clawing its way at the bottom behind every other state. 
It’s not just bills that died on Friday. Hope for change on our roads died.
The solution is simple: longer and more frequent legislative sessions so that we pass important bills and catch up with the rest of the nation.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764

“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added. 
Jackson is the fourth Democrat to join the race. He will face Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Kenneth Pinet and Angus King III, the son of independent senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month. 
The Allagash-native said he is running for governor to help not only working families and seniors, but also to build a Maine where the children raised here can afford to stay. During his time as a legislator, Jackson focused on lowering prescription drug costs, passing universal school meals, as well as securing funding for rural hospitals and veterans’ homes. He termed out last year. 
Jackson is kicking off his campaign with a statewide tour from Kittery to Madawaska. It starts Monday with a rally at the Kittery Town Wharf followed by a tour of Auburn Manufacturing, Inc. and the Lockwood Mill in Waterville.

Ivey on Thursday signed HB 202 a controversial bill sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, that provides law enforcement with enhanced immunity protections.
“I was very proud to have two former law enforcement agents sponsoring this important bill in the House and the Senate,” Ivey said in a news release regarding the legislation. “Rep. Rex Reynolds, a former police chief in Huntsville, and Sen. Lance Bell, a former deputy sheriff in St. Clair County, both did an excellent job moving the bill through the legislative process.”
Despite support from Ivey and leadership in the chambers, the bill faced significant opposition from Democrats and civil rights groups, who expressed fears the bill would allow law enforcement to act with impunity. In the final Senate debate over the measure on Wednesday, several Black Democrats discussed encounters with law enforcement, the dangers Black Americans often encounter in them and the warnings they give to their children during those encounters.
“Somebody will look at my baby, and because he’s six-foot, dreads in his hair — they won’t see an honor student,” said Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove. “I can serve here now because my son helps with my father, who is a disabled vet. But there’s somebody that will look at my baby and will decide he is a threat. This bill opens the door for more, not only my baby, but other babies to be at risk in the state of Alabama.”

The bill was amended through the process and only received final approval in the last hour of the 2025 regular session Wednesday evening.
Bills in the package focused on punishment and incarceration, from enhancing Aniah’s Law that creates additional obstacles. Reynolds and other supporters of the immunity bill also argued the measures were needed to improve law enforcement recruitment in the state. Many big city departments, like Birmingham and Montgomery, have reported shortages of staff.
Other bills included in the package enhanced penalties for people charged with crimes that involve firearms, allow agencies to revoke parole and electronically monitor people released from incarceration, as well as make it more difficult to release juveniles after arrest.
Some bills in the package received bipartisan support, including one that criminalized converting semiautomatic pistols into fully automatic weapons.

SB 115: This bill would broaden the existing crime of “impersonating a peace officer” to include individuals who accept employment as a peace officer while knowing they are ineligible to serve or knowing that their Alabama Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission certification has been revoked or suspended.


SB 119: This bill would expand the current “certain persons forbidden” law to include individuals with any prior felony conviction unless they have had their gun rights restored by pardon. It expands Aniah’s Law and increases the penalty for shooting into an occupied dwelling, vehicle or other designated space from a Class B felony to a Class A felony. It requires the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to revoke parole, or a court to revoke probation, when a parolee or probationer has been convicted of unlawful firearm possession and revokes probation or parole when the parolee or probationer is found in possession of a firearm by his or her parole or probation officer.


SB 116: This bill would make it a Class C felony for a person to knowingly possess a “Glock Switch”— a part or combination of parts designed to convert a pistol into a fully automatic machine gun.


HB 199: This bill clarifies that the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, or any other state agency, can provide electronic monitoring services to children released by a juvenile court pending disposition of their case, and repeals the 72-hour limitation on confinement of juvenile status offenders who have violated a valid court order.

Democrats fully supported the Glock switch bill, which Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, had brought in prior sessions.
“As we always do, we are going to stand up for what we believe in and work in a bipartisan way, but then, when there are things that we oppose, like the immunity bill, we are going to fight back on those,” Ensler said in an interview on Wednesday.
Ensler opted to view the package as separate bills instead of one large package that was a compendium of several pieces of legislation.
“Look, I would say in general though, between the Glock Switch bill, between those other restrictions on who can access firearms, and then the ankle monitors … there were some good things that came out of it,” he said.
One bill that did not pass was HB 188, sponsored by Rep. Alan Treadaway, R-Morris, to provide scholarships for law enforcement dependents to attend post-secondary education institutions. The legislation won approval from the House in February and got Senate committee approval just over a week later, but did not come to the floor for a vote.
Immunity

HB 202 enhances the standard by which law enforcement may claim immunity from any wrongdoing from actions while performed on duty. Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, managed to add reporting requirements to the bill, but the core of the legislation remains largely intact.
Reynolds said in an interview Friday that the legislation “clarifies a 30-year piece of legislation and allows for ‘pause and review’ within 45 days so that a Judge of jurisdiction can review and determine if they in fact have immunity under this law.”
Civil rights groups remain skeptical that the legislation will enhance public safety. Jerome Dees, policy director at the Southern Poverty Law Center likened the legislation to the federal crime legislation that former President Bill Clinton sponsored in the 1990s that was supported by Republicans and eventually passed into law.
“I think after 30 years’ worth of data and multiple Democratic administrations, those policies, those tactics, are not what actually moves the needle on public safety,” Dees said. “What does work are things like the accountability courts, occupational licensure, that crime is often driven by economic opportunity for folks. What I would have liked to have seen from the administration and the Legislature is a greater focus on creating pathways and opportunities for individuals that they may see as at risk.”
A’Niya Robinson, policy director for ACLU of Alabama, said she had questions about creating additional immunity protections for a class of individuals because of their professions.
“There is also a lot of references in the bill to an officer’s ‘discretionary authority,’ and for us, that is very subjective, and of course it varies from officer to officer because part of it is based on their interpretation of the law, which can differ from person to person,” she said.
She added that she was encouraged that the legislation included provisions for reporting, adding that it was an important bill in the package and one that only one that the ACLU of Alabama had been tracking.
“I think part of it is that it touches on so many things that matter to us all, as well as so many topics that have been in the news for the past couple of years,” she said. “There have been a lot of law enforcement-involved shootings in the past couple of years, not just across the country but right here in Alabama. And that hits home for a lot of folks in this state. I think there are a lot of concerns with how law enforcement interacts with Black folks but other communities in this state, for example LGBTQ+ folks, people who have disabilities, and even folks who are in the media.”
During debate over the bill on Wednesday, Democrats in both chambers said they wanted to support police officers who exercise restraint, and said they knew what happened if they did not.
“There’s a reason that we are the ones speaking on this side of the aisle about this bill,” said Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery. “Far too often, we are the victims of it.”

(Photo by FatCamera/Getty stock photo)Maryland is slightly ahead of most states when it comes to supporting maternal mental health, but other states have been gaining ground in the last year while Maryland has been static, according to an analysis that assesses states on a A-F grading scale.
The 2025 Maternal Mental Health State Report Card, released Thursday, gave Maryland a ‘C’ this year, pushing the state just ahead of the national average score of a C-.
But health advocates note that 26 other states boosted their “grades” over last year’s report card, and say Maryland needs to increase mental health screening efforts to help improve its score for next year’s report card.
“Maryland has a lot to be proud of in terms of its grade. It is performing better than most states on maternal mental health policies,” said Caitlin Murphy, one of the researchers who worked on the report. “Maryland is doing better than the national average, which is great … There’s a few key areas where Maryland could continue to improve.”
The Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health released its third annual report Thursday to update grades on states’ accessibility to maternal mental health services.
“The good news is that the U.S. national grade has improved slightly from a D+ to a C- … We’re also seeing 26 state grades improving this year alone, with five state’s earning B’s,” Murphy said. “We know there’s still a lot more work to be done on 19 states that are still earning D or F grades.”
This year, five states received B grades, 27 states received C grades, 17 states received D grades and 2 states received F’s. That’s an improvement from last year, when 24 states received D grades and 5 states receiving failing grades.
“Folks are realizing just how crucial it is to address this. And not only to destigmatize maternal mental health, but really put the policies in place at the state level and the health insurance level to get … all the things we know are needed to support mental health for moms,” Murphy said.
Report: Md. shows ‘incremental’ gains on maternal mental health, but still needs work

“Folks are very aware of postpartum depression, but this also includes postpartum anxiety, OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), psychosis – which is much rarer. But, there is starting to be more understanding around that,” she said.
The report focuses on several areas where states can improve maternal mental health access to services and health care coverage across the states. Some metrics considered include Medicaid coverage, access to maternal mental health providers, and data from insurance coverage and claims for services.
One category assesses whether Medicaid requires screenings and data collection for mental health concerns such as prenatal depression and post-partum depression. Last year’s report card docked Maryland over not requiring data collection on mental health screening – an area that Maryland lost points on again this year.
“States can require their health plans to report on rates of maternal mental health screening,” Murphy said. “Right now, Maryland does not require its health plans, and in particular its Medicaid health plans, to report on rates of maternal mental health screening.”
Dan Martin, senior director of public policy for the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said that the report card shows “that there is room to improve in Maryland,” including in screening for maternal mental health needs.
“Screening and identification for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders really improves the likelihood for recovery of the mother. It supports healthy childhood development,” he said. “It (maternal mental health) can have profound impacts on the health of the mother and her infant and her family.”
That doesn’t mean that those screenings are not happening, Murphy noted, just that the state doesn’t require collection of that data, which can make tracking statewide progress difficult.
“The more health plans that are reporting out the screening rates, the better idea we’re able to have of if it’s actually happening – and that’s one of the biggest gaps right now in terms of data,” she said. “We don’t know yet if maternal mental health disorders are reducing, and part of that is the need for screening to be more universal and for screening to be required, so we can actually track this over time.”

The Maryland Department of Health said in a written statement Thursday that the state is “committed to all women in Maryland achieving and maintaining their highest level of physical, mental, and emotional health and well-being.”
The policy center added new metrics this year that measured whether states invested in group prenatal care for the Medicaid populations. Murphy said such programs help connect pregnant people and new mothers to peers and social supports.
Maryland earned a few extra points for programs such as the Medicaid CenteringPregnancy Program, which brings people with a similar due date together to will learn about what to expect during pregnancy as a community.
But it was not enough to boost the state’s grade to a C+, Murphy said.
She noted that Maryland is ahead of other states when it comes to health care coverage for pregnancy through Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program targeted for lower-income families and other specific populations.
But with members of Congress deliberating significant cuts to Medicaid, Murphy worries that states will backslide on progress made over the last few years.
State officials, advocates fear impact of expected Medicaid cuts in House bill

“Even though states are making this incremental progress on maternal mental health, we also know that right now Congress is putting forward proposed policies to cut Medicaid and Health and Human Services programs,” she said. “If those kinds of cuts go through, we are going to see state scores and the overall national score backslide.”
KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization, reports that in 2023, 41% of births in the United States were financed by Medicaid. In Maryland, about 42% of births were supported by Medicaid coverage that year.
“That statistic is often surprising to folks, but it reflects the fact that this is a really important source of coverage,” Murphy said.
She said that interest in maternal mental health has been increasing over the last few years and hopes that increased awareness of the issue will help deter Congress from cutting supports for maternal mental health services.
“It’s been wonderful that over the past several years, I think people have started to understand the depths of how important maternal mental health is and also how far we have to go,” Murphy said. “This is a real failure of our health care systems to support our moms and families … It’s really a matter of life or death.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2156120290-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The crisis inside the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) has generated extensive reporting on escalating prison violence and deaths, the proliferation of contraband drugs, and squalid conditions inside overcrowded and understaffed facilities. These factors led the U.S. Department of Justice to conclude Alabama prison conditions violate prisoners’ Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, leading to a lawsuit in 2020.
Since then, the state of Alabama has spent over $39 million defending ADOC in a handful of complex lawsuits, including the one filed by the DOJ. But these cases represent only a fraction of litigation involving ADOC.
During the last decade, an increasing number of individual civil rights lawsuits have been filed against correctional officers and prison administrators over wrongful deaths, failure to protect from violence and excessive force. Unlike the DOJ lawsuit or other large class-action lawsuits, individual lawsuits filed by incarcerated people or their families receive little attention or oversight.
These individual lawsuits were the focus of the reporting for this series. We wanted  to figure out just how many lawsuits were being litigated against employees of ADOC every year, and learn more about the nature of the lawsuits, the outcomes, and the cost to taxpayers. Just how much public money was ADOC spending on these lawsuits, not just in settlements to plaintiffs, but paying private lawyers to defend sued officers? And beyond settlement payments, was any systemic change resulting from these lawsuits?
First, we had to recognize an important distinction in how Alabama pays for legal services. When an entire state agency is named in a lawsuit, like in the DOJ’s lawsuit against ADOC, legal services are paid for out of Alabama’s General Fund budget. But when state employees are sued as individuals, the General Liability Trust Fund (GLTF) is used to pay for their legal defense and any monetary settlement for the plaintiff. This use of the GLTF was the subject of our reporting.
We filed an open records request with Alabama’s Department of Finance, asking for a spreadsheet of records connected to all transactions out of the GLTF, as well as total yearly use of the fund by ADOC dating back to 2013. In the spreadsheet, transactions were categorized as either legal expenses or indemnity payments, also known as settlement payments. The transaction records included corresponding case names and numbers, which allowed us to connect each transaction to specific lawsuits. We then located the lawsuits in federal court records, and through reviewing the records, were able to pinpoint lawsuits involving ADOC employees. This is how we identified the 124 lawsuits against ADOC employees that resulted in settlements between 2020-2024.
The 124 lawsuits ending in settlement in this five-year period gave us a fixed group of cases to study, not only to help identify issues and trends in the allegations, but also in the amount of time and money spent on the litigation. Through this project, we aimed to increase transparency and accountability regarding ADOC’s increasing use of public resources and taxpayer dollars. And in an effort to deepen our understanding of the crisis inside Alabama prisons, we also wanted to report on the lawsuits themselves, and the human beings involved, to lessen the abstractions of incarceration and illuminate what would otherwise remain unseen, unheard and unknown.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Barbed-wire-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764

Reservations will begin with Greenbrier and Sandy Point state parks.","Visitors take in Greenbrier State Park in Washington County during an event called ""Es Mi Parque"" in 2019. (Photo Courtesy of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources)At Greenbrier State Park in Western Maryland, the line of cars sometimes started forming as early as midnight, with visitors desperate to secure a coveted spot beside the park’s popular lake after the sun came up.
On the busiest days, the line could stretch a few miles from the park entrance as more and more cars arrived, said Tim Hamilton of the Maryland Park Service. The resulting traffic is just one of the reasons why the park service will begin requiring advance reservations from all Greenbrier visitors on weekends and holidays from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Hamilton said.
The reservation website rolls out Monday, and reservations will be required starting next weekend for the Memorial Day weekend — both at Greenbrier and Sandy Point State Park, which hosts a popular swimming beach on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Anne Arundel County.
Some time later this summer, the reservation requirement will expand to include Point Lookout, Newtowne Neck and North Point State Parks.
Hamilton starts the story in 2019, when there were 14.9 million visitors to Maryland state parks, which “shattered” all previous records. But another storm was coming.
The coronavirus pandemic brought Marylanders outdoors in droves, and park visitorship skyrocketed to 21.5 million: a staggering 45% increase over 2019. That year, 14 of the state’s 75 state parks had to close 292 times during peak season because they had reached full capacity.
A limited staff of park rangers was forced to contend with the crowds and manage traffic, pulling them away from other duties, Hamilton said.
“This is a safety issue,” said Hamilton, the business and marketing manager for the park service. “People get lost in the woods, children go missing by a lake — and every second counts.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The high visitorship wasn’t just a one-year blip. In 2021, the visitorship dipped slightly. But at 20.6 million, it still blew every other year but 2020 out of the water.
“Once we were discovered, we stayed discovered,” Hamilton said.
The idea of a mandatory reservation system isn’t without precedent in Maryland. In 2019, the park service debuted a reservation system for entry to the Falling Branch area of Rocks State Park in Harford County, home to 17-foot high Kilgore Falls, which is Maryland’s second-highest vertical drop waterfall. The falls’ popularity would quickly overwhelm its 28-space parking lot, Hamilton said.
“For a couple weeks, people grumbled,” Hamilton said. “After they got a hang of it, it went swimmingly.”
Park managers got to thinking: Could the reservation system be scaled up?
“We knew we had to do something,” Hamilton said.
Vendor Kaizen Labs developed a website that goes live May 19, where prospective weekend visitors can vie for open slots at Greenbrier and Sandy Point, and pay park entry fees. The first day registration is required is Saturday, May 24.
There’s been at least some grumbling on social media since the park service announced the reservation system earlier this month, Hamilton said.
“They said: ‘Well we already paid for these public lands and now were being told that they’re limited?’” Hamilton said. “What do you do? We don’t want someone waiting there from 3 a.m. on.”
Upon registration, guests will receive a QR code that will be scanned at the park entrance. Park staff will verify the number of people entering the park and assess any additional fees. Visitors without the registration code will be turned away.
Reservations can be made up to seven days in advance, and can be edited or canceled until 8 a.m. the day before the visit.
As of now, there aren’t any plans to expand the reservation system beyond the initial five parks, Hamilton said, even though other parks experience closures during peak season, such as various areas of Patapsco State Park. The focus is on the parks with the most serious visitation woes, he said.
“We want to alleviate problems that we have. We don’t want to create a process where we don’t need to,” Hamilton said.
At both Greenbrier and Sandy Point, signs advertising the reservation requirement went up this week, and park staff members have been handing out flyers to visitors as well. They’re hoping the public information blast, which is also hitting email list subscribers, will ease the transition to reservations.
“For the first few weeks there are going to be some rough edges we have to knock off,” Hamilton said. “But in the end it’s going to be a much better experience for everybody.”
At Greenbrier, the state also just finished a repaving project meant to widen the entry road leading into the park, Hamilton said.
In the end, state officials are hoping the reservation effort eases stress for park staff members, and slows the impact on the state’s delicate natural lands.

Booker Jr. | Opinion Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/the-immigration-debate-endangers-the-psychological-safety-of-our-kids/,"Students in our schools worry about parents being deported because of their immigration status, making it hard for them to learn and thrive.","The other day, I was walking through a school and overheard a student say to a classmate, “Shut up, before I have to call ICE on you.” 
You hear murmurs about what’s going on in schools across our nation. But I heard this negative comment in a school in Connecticut. It shows just how much these types of antics and negative behavior have become the norm in our society under the current administration. These types of comments make people feel unwelcome and unsafe.
Some students in our schools have to worry about their parents or family members being deported because of their immigration status. Even families who have been brought to the United States legally through asylum or refugee resettlement programs live with threats that they do not belong. So, how do we ensure that our students feel safe?  


Psychological safety is the feeling that one is safe to share ideas, take risks, and make mistakes without fear of judgment or negative consequences. This kind of safety is found on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. The most basic needs we have physiological (which include air, water, food, shelter, sleep, and clothing), but the very next step on the hierarchy is safety (which includes personal security, health, and stability). Psychological safety is a critical need that every human needs to access and engage with the rest of the world.
Students who do not feel psychologically safe cannot effectively engage in learning. They will have difficulty concentrating, poor memory retention, lower academic performance, and increased absenteeism or school avoidance 

Kevin L. Booker, Jr.
The hate speech in our country toward immigration has existed at some level for many years. But with the current administration, people have been given greater permission to freely share their personal opinions, as the person in the highest seat of leadership in this country publicly shares such negative beliefs towards immigrants and refugees.
For many refugees and immigrants who have come to the U.S. legally, this type of talk has sparked fear.  People in their community feel emboldened to shout threats and racist terms at them, tell them to “go back to where they came from,” and express other similar hate-filled sentiments like the threat of ICE action I heard at school.
Recently, President Trump announced that any immigrant can choose to “self-deport,” and the federal government will give them $1,000.  
As a result, individuals who came to the United States legally through the CBP app received a message that it is now time for them to return to their country. The CBP app was a temporarily legal way for people to enter the United States instead of crossing the border illegally, established during President Biden’s administration. 
Additionally, the fear tactics of sending individuals to a Venezuelan prison, talking about wanting to reopen Alcatraz, filling immigrant detention facilities, and highly publicized arrests and deportations of young people have created a very unsafe environment for many of our students and their families.
The fear felt by families in Connecticut has increased since Trump’s first term in office.  Sabrina Tavi, the director of Immigrant Children’s Justice Project, recently shared, “There is significant fear in our communities that’s impacting kids attending school and resulting in families not feeling comfortable sending them to school.” The fearmongering that this administration is conducting is having a significant impact on the young people in our state.
Recently, I had the opportunity to interview two educators in Connecticut who talked about the impact the current social and political environment has on their students and families. 
Wakime Hauser, a middle school special education teacher, says that the media contributes to the fear and false information that others have about immigration. 
Hauser said that in order to feel more equipped to support his students and their families, it is critical that they are provided with accurate and reliable information. He mentioned that it is also essential that people understand the immigration laws and why they were established. He shared that the amount of misinformation in the media – and promoted by the federal administration – greatly impacts everyone’s viewpoint.
One way his school community responded to the political climate was by giving a presentation to the staff about ICE, what it is, and what the Connecticut Law states around immigration. They also outlined what steps would be taken at the school if an ICE agent came to the school.
Dr. Lamirra Hood-Stewart, an educator and former principal, shared that the fear children who are undocumented have is something that no child should have to deal with. She stated that it is critical for schools to create spaces where students feel psychologically safe. Dr. Hood-Stewart described that students are watching the news, they are having conversations with their families about the possibility of deportation, and they are fearful. 
“So, if you don’t feel psychologically safe, how does a teacher say, open up your book to page 5, when in your mind you are worried about all this other stuff?” Dr. Hood-Stewart said.
Dr. Hood-Stewart emphasized how important it is for school communities to support their students. 
“With all of this going on, [families] do not know who to trust…They need that sense of security to know that they are safe,” she said. “The focus should be helping [students] develop into young adults who become contributing members of society.” 
The current political and social climate surrounding immigration has created a profoundly unsettling environment for many students and their families, especially refugees, asylum seekers, or undocumented immigrants. Fear and insecurity are now common realities in many communities, including those right here in Connecticut. This fear directly threatens students’ ability to learn, thrive, and feel like valued members of their school communities. Psychological safety, a basic human need, is essential for academic engagement and personal development. 
It is the responsibility of educators, school leaders, and policymakers to ensure that schools remain safe havens where all students, regardless of immigration status, feel secure, respected, and supported. Let’s continue coming together in our communities and throughout the state to ensure that educators and families have the tools to make their school spaces where every child can flourish.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-19 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about the public benefits charge on your electric bill,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/ct-public-benefits-charge/,"The public benefits charge has drawn the public's ire due to the debate over CT's electric prices, which are among the highest in the nation.","If you’ve taken a detailed look at your Connecticut electric bill over the last year or so, you probably noticed that it’s broken down into four sections: supply, transmission, local delivery and — to the confusion and ire of many — a section labeled “public benefits.” 
While the first three charges represent the cost to purchase and distribute electricity that customers expect out of their utility company, the last charge is less familiar to many even though it has existed in some form for over two decades.
The charge’s existence has become more widely known due to the recent debate about Connecticut’s electric prices, which are some of the highest in the country.
As of the most recent changes to electric rates that took effect May 1, public benefits charges account for roughly 20% of the typical Eversource customer’s bill. For United Illuminating customers, it is just over 18% of the overall bill.
What’s in the charge?
Simply put, the public benefits charge is a collection of state and federally-mandated initiatives that include energy efficiency and electrification programs, assistance for low-income customers and contracts to purchase power from specific sources, such as nuclear power plants. It also includes costs associated with the operations of ISO-New England, the nonprofit charged with overseeing the regional grid.
The price tag for each of those programs are paid by the utilities, who then pass along the costs to their customers through the public benefits charge.


The charts above show the relative costs for all the various components of the public benefits charge in 2024. Current rates are determined both by last year’s costs and estimates for 2025.
The process for determining how much each customer of the state’s two investor-owned utilities must pay for those charges is more complex.
Public benefits charges are assessed a per-kilowatt-hour rate, meaning a customer will end up paying more as they use more electricity.
Each spring, the companies make a filing with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority showing what their actual costs were to offer previous year’s slate of programs, along with their estimates for what those programs will cost in the upcoming year. The rate, which must be approved by regulators, is calculated using those estimates along with any overcollection or undercollection of costs from the previous year.
“A significant portion of the Public Benefits charge in rates effective May 1st comes from last year’s under-recoveries — which occur when the actual costs the electric companies spent don’t match what they expected so rates are adjusted to fill that gap,” the Office of Consumer Counsel said in a statement this week. “While the companies track costs in detail, they do not measure these gaps on a per program basis. OCC believes it is important for consumers to be able to pin-point what drives both costs and the over or under-recoveries on a per program basis. We are currently advocating at PURA for improvements to both the companies’ accounting methodologies and the [rate adjustment mechanism] process as a whole.”
Last year, the biggest portion of the public benefits charge came from a collection of hardship programs such as Operation Fuel and the low-income discount rate that are intended to help certain customers pay for their utility bills. Another portion of the charge comes from unpaid bills that the utilities have deemed “uncollectable” — and which they are allowed to recoup from the rest of their customers.
Unpaid bills can accumulate during the winter, when Connecticut law prohibits utilities from cutting off heat to low-income customers. State regulators also paused shutoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Together the cost of hardship programs and unpaid bills accounted for nearly a quarter of Eversource’s total public benefits charge and more than 45% of the charge for United Illuminating.
What about Millstone?
Another slice of the public benefits charge that had received heavy scrutiny is the state’s decadelong contract to procure power from the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford.
Under that deal, the utilities are required to purchase half of Millstone’s output at the set price until 2029. The deal was made after the plant’s owner, Dominion Energy, threatened to shut it down due to competition from cheaper natural gas plants.
When the price of natural gas rises — as it did at the start of Russia’s 2021 invasion of Ukraine — the utilities can sell the power back to the grid at a profit that gets passed along to customers through a credit on the public benefits charge. When gas is cheaper, however, that power is sold at a loss that ends up costing customers more.
Eversource has previously stated that the Millstone contract was responsible for the large majority of a spike in the public benefits charge that hit its customers last summer. Since then, however, more favorable economic conditions have lowered the impact Millstone has on customers’ bills.
Late last month, the PURA approved an adjustment to the public benefits charge and other transmission-related charges that are expected to collectively lower bills by about $13 a month for the average Eversource customer and $3 for the average United Illuminating customer. 
Why were so few people aware of the charge before?
The public benefits charge existed mostly in obscurity — lumped in as part of the larger delivery component of most bills — until 2023, when lawmakers passed legislation requiring utilities breakout the cost of the public benefit charges through a line item on customers’ bills.
As it would happen, the bill redesign took effect just before a spike in the public benefits charge last summer and a subsequent heat wave that sent customers’ bills soaring.
Anger quickly rippled across social media, newspaper editorials and into the halls of the state Capitol, where some politicians seized upon the issue in an election year.
Republicans is the legislature pitched a plan to shift the cost of the public benefits charge onto state coffers, calling it a “hidden tax” on utility customers.
Democrats and Gov. Ned Lamont have for the most part rejected that idea, arguing that the costs of those programs — nearly $1 billion in 2024 — would be difficult to squeeze into the budget without raising taxes or cutting spending on other programs. 
The co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, said this week that he is in the process of drafting legislation that would propose borrowing money to pay off a portion of the public benefits charge like uncollectables and energy efficiency investments, while leaving the rest of the charge in place. A copy of that legislation is not yet available to the public. 
What do the utilities say about the charge?
Because they make minimal profits off programs within the public benefits charge, the stance from utilities has ranged from ambivalence to frustration that customer anger is directed at them, rather than at policymakers who created the programs in the first place. 
“It’s not for us to say if Public Benefits costs should be on a customer’s energy bill,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in a statement. “That’s a public policy decision.”
Ratliff went on to say that the the utility supports Connecticut’s decarbonization efforts — many of which are funded through the public benefits charge — and that other programs “provide critical value” to customers.
“However, we do recognize that having the costs of those state-mandated programs on an energy bill is regressive for lower income customers and removing that charge from electric bills and paying for it through a more progressive system would reduce an average residential customer’s bill by up to $43 per month,” Ratliff said, referring to the amount paid by a standard service customer using 700 kilowatt-hours a month of electricity.
Sarah Wall Fliotsos, a spokeswoman for United Illuminating, sent a similar statement this week pointing out that the public benefits charge stems from programs that were put in place by legislators. 
“We encourage our customers to contact their elected officials with any questions or concerns regarding this portion of their energy charges,” Fliotsos said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EXPLAINER-PUBLIC-BENEFITS-0509-SR-1-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764

Two of the country’s largest collections of Native American human remains are held by museums in Illinois.

To the director of one of the museums, the work to rebury those remains at the behest of a tribal nation or send them to the tribe is an emotional process necessary for correcting historic wrongs – but it also includes a lot of bureaucratic paperwork that can take months to years to process.

And it takes so long for a reason.

The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA, is a federal law that requires a museum or institution to publish public notices if any human remains or funerary objects it holds belong to a tribal nation.

NAGPRA has existed in a couple of forms since 1990 when Congress first passed it.

By December 2023, the U.S. Department of Interior gave clarification about the now-35-year-old law: Museums and institutions with human remains must reach out to the tribal nations first – not the other way around.

Different groups noted this update to NAGPRA is particularly important – before this, institutions did not have to reach out to tribal nations first, although some institutions were already doing so, like the Illinois State Museum or University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

But even with the change, tribal and museum representatives note the return process is slow.

Raphael Wahwassuck, a council member and citizen of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, Illinois’ only federally recognized tribe, said that when he started as the tribe’s point of contact for NAGPRA, he was initially greeted by stacks of paperwork.

“I had bankers boxes, probably four high, 10 rows deep, of notices that come in,” Wahwassuck said. “Since that time, we've cleaned up our internal processes to where now we're asking for a lot of electronic notices. … I could probably check my phone right now and have maybe 50 (notices), and, it’s just – I don't know that it will ever slow down.”

Two state-run museums and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are making progress on their repatriation efforts with the help of recent legislation, but a small nonprofit museum near the state's western border has been slower at complying with the repatriation process.

Institutions have until 2029 to publish all of their notices. If they don’t, they can face civil penalties from the U.S. Department of Interior.

A base penalty was established by the DOI for thousands of dollars, which can be increased based on damages tribes suffered or on the historical, commercial, ceremonial, cultural or archaeological value.

Before the most recent NAGPRA revision, the DOI collected about $60,000 in civil penalties between fiscal year 1990 and fiscal year 2024.

Illinois State Museum and Dickson Mounds

The Illinois State Museum and Dickson Mounds Museum are both divisions of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The Illinois State Museum is located in Springfield just beside the state Capitol. Dickson Mounds, a museum built atop burial mounds, is in Lewistown, southwest of Peoria.

Combined, the two institutions hold the second-largest collection of Native human remains of any institution in the country.

Of the 5,789 remains it holds, about 26% have notices published in the federal register;  last year, over 1,000 notices were published all at once as part of a multi-year effort.

Both locations have been home to controversy over the years, as they had human remains of Native Americans on display for public viewing in decades past, which modern-day American anthropologists would generally consider unethical.

Logan Pappenfort, the director of tribal relations for the Illinois State Museum and formerly the interim director of Dickson Mounds Museum, has been doing NAGPRA work for years.

Before living in Illinois, Pappenfort was the Peoria Tribe of Oklahoma’s director of cultural preservation, where he is also a citizen. The Peoria Tribe has historic ties to central Illinois, having lived for centuries in the current-day Lake Michigan and St. Louis areas.

He said the reasons it takes so long for remains to be returned and reburied are complicated.

Pappenfort said excavation of human remains wasn’t consistently regulated for decades. NAGPRA’s passage created some regulations for excavating on federal land or land near federal tribes, but it was still up to states and even counties to designate guidelines for remains found on private property.

At the Dickson Mounds Museum, a chiropractor named Don Dickson dug up some burial mounds on his property in the 1900s and built a museum on top of it so people could see into the ground below them. The state acquired it in 1945 so it could be turned into a state park.

Native Americans widely protested the museum for decades, as it previously displayed human remains until 1992 when it closed to remove remains from display at the behest of former Gov. Jim Edgar, then it reopened in 1994.

The state hasn’t published notices for about 74% of the remains held by ISM and Dickson Mounds, and Pappenfort acknowledged there’s still work to do.

However, he said it’s unlikely that the state ever reduces the number of remains in its care to zero.



[caption id=""attachment_67344"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] The Illinois State Museum is pictured in Springfield, just south of the Illinois State Capitol. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Jerry Nowicki)[/caption]



The main reason: The Illinois State Museum serves as a repository for any remains found in other institutions within state borders that can’t be identified.

Wahwassuck said remains can sometimes be found unexpectedly across the state.

“I was just at another institution the other day, and when I first met with them, they assured me that they didn't have anything in their collections,” Wahwassuck said. “Well one of their long tenured employees retired, and as they were cleaning out their workspace, lo and behold, they found a box, and within the box was remains and other items, and so then that caused them to do a complete overview of their entire organization and, sure enough, they found that they had many, many ancestral remains and other items. And it wasn't anything intentional by the organization, per se.”

30 years of relationship building

The state has been trying to make sure that remains can be reburied swiftly to keep up with federal law and be respectful to Native communities. That’s why the General Assembly gave IDNR the power in 2023 to control a private cemetery so reburial could be a valid option.

Now, Pappenfort said most tribes opt to rebury ancestors in IDNR’s private, secretive burial site instead of taking them out of the state and reburying them there, which can be seen as akin to removal all over again.

“In the ‘90s when NAGPRA was new, my tribe, we brought ancestors back to Oklahoma from Illinois because we did not have the confidence at that point that they would not be disturbed again if they were reburied here,” Pappenfort said. “Now, through agreements, legislation, relationships built, there is a confidence that this is where they will be if they are reburied here.

“And so, that's been one of those things that's not been overnight. I mean, this has been a relationship-building exercise 30 years in the making.”

Sen. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, who was trained as an anthropologist, helped pass the bill that would allow Native American remains to be reburied by IDNR.

Walker said reburial was something he found people were open to because it avoided remains “retracing the Trail of Tears” by leaving the state to somewhere else.

“(The bill) allows us to gather those remains and put them back where we got them, to reinter them, to have their own cemetery, to bury them with honor,” Walker said at the time.

Center for American Archeology

The Center for American Archeology in Kampsville, which has the second-largest collection of Native human remains in the state and 13th largest in the country, has not published any public notices to the federal register despite holding almost 2,000 remains.



[caption id=""attachment_67342"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] A sign shows the word “CLOSED” in the front window of the Center for American Archeology.

The museum in Calhoun County on the state’s western border is a nonprofit that receives federal grants, making it subject to NAGPRA. It’s been operating since 1953.

The center’s director said its collection came from excavations since the 1950s.

According to its website, due to multiple floods and the COVID-19 shutdown, the museum closed until a new building could be built. But the rebuilding project has been “put on hold indefinitely” because of a federal freeze on awarded Federal Emergency Management Agency grants.

The director of the center, Jason King, told Capitol News Illinois none of the remains were damaged during the floods because none of them were publicly displayed. He also said he has reached out to 25 tribes since the updates to NAGPRA.



[caption id=""attachment_67341"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] The inside of the Center for American Archeology sits mostly empty aside from a few pieces of furniture and a sign that says “MUSEUM.” The Center is closed while it waits for FEMA grants to be reinstated. (Capitol News Illinois photos by Bridgette Fox)[/caption]



In 2023, before the update to the law, King told  ProPublica, “To date, no tribes have requested repatriation of remains or objects from the CAA.”

ProPublica’s series published in that year identified how “America’s museums fail to return Native American human remains,” identifying how Illinois was one of the worst states for repatriation.

King, who has served as director of the Center since 2017, noted that it doesn’t have the resources of larger institutions.

“The nature of how this operates has changed over time, and my read on the center’s history and what we’re doing now is that we are a different kind of organization than a university or the state system,” King said. “We are making a good faith effort to do the best we can to move this process forward.”

King said the bulk of the remains the center holds are from field excavations from various research programs over the years. Nowadays, the center conducts field research after receiving permits from the state to excavate what were once sites of homes or refuse pits.

Notices are published closer to when remains are ready for repatriation; so while the center has reached out to tribes, it’s unclear whether those conversations will bear fruit until notices have been published in the National Park Services’ NAGPRA database.

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

In central Illinois, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign created a NAGPRA office in 2020 to do the kind of work that was eventually turned into a requirement of the law.

“Since the university created the NAGPRA office and has actually dedicated time and staff and resources, things like that, to NAGPRA, that's part of why we've been able to so greatly increase our activity in the last few years,” said Krystiana Krupa, UIUC senior program officer for NAGPRA.

Since the office’s creation, there’s been a significant spike in notices made by the university with 70% of its 192 total notices being made since 2020.

Krupa said most of the remains that UIUC holds come from the anthropology department going on faculty excavations over the decades.

Of the 760 human remains held by the university, there have been 192 notices sent to tribes. The majority of those notices were sent after the university started its NAGPRA office.

An endless ‘emotional toll’

Another complicating factor is that many remains are considered “culturally unidentifiable.” In the original NAGPRA text, remains could only be repatriated or reburied if they could be definitively linked to a specific tribal nation – without a direct, definitive tie, the culture couldn’t be identified.

For tribal nations, this could be tricky because of how frequently people were forcibly removed from the land; and before European colonialism, land control varied over the course of history.

So, finding out which tribe was somewhere at a certain time could sometimes be complicated, which is why the update to NAGPRA’ definition of “cultural affiliation” can be important.

The U.S. Department of Interior said a tribe’s cultural affiliation to remains could at least be reasonably identified “by the geographical location or acquisition history of the human remains or cultural items.”

With just the preponderance of a cultural connection required, remains that couldn’t definitively be linked to any single tribe are going through the NAGPRA process instead of staying stuck in collections.

Pappenfort said preparing remains for reburial is a delicate – and emotional – process.

“Every day I was doing that work was a toll emotionally for me because I am essentially preparing people I think of as my ancestors for burial. All of us have a handful of times in our life that we experience grief; and in a day, I could experience that same grief a hundred times,” Pappenfort said. “I remember there are a couple days that I even had to step away and collect myself. And so that type of work is hard work, but it's also heart work. And it has to come from somewhere in here.”

House Bill 121 would restrict access to bathrooms based strictly on biological sex. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)A district court judge in Missoula extended a pause on state officials from enforcing a new Montana law restricting access to public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping spaces based on an individual’s sex assigned at birth.
Missoula District Court Judge Shane Vannatta’s 51-page ruling Friday delivered a preliminary injunction blocking House Bill 121 from being enforced. Vannatta last month issued a temporary restraining order on the bill.
“This ruling reaffirms the truth about bathroom bans: they’re motivated by prejudice, and they don’t protect anyone,” said Robin Turner, Montana staff attorney at Legal Voice working with the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “HB 121 undermines Montana’s strong constitutional protections against government overreach and subjects people to unacceptable privacy violations. Transgender people are vulnerable to violence in restrooms, and they deserve protection instead of persecution.”
HB 121, sponsored by Billings Republican Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, applies to all public facilities and those that receive public funding, including correctional centers, juvenile detention facilities, local domestic violence programs, public buildings and public schools. It includes leased public spaces and covers libraries, museums, hospitals, and university buildings, and it requires covered entities to “take reasonable steps” to keep members of the opposite sex out.
In the suit, plaintiffs, including transgender and intersex Montanans, argue HB 121 violates their rights under the state constitution, including “the rights to equal protection, privacy, to pursue life’s basic necessities, and due process.”
Attorneys for the State of Montana argued that the law is intended to provide additional protection and privacy for women and girls in these spaces from biological males.
“Today, we’re maintaining equal opportunity for all Americans, while also protecting women and girls and their right to safe and separate facilities and activities,” Gianforte said in a statement when he signed HB 121 in March. “Because we think it’s pretty simple. A man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom. Shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room. And shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison.”
In the court ruling, Vannatta says that the state’s argument that the law is not discriminatory against transgender people — because the definitions of “sex,” “male,” and “female” apply to all Montanans — is “disingenuous.”
The plaintiffs in court documents argued that transgender Montanans have been subjected to repeated unequal treatment by the state, pointing to five separate bills passed by the Montana Legislature over the last three sessions that target transgender individuals.
“Transgender Montanans have been subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment and have been relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection.”
The court order also says that the state has so far failed to support its arguments that the law helps protect women by not providing evidence of “how female privacy and safety are threatened by trans females.”
“In addition, the State does not provide evidence of how the safety of trans females may be implicated by requiring trans females to use men’s restrooms. The State does not provide evidence of how cis female privacy and safety may be implicated by requiring trans males to use the women’s restrooms,” according to the order.
The state can appeal the decision to the Montana Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the preliminary injunction will remain in place until the court rules on the complaint.
The decision follows another last week by a Missoula County District Court judge that permanently struck down a law from the 2023 Legislature that sought to ban gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bathroom-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 07:07:15.349066

To support homeless neighbors whose lives are wracked by instability, consistency on our end is key.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sam Bliss: Food Not Cops feeds your neighbors, and makes us all safer.","This commentary is by Sam Bliss. He teaches applied economics at the University of Vermont and has spent the last eight years researching and participating in non-market food practices in northern New England.Anyone who’s hungry is welcome to eat at the free buffet along the low brick wall.Every day for the past five years, a ragtag group of Burlingtonians has shared lunch behind the Marketplace Garage off Cherry Street from 1-2 p.m. Several thousand neighbors have gifted food, cooked meals and washed the dishes.We’re called Food Not Cops — the local chapter of Food Not Bombs, an international movement that shares food in parks and plazas to protest the use of public resources for weapons and war instead of meeting basic human needs like food.Why the wall behind the parking garage? It’s not a comfortable, welcoming environment. When we started, Covid-19 had just broken out. We wanted people to grab food or gear and then leave, rather than gather and breathe on each other. Those were scary times.In the ensuing years, the wall has become a gathering place. We stay because everyone knows to find us there. Sometimes friends disappear for months — maybe they are traveling, working or incarcerated — and then they reappear one day, waiting at the wall with an empty belly or a request for help. To support homeless neighbors whose lives are wracked by instability, consistency on our end is key. The Cherry Street garage is near where many of our unhoused friends hang out downtown. Gathering outdoors, in a place where people can depart in three different directions, helps de-escalate conflicts — and it spares the group from having to play bouncer in any doorway. Nearby dumpsters make it easy to clean up daily.The fact that it’s not a sought-after space has worked in our favor, too: the wall area was unused, so nobody asks us to step aside for more important matters.Until recently, that is. Local business owners, in an open letter about the “crisis” in downtown Burlington, are asking Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak to kick Food Not Cops out of our spot. Several outspoken members of the business community have been blaming our free lunch distribution for alleged safety issues in the garage where Church Street shoppers park.Last September, the City of Burlington started paying $1,500 every week to station a rent-a-sheriff in the garage on weekdays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., a shift that is centered on our hour-long pop-up buffet. Friends now tell me they avoid Food Not Cops, and the assistance on offer, because of the sheriff’s presence. You wouldn’t want to hang out next to a sheriff, either, if you were homeless.The truth is, Marketplace Garage isn’t a hot spot for crime, despite the city designating it as one. The city government’s open data site shows that since 2020, dozens of Burlington locations have recorded more police incidents than Marketplace Garage, which has seen 126 incidents, with just two of those Priority One, meaning they involved dire threats to physical safety.Compare that with City Hall Park (2,336 incidents; 156 of them Priority 1 or the intersection of Church and Main (1,008 incidents; 57 Priority 1).So, why are local business owners blaming us for their downtown woes?My best guess is that they identify Marketplace Garage as a public safety concern because they don’t want customers to have to interact with any poor people on their walk from their vehicle to the stores they’ll shop at.That’s understandable. Having to witness suffering or deprivation on one’s way to purchase outdoor gear or lunch at Leunig’s can provoke feelings of not just guilt but fear. I suspect my homeless buddies resent me when I begrudgingly buy them one tall can of cheap beer but then I splurge on a spendy four-pack of some imperial porter with an artsy label for myself.If we don’t want to have to look at unhoused people, then our best bet is to house them. Let’s work together on that. I don’t like my neighbors being unhoused, either.The letter from the business class says that our lunch “has had a negative impact on the area.”I think they’re wrong: Food Not Cops makes downtown safer.First, fed people behave better than hungry people. Think about how you treat people when you’re hangry.Second, people are not seagulls; they don’t simply fly away when you don’t offer them food. The letter notes: “Some attendees have repeatedly stolen from businesses or caused harm.” We believe that people deserve to be fed even if they’ve done bad things.Third, Food Not Cops is an alternative to shoplifting for people with unmet needs but no money. We direct resources toward where they are needed, helping broke and homeless folks with camping gear, phone cards, propane and toiletries. Donate to our fund if you can. With no paid staff or overhead, every dollar buys people things they need.Our lunches create cross-class relationships of solidarity. Housed and unhoused neighbors eat and chat together. We learn to understand and trust people who aren’t like us — and see others as fully human. These strong relationships help keep the community safer.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sam Bliss: Food Not Cops feeds your neighbors, and makes us all safer.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-19 07:07:15.349066

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)You’ve heard of the U.S. Constitution, right? You can see one of the 1789 originals right there in the National Archives.
At least until the current regime shuts the place down for harboring wokey documents.
You can get yourself a cheap copy of the newest iteration — the one with the freedom of speech part as well as the birthright citizenship, the equal protection under the law, the votes for women, term limits for presidents, and other exciting stuff — small enough to fit in your pocket.
Many of us feel quite attached to the Constitution. Not the current regime, of course, but, you know, actual, normal, sane Americans, at least half the country, maybe even more.
Florida also has a pretty good Constitution. From time to time, citizens have voted to make it even better, trying to improve education, preserve the environment, increase the minimum wage.
The problem is, the governor and the Legislature don’t much like the Florida Constitution. They don’t much like each other, either. And they really don’t like that actual, normal, sane Floridians have been able to amend that Constitution. So now they’ve made it damn near impossible.
A new law demands that petition circulators and petition signers provide all manner of ID, a Florida driver’s license, and last four digits of their Social Security number. Only Florida residents can gather signatures. All signatures have to be turned into the supervisor of elections 10 days after the voter signs or the gatherer will be fined $50 per day per signer.
If voters sign on or before Feb. 1 in an election year, the fine for late turn-ins is $100 a pop, and, if the gatherer “acted willfully” in holding onto voter info and providing late petitions, it’ll cost the gatherer $5,000 a pop.
If you’re not registered as a petition collector and you have in your possession more than 25 signatures in addition to your own petition form or one from a family member, you could be charged with a third-degree felony.
And if Mars aligns with Saturn on a rainy Tuesday in an odd-numbered year, well, you’re going to jail, Buster.
Pregnant pigs
The sponsors of this idiotic bill claim it’s necessary, pointing to a 900-page report alleging all manner of malfeasance in the 2024 campaigns to approve reproductive rights and allow recreational marijuana use.
The report was issued by Ron DeSantis’ own goon squad, the Office of Election Crimes, the same clown car cops who went around arresting people for Voting While Black. This large and extensive investigation netted 18 arrests. Nearly 1 million people, real live Floridians, signed the petition.
In the end, 57.2% voted “yes” on Amendment 4; 42.8%voted “no.” In a normal democracy, we’d call that a win. Of course, Florida is not a normal democracy: maybe not much of a democracy at all.
The Legislature can stick any amendment they favor on the ballot. You, Floridian, have to jump through hoops of fire, spin straw into gold, and answer the Riddle of the Sphinx.
An amendment needs 60% to pass. It used to be a simple majority, but after citizens voted in the notorious pregnant pig amendment, many thought the threshold for enshrining something in the Constitution should be higher and chose to toughen the standard.
You can kind of see why: Outlawing cruelty to our porcine friends was well and good, but did it really belong in the document that lays out the ideals and laws governing the state? I mean, if you want to see an out-of-control constitution, look at Alabama’s: It’s around 370,000 words long and has 900 amendments addressing such issues such as playing dominoes, impersonating a preacher, and driving while blindfolded.
Problem is, if you have a gerrymandered-to-all-hell Legislature, completely unresponsive to the needs of the citizens, amending the Constitution is about the only way to get genuinely important measures passed.
In 2014, 75 percent of Florida voters said “yes” to the Water and Land Conservation Act, which mandated the state use a percentage of real estate taxes to buy and manage properties critical to clean water and wildlife habitat.
But the Legislature and various state agencies chose to ignore what three-quarters of Floridians clearly said they wanted. While the state bought some land with the money, it also paid for office furniture, computers, salaries, even ball caps — none of which do much for the natural environment.
Politicians know better, right?
Thwarting the voters
Same with the class-size amendment, passed in 2002. Voters said K-12 students would learn better if classes weren’t over-stuffed. Then-Gov. Jeb Bush and the Legislature shrugged and refused to enforce the will of the people.
In 2020, voters said how about we gradually increase the minimum wage to a princely 15 bucks an hour by 2026? (FYI: A “living wage” for a single person in Florida is about $23 an hour.)
This year, the Legislature thought maybe we didn’t really mean that and why not let employers pay less than the current minimum of $13 an hour? They called these indentured-servitude jobs “pre-apprenticeships” and “work-based learning opportunities” for young people who don’t happen to belong to the middle-class and might learn valuable skills such as tomato-picking and lawn maintenance.
In a rare moment of sanity during this year’s legislative session, that bill failed. But the governor and Legislature succeeded in casting citizens’ ballot initiatives as ethically and legally dubious.
There was indeed an element of alleged criminality surrounding the abortion and marijuana amendments — on the governor’s part. He weaponized the state against Amendment 4, sending police to petition signers’ homes to question them, posting misinformation on state websites, and threatened broadcasters who ran ads promoting reproductive rights with criminal charges.
Hope Florida, a foundation controlled by Casey DeSantis, used taxpayer money to fight Amendment 3.
Even some Republicans were appalled by this misuse of public funds. Indeed, the only good thing about the new bill is that it bans state officials from using your money to promote or vilify a proposed amendment.
It’s not airtight. But maybe it will slow down Florida’s march toward autocracy.

(Getty Images)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s administration is getting serious about tolling to make up for falling fuel tax revenue and upgrade aging highways — eight years after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration backed away from the prospect.
The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) “is working closely with the governor’s office, looking at different options: routes, the tolling process, the application, all of it as a whole, to see what makes the most sense (and) where need is greatest,” the agency said.
The governor’s office confirmed its interest.
“No decisions have been made,” Chief of Staff Josh Kelley cautioned.
“But tolling has to be considered to maintain our current and future infrastructure and we are exploring all potential options,” he added.

Strategic changes housed in recently approved legislation could give those efforts a boost.
But the loosened restrictions have sparked opposition from cash-strapped Hoosiers — and those already paying tolls along borders with Illinois and Kentucky.
And it’s not as easy as simply adding tolls to existing interstates.
U.S. law generally bans user fees on federal-aid highways, including those that make up the Interstate Highway System.
There are exceptions, of course.
One program allows tolling on new highways, bridges and tunnels, plus on new lanes, as long as the number of toll-free lanes doesn’t decrease. Reconstructed or replaced bridges and tunnels also qualify.
Another program lets states toll high occupancy vehicle lanes. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) also offers two limited-slot pilot programs.
Familiar terrain
Tolling-curious Indiana has been down this road before.
Fuel taxes produce more than 82% of Indiana’s transportation infrastructure dollars. But Indiana is just 140 miles wide on average, so those who drive through without filling up don’t pay in.
And uptake of fuel-efficient and electric vehicles is expected to cost the state millions, jeopardizing maintenance and expansion plans for vast stretches of crumbling asphalt and concrete.
Lawmakers in 2017 recognized that long-term challenge, advancing legislation that gave Holcomb the power to add tolls. The law also mandated detailed examinations of the concept.
One feasibility study, produced that year for INDOT, estimated that a statewide interstate highway tolling program would have an 85% chance of generating upwards of $39 billion between 2021 and 2050.
It further reported a 50% chance that revenue could exceed $53 billion over that timeframe. The estimates didn’t include the likely significant costs to install and maintain tolling gantries, process payments, provide customer service, enforce collections and more.
Also that year, INDOT produced a strategic plan exploring how it could implement that tolling program.
One of the law’s related requirements — that Holcomb’s INDOT seek federal approval for the tolling initiative — wasn’t fulfilled, the agency confirmed to the Capital Chronicle.

A 10-cent fuel tax hike, accompanied by six years worth of inflation-indexed increases capped to a penny each, did go into effect. In 2023, his last year in office, Holcomb authorized a three-year extension.
It’s just a stop-gap.
“The public has made it very clear nobody wants to pay more for anything right now,” Build Indiana Council Executive Director Brian Gould said. But, he added, “If we continue to look at the model that we operate under right now, we likely would have been talking about a 30-cent gas tax increase this year.”
“So, in order to keep that off the table and keep the plan solvent, you’ve got to look at other funding mechanisms that are out there,” continued Gould, whose industry group seeks sustained funding for Indiana roads and bridges.
That’s why Braun is getting more serious about tolling.
“It’s going to have to be considered because, otherwise, I don’t think we can maintain our main arteries. Asking for the ability to do it doesn’t mean you’re going to do it comprehensively,” he said at a Munster luncheon this month, WTHR reported. “You do it selectively, where the need is the greatest.”
Roadblocks removed
Tucked among House Enrolled Act 1461‘s myriad local funding tweaks are detailed revisions to Indiana tolling laws.
Lawmakers, for example, nullified a ban on new tolls within 75 miles of interstate highways and bridges that already had tolls in 2017. INDOT said the change “provides some more flexibility in terms of locations.”

But Hoosiers already living near tolled facilities object.
Driving the 70-year-old northern Indiana Toll Road‘s 157-mile span costs the typical passenger vehicle more than $15 and can approach $100 for the heaviest-duty, six-axle vehicles. Crossing any of three RiverLink bridges to the south — tolled since 2016 — costs between $2.61 and $15.61 a pop, depending on payment and vehicle type.
The prohibition previously shielded Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser’s Kentucky border community from new additions as far up as Columbus, Indiana.
Now, the Jeffersonville Democrat said, “We could be tolled at mile marker one.” She warned that more tolls in the area would prompt “a lot of noise.”
In some instances, what was stripped out of law is “about as important” as what was added, Gould said.
Careful deletions in House Enrolled Act 1461 also allow the Indiana Finance Authority to take on debt to pay for transportation infrastructure projects, effective July 1.
That is “something that’s not been an option for INDOT for almost two decades,” Gould said. The changes, he added, will let the state leverage its AAA credit rating to finance projects upfront, then use tolling revenue to pay the debt — “easing the burden on Hoosiers.”

“We were almost working in reverse order, because so much of what the state was trying to get to was actually in existing law (as) a prohibition,” he said.
Other tweaks removed requirements that lawmakers specifically authorize certain tolling-related activities.
INDOT said it hadn’t yet narrowed down which exceptions or facilities it was considering.
The agency is “still … casting a wide net, looking at all options, as we move forward,” it said.
Implementing tolling would be a “multi-year process,” per INDOT.
Gould said that in between now and then, “Hoosiers can expect to see major reconstruction of those interstates and expanded capacity. So I think people should likely be pretty pleased with what they see, not happy about paying for it.”

But educators, parents and government officials in this Washington are tracking closely whether President Donald Trump makes good on his threats to cut funding to states that do not prove they have abandoned K-12 diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
Fear, anger and defiance have been the response here so far. The fear runs deep. The defiance comes from the top: the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction or OSPI.
Although most of the districts I reached out to for this story weren’t interested in discussing their plans for navigating these issues, education consultant Erin Jones told me that at a recent meeting with King County superintendents, officials were worried.
“They are concerned about budget cuts. But they are most concerned about the uncertainty. That’s the point of this administration: uncertainty. That leaves them in such a bad place,” Jones recalled. “These leaders want to do right by their children and their staff.”
Rising tensions
The U.S. Education Department sent a letter to state education agencies in February, accusing schools of promoting diversity in a way that unfairly harmed white and Asian American students. 
In support of this statement, they cited a 2023 Supreme Court decision that banned using race as an element in college admissions. That case didn’t mention K-12 schools, but that didn’t stop the Trump administration from using it as a reason why Washington and other states shouldn’t be providing extra academic support for students of color.  
In early April, the U.S. Education Department doubled down, with another letter. This one demanded proof that states were following their DEI orders. 
Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal’s response reaffirmed this state’s strong commitment to embracing its diversity and making sure every student gets the help they need. 
“Recognition of our diversity is a cornerstone of public education. It makes us stronger, more civil, and it empowers groups of students who have historically been marginalized or denied equal opportunities,” Reykdal said in a statement. He confirmed that these efforts are paying off in higher graduation and college participation rates for everyone. Plus, Reykdal added, every student benefits from the diversity in our schools.
“Washington will not suppress its core values or cede our right to determine our own education system to the federal government,” he said.  In just a few words, he underscored a key facet of American education: states, not the federal government, take the lead in determining what their children will learn in public schools.
Reykdal’s office continues to draw attention from the Trump administration. 
Later in April, the Department of Education said it would investigate OSPI over “requiring school boards to adopt policies that allow males to participate in female sports and occupy female-only intimate facilities.” This followed the federal agency scrutinizing OSPI over how it handled a years-long controversy surrounding the gender-inclusion policy at the La Center School District in Clark County.
Jones, the education consultant, said she hasn’t met a leader yet who is not committed to continuing diversity, equity and inclusion work. Some are renaming it, opting instead for terms like “community building.” 
Another consequence of Trump era rhetoric and policies that Jones has been hearing about is decreased attendance by Latino students. “No matter what the principal has said that we’re going to protect you from ICE, why should they trust you?” she asked.
“I think we’re afraid for good reason,” Jones added.
Trish Millines Dziko, executive director of the Technology Access Foundation, a Seattle-based nonprofit offering supplemental STEM education in public schools and after-school programs, has also heard that Latino attendance has dropped. And the parents of children who are showing up for school don’t want them participating in field trips.
So far, this is just anecdotal evidence. Detailed attendance data probably won’t be available to the public until next year. Dziko believes the full impact of the Trump administration on education won’t be understood for months or even years.
“There’s a lot of anxiety,” said Dziko, who has overheard immigrant children as well as LGBTQ students and staff talking to each other. “They’re all very close to each other and they worry about each other. …I don’t know if it’s stopping education from happening. But you can hear the conversations between some of the kids.”
After reaching out to about half the districts in the Puget Sound region, plus some in eastern Washington, only one was willing to put someone on the phone to talk to me. Dziko and others I talked to felt this lack of response was born out of fear.
Teachable moment
The state’s largest school district is choosing to carry on and keep working to lift up every child from every background despite threats from the Trump administration. Seattle Public School’s Black education program manager, Anita Koyier-Mwamba, pointed to Head Start office closures and the president’s DEI orders as examples of factors fueling uncertainty.
Still, she believes the difficulties should not stop educators from using this time as a teachable moment.
“It is really important to me that we recognize that history has left us a wonderful catalog of opportunities to explore.”
And then she took a delightful path into American history and the young men like Thomas Jefferson who were so passionate about democracy but didn’t do everything right 250 years ago, although they were trying to solve the problems of their time. 
Why does she want us to think about the 19- and 20-year-olds sitting around debating the birth of a nation? Because it’s a good reminder that young people can think for themselves and should have an opportunity to do so.
“It is unjust not to give our young people the opportunity to … solve the problems of their time,” Koyier-Mwamba said. 
And that comes down to a discussion about justice that must account for the nation’s past. 
This is American history, not diversity indoctrination: The enslavement of people kidnapped and brought here to work the land. The way we have treated the indigenous people before and after the United States became a country. How the Constitution treated enslaved people when the founders couldn’t agree to take a better path. The Civil War and what happened to enslaved people afterward. Fifty years between giving white women and Black women the right to vote.
“Focusing on our shared humanity is an avenue to reconsider how we respond in these times of challenge,” Koyier-Mwamba said. Part of that is choosing to be optimistic, deciding to see the light in the darkness through American heroes like abolitionist Harriet Tubman. 
Similarly, Dziko sees an opportunity to rethink how we do things as a state and a nation. Making sure every student gets the education they need to succeed is not an impossible goal. Dziko believes, and I agree, that state dollars for education could be distributed in a way that focuses more on equity.
“Our kids deserve better,” Dziko said, adding that education reform is directly related to state budget reform because it will take more money to create a more equitable system. 
The 29-year-old Technology Access Foundation does not get federal grants, so Dziko is not concerned about backlash from the federal government.
Where the Trump administration pushes against DEI programs because they say they unfairly advantage Black and Brown people, Dziko and I see racism. “The whole thing has been reduced to, ‘If you are Black, then you did not deserve the position you’re in.’ That’s a very dangerous viewpoint,” she said.
Unfortunately, this viewpoint isn’t new. Dziko is worried about how far back we will go. Before the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education that ruled racial segregation of public schools was unconstitutional?
“I’m always the eternal optimist in my family, but I’m not this time around,” Dziko said.
“We’re going backwards,” she added.
Jones is also feeling pessimistic.
“They want to make America in their image, and their image is white straight men,” said Jones. “They’ve done a really good job of making everything DEI that they just don’t like,” she said. “I’ve really been grieving.”
Like Dziko, while she rejects the Republican vision for education, she is also not satisfied with the status quo. “Republicans say burn it all down, it all sucks. That is not a strategy. The Democrats don’t have a vision,” she said. “Let’s all talk about it. So we have something to activate us. Just saying I don’t want this is not enough. We need people with vision who are imagining a better way forward.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 07:07:15.349066

(Photo by Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)With the conclusion of Indiana’s 2025 legislative session, Hoosiers have reason to be proud  of our state’s leadership on energy policy during this dynamic period of unprecedented  energy demand. The legislature leaned into pragmatic, forward-looking solutions that  balanced reliability, affordability, and innovation — all while reinforcing Indiana’s  commitment to economic growth and building upon current law. 
The nexus of energy and economic development was at the heart of this year’s public policy proposals introduced by Sen. Eric Koch and Rep. Ed Soliday. Whether it  was urging state and federal coordination, supporting emerging technologies like small  modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced transmission technologies, or speeding up  generation build out for large customers, lawmakers and Gov. Mike Braun’s administration  worked with purpose to keep Indiana competitive and demonstrate leadership on key  issues facing our state and nation. 
The adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 3 urges regional transmission organizations  and the federal government to take action on expediting the approval of electric  transmission and generation projects. This resolution recognizes that the ability to quickly develop and build additive energy infrastructure is critical to economic development and  the utilities’ obligation to serve Hoosier customers 24/7/365. 
The bipartisan passage of HEA 1007 addresses economic development, as well, by creating  a 20% tax credit for the manufacturing of SMRs in Indiana. This aligns with the governor’s vision to be a leader in nuclear development and ensures Indiana stays competitive in  attracting a supply chain and developing a workforce needed to meet long-term energy  needs. Additionally, it accelerates regulatory review of generation and infrastructure  projects needed to serve large customers, such as data centers and semiconductor manufacturers. It also includes strong protections for existing and future customers. This is  a win-win as it ensures large customers pay their fair share while making sure the energy industry can meet its obligation to serve at the speed of business.

The General Assembly also focused on reliability of the electric grid and bringing new  generation online. For example, it now requires regulatory review of generation retirements to ensure there is adequate capacity going forward. Another example is SEA  424, which removes initial barriers to the development of SMRs by addressing the upfront costs associated with research and planning. The law allows utilities to charge customers in  real time as costs are incurred, as opposed to all at once after the fact, which saves  customers money. This is similar to how costs are already recovered during the  construction process with ongoing regulatory review. 
The passage of SEA 422 requires the study of advanced transmission technology by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the consideration of it in planning by electric utilities. This is beneficial for Hoosiers because advanced transmission technologies have the potential to improve efficiency and boost capacity in certain applications thereby saving  customers money.  
Recognizing the importance and benefits of natural gas, policymakers added it to the list of  energy types that qualify as a clean energy resource in SEA 178 for the purpose of energy  incentives. Natural gas has half the emissions as coal and is a cleaner burning fuel with  high efficiency and affordable pricing.  
The General Assembly also took up the topic of siting for energy generation projects  through several hearings in the Senate and House this year. In the end, important steps  were enacted on siting through SEA 425, which codified an energy utility’s ability to site traditional baseload generation on former and existing generation sites over 80 MW or former mining sites without usurping other local, state, and federal permits and laws. This  is very similar to a local ordinance enacted in Spencer County in 2024 related to a current generation facility and the potential for SMR development in the future. Given infrastructure is already located on these generation sites, they are ideal locations for  future investment, which means continued revenue for communities in which they are  located. Lawmakers also capped local moratoriums on projects to one year with the goal of  encouraging communities to set standards going forward while maintaining control over  zoning and other local requirements.  
Energy is the foundation of Indiana’s economic future. It demands recognition of the  unique challenges facing each community and a vision for what we want to become as a  state. As we look ahead, continued engagement between the Braun Administration,  policymakers, utilities, local leaders, and the business community is essential. But with the  momentum built this session, Indiana is well-positioned to lead on energy – just as we’ve  long led on manufacturing, innovation, and economic growth.

The GOP supermajority managed to mend fences and get along most of the year. And even though both the House and Senate left town early last week — an historically rare occurrence that is quickly becoming the norm — they still managed to send 49 bills to the governor’s desk, put two proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot and pass a $53 billion state budget. 
It wasn’t until the final week when the wheels came off, though this time the culprit was squabbles with Democrats. 
Republicans deployed a rarely-used procedural maneuver to cut off debate and pass bills seeking to repeal two voter-approved initiatives protecting abortion rights and increasing access to paid sick leave. The move effectively ended the session two days early and killed a litany of unrelated bills in the process. 
So who were the big winners and losers of the legislative session? 
 WINNERS

 Mike Kehoe

 Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe speaks to the media the morning after the legislative session’s end at the state Capitol on May 16 (Brian Munoz / St. Louis Public Radio).
Not everything went Mike Kehoe’s way during his first legislative session as governor. 
One of his appointments to the State Board of Education got spiked in the Senate, and he pushed his stadium funding plan so late in the session it will now require lawmakers to return to Jefferson City next month in a long-shot bid to pass it and prevent the Royals and Chiefs from moving to Kansas. 
But he got most of the big-ticket items he called for when he laid out his agenda in his first State of the State address in January, highlighted by a capital gains tax cut, state control of St. Louis police and a $50 million private school voucher program.
He also earned rave reviews from state lawmakers, who marveled at a governor actually leaving his office to work personally with the legislature. 
“We made it a priority to walk the halls, not just to meet with lawmakers, but to build relationships, have real discourse and understand what mattered most to the people they represent, because progress starts with relationships and open conversations,” Kehoe told reporters Friday.
The state’s budget may never be as rosy again, with federal funding in limbo and state revenues not keeping up with projections. And with tough fights over stadium funding in the near term and a mid-term election on the horizon, Kehoe’s honeymoon with the legislature could be short lived. 
Whether his first year as governor will be Kehoe’s high-water mark is anybody’s guess. But he undoubtedly just finished one of the best legislative sessions any governor has had in years. 
 Dirk Deaton

The pattern of crafting a state budget has become familiar over the years. 
The House works for months to get its budget plan in place, then the Senate basically rewrites everything before it gets sent to the governor. 
Lather. Rinse. Repeat. 
This year, House Budget Chairman Dirk Deaton certainly had to swallow a lot of spending he didn’t like. But he held firm and won passage of the governor’s $50 million private school voucher program that the Senate wanted to eliminate. 
Then, just hours before the constitutional deadline to finish work on the budget, and after the Senate had already gone home for the week, Deaton orchestrated the surprise death of a $500 million construction spending package — sinking projects for health care, education and law enforcement across the state and creating a bipartisan backlash that helped derail the governor’s stadium funding plan. 
The long-term consequences of Deaton’s move on the House’s relationship with the Senate still aren’t clear. But it solidified his reputation as a budget hawk willing to take extraordinary steps to keep state spending in check. 
 Senate Democrats

 Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck speaks about negotiations on a bill that seeks to establish a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The session certainly didn’t end the way Senate Democrats would have liked. 
Efforts to protect two voter-approved initiatives — an abortion rights constitutional amendment and a paid sick leave law — went up in flames when Republicans went nuclear and shut down debate to force repeal bills to a vote. 
The 10 Democrats in the 34-member Senate had already spent months watching a suddenly unified GOP supermajority eliminate taxes on capital gains, take control of the St. Louis police, ease regulations on utilities and implement new hurdles in the initiative petition process. 
Yet despite the inglorious ending and parade of GOP wins, Democrats were successful at ensuring no high-profile bill cleared the Senate this year without at least a few Democratic priorities tacked on. 
The capital gains tax cut also expanded a property tax credit for the elderly and disabled that has been a longstanding Democratic priority. And it included sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products. 
Democrats won additions to the St. Louis police bill banning the shackling of pregnant prisoners, establishing a fund for exonerated prisoners to receive restitution and limiting what jails and prisons can charge inmates for phone calls.
A bill allowing Missouri Farm Bureau to sell health plans also requires all health plans to cover extended supplies of birth control and expands access to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Next year’s legislative session may not be as fruitful for either party (see below). And it’s doubtful Democrats will look back at 2025 fondly. But the small-ball approach of making bills they hate a little less terrible scored the party some unexpected wins this year. 
 Utility corporations

For the first time in nearly 50 years, Missouri’s major electric utilities will be able to include the cost of new power plants in the rates customers pay for service.
Written specifically to encourage the construction of new natural gas-based generation, the new law could also be used to help finance a new nuclear power station. The law banning rates that include costs for construction work in progress was approved by voters in 1976 in response to the costs of the Callaway Energy Center, a 1,200 megawatt reactor near Fulton.
The utility companies employed “squadrons” of lobbyists to pass the bill, complained state Rep. Don Mayhew, a Republican from Crocker. But they stitched together bipartisan majorities in both the Missouri House and Senate, getting votes from 20 Democrats and 76 Republicans in the lower chamber as it was sent to Kehoe, who signed it.
Just days later, Evergy, a major power supplier in western Missouri, announced plans to construct a natural gas-fired power plant near Maryville.
 LOSERS

 The 2026 legislative session

The final day of the legislative session ended when Republicans deployed the “PQ,” a rule allowing leadership to cut off debate and force a vote over the objections of any senators trying to slow things down. 
The maneuver hasn’t been used by the Senate in five years. Before last week, the Senate had only used it 18 times since 1970. 
Democrats were furious, both because the GOP went nuclear after a session marked by negotiation and compromise and because they did so to roll back laws enacted by the voters just months earlier. 
Knowing Democrats’ response to the PQ would be to spend the final days of session using procedural hijinks of their own to muck up the process, Republicans adjourned for the year.
Senate leaders have historically been hesitant to utilize the PQ because it generates lasting bitterness — and sparks retaliation. And that’s exactly what Democrats promised as they were leaving town last week. 
The bad blood could spill into a special session next month for the governor’s stadium funding plan. But just as likely, it could lead to wall-to-wall gridlock when lawmakers return in January. 
“From this point forward…everything is going to be so hard around here,” said Senate Democratic Leader Doug Beck. “It’s going to be very hard.”
 Direct democracy

 Protestors hold up signs criticizing Missouri lawmakers’ recent votes to overturn ballot measures passed in 2024 during a rally on the Missouri Capitol steps on May 15 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Missouri voters in 2010 overwhelmingly enacted tougher standards on dog breeders in the hopes of eliminating the state’s reputation as the puppy-mill capital of America.
A few months later, lawmakers repealed the law and replaced it with a far less stringent version.
In the years since, the legislature repealed a nonpartisan redistricting plan enacted by initiative petition in 2020; refused to implement voter-approved Medicaid expansion until the state Supreme Court ordered it to in 2021; and this year repealed a paid sick leave law that 58% of voters enacted in November. 
Republicans also put a constitutional amendment banning abortion on the 2026 ballot, months after voters enshrined abortion rights in the Missouri Constitution. 
GOP lawmakers are quick to note that in the same elections that enacted all these policies, voters also put the GOP in control of every statewide office and sent a supermajority of the party to the legislature. 
And they contend voters were duped into supporting the proposals by well-financed campaigns.
“This is one of those things, of the problem with direct democracy,” state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, said earlier this year. “This is exactly what our founders were expressively against when they formed this nation.”
For Democrats and the activists who backed the initiative petitions, the reality is Republicans aren’t concerned about the will of the people. 
“They disrespect the voters,” Beck said. “They don’t care.”
 Bayer

When Bayer purchased St. Louis-based Monsanto in 2018, it inherited an avalanche of litigation alleging the key ingredient in its Roundup weed killer — glyphosate — causes cancer. 
The German pharmaceutical and biotechnology group has paid about $10 billion to settle Roundup claims, according to the Wall Street Journal, and still faces about 67,000 pending cases. 
Roughly 25,000 of those cases are in Missouri, since Bayer’s U.S. headquarters is in St. Louis. In 2023, a Cole County jury ordered the company to pay $1.56 billion to three plaintiffs, though a judge later reduced that to $622 million. 
The legal and financial peril has inspired the company to push legislation shielding itself from lawsuits alleging Roundup caused cancer. Two states — North Dakota and Georgia — have approved shield legislation. 
But the stakes in Missouri are especially high. 
A group tied to Bayer ran TV and radio ads in Missouri this year presenting glyphosate as a benign, beneficial chemical essential to modern agriculture that is at risk thanks to frivolous lawsuits. 
Legislative leaders, along with the governor, lined up in support of the shield legislation. 
The bill eked out of the House with barely enough votes to pass before running into a buzzsaw of opposition in the Senate. Leading the charge was the Senate Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans lawmakers who in recent years have enjoyed the financial backing of Missouri trial attorneys. 
The four-member Freedom Caucus’s effort to kill the Roundup bill was joined by five other Republican senators after they were targeted with a direct mail campaign claiming resistance to passing the bill was a betrayal of President Donald Trump’s fight against China. 
The rising opposition sealed the bill’s fate, and few expect it to fare any better next year. 
 David Wasinger

 Lt. Gov. David Wasinger watches the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The first-term GOP lieutenant governor didn’t mince words earlier this month when he decried how the Senate conducted itself while debating the state budget.
It is time for a change, Wasinger declared while presiding over the chamber, and he vowed to take a more active role in proceedings while also working to change the rules of the chamber. 
“Uh… no,” was the response from Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin. 
A lieutenant governor doesn’t have any of that power. Wasinger was out of line giving a speech in the Senate chambers in the first place, O’Laughlin said, because that is “a right reserved for senators.”
Soon after the kerfuffle, Republican state Sen. Jason Bean of Holcomb demanded Senate staff — both partisan and nonpartisan — be directed by leadership not to participate in any efforts by Wasinger to influence the rules or process. 
The next week, with Wasinger presiding, senators began making complicated procedural motions that appeared to befuddle the lieutenant governor. In the confusion, he incorrectly called for a vote on a bill too early, and when he tried to walk everything back left the Senate briefly paralyzed as staff worked to sort things out. 
Wasinger presided for a few more minutes before leaving the dais and sending a letter to Senate leaders informing them he would be absent the rest of the week.

(Photo courtesy of Ballah)As the conclusion of my undergraduate education approached, my post-graduate plans grew increasingly unclear. Financial uncertainty and the late realization that I might have chosen the “wrong” major led me to believe that pursuing a master’s degree was no longer a feasible option. The onset of the 2008 recession and tightening job market only heightened my anxiety about the future. However, as the first in my family to graduate from college, I was determined to quickly overcome the first adult-sized hurdle in my path.
During a pre-graduation conversation with my now father-in-law, I expressed doubts and anxiety about my compatibility with – and interest in – the career options available to someone with just a bachelor’s degree in psychology. This conversation provided some of the most honest, timely, and impactful career advice. I was encouraged to focus on my personal interests and passions, while being reminded that my degree was only a foundation — and that a strong résumé and credible professional references were paramount to achieving career success and mobility.
It was during this conversation that I first learned about AmeriCorps. The program presented the opportunity – and breathing room – that I needed: A way to defer student loan payments without accruing interest, earn an education award to support future academic pursuits or pay down existing student loans, and gain valuable on-the-job experience, professional training and certifications, and exposure to career fields aligned with my interests and passions.

With renewed focus, I began reviewing AmeriCorps programs and submitting applications. One program stood out above the rest: the Maryland Conservation Corps (MCC), managed through the Department of Natural Resources’ Maryland Park Service. The program blended my personal interests with foundational job skills I already possessed, while providing extensive training opportunities to help members advance their careers. Immediately, my anxiety began to wane.
Growing up, my family regularly recreated in state parks, hiked sections of the Appalachian Trail, and fostered a deep appreciation for the environment. However, I had never considered a career within this professional umbrella. My two terms as an MCC crew member changed that.
I gained essential job skills — like trail construction and interpretive programming — and honed talents such as carpentry and equipment operation. Just as importantly, I grew in confidence, learned to navigate challenges and began to see my potential more clearly.
The crew members I served have become long-term friends, and the career employees who mentored me became my professional “Mount Rushmore,” demonstrating the importance of intangible qualities such as trust, respect, and accountability. Regular interactions with park visitors further inspired me. I witnessed the joy of inspiring others to care, watched elementary school students and adults introspectively weigh their daily decisions against their environmental impact, and served as an ambassador for Maryland’s diverse natural, cultural, historical and recreational resources.
Since 2011, I have proudly served Maryland citizens as a classified State Park Ranger at several properties, promoting up through the ranks to my current position as a Park Manager. Humbly, I recognize that my career has had highlights – but I would not be where I am without my experience as an MCC crew member. That is a stated fact: without the training, certifications, and on-the-job experience gained during those two years, I would not have built the résumé needed to meet the minimum qualifications for an entry-level ranger position.
Our agency and state are now at a critical juncture due to federal budgetary decisions hampering AmeriCorps’ ability to operate. The human element is incomprehensible. Forty-one resolute, passionate, and hopeful employees were told they could no longer serve as AmeriCorps volunteers, and now their livelihoods and futures are in doubt. Mission-critical agency functions have paused indefinitely. Inspiration, promise, and individual creativity have been stifled. The effective farm team has been put out to pasture, and park professionals across the state are asking: “Why?”
I also wonder: Where would I be now if this had happened to me while I was serving as a crew member? I certainly would not be managing Fair Hill NRMA and Bohemia River State Park or serving as president of the Maryland Rangers Association. That realization saddens me deeply, and it comes with another ponderance: How many future park rangers, educators and positive influencers just had their careers taken from them before they even had a chance to begin?
We need to continue asking “why.” The dedicated members of the MCC deserve it. The classified staff of the Department of Natural Resources deserve it. And every citizen of the State of Maryland deserves it.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_6968-cropped-e1746485657221-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 07:07:15.349066

The Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature abruptly ended its 2025 session early last week to guarantee passage of two bills to undo what a majority of Missourians had voted for.
Were they working for what was in Missouri’s best interest, or falling in line with the national Republican agenda?
The day before the legislature ended its session Missouri lost a giant, Christopher ‘Kit’ Bond, who as an elected official aways chose what was best for Missouri over being a Republican who blindly pushed a partisan agenda at the exclusion of input from his Democratic colleagues, or the concerns of his constituents.
The legislature’s preoccupation to pass those two bills provides damning evidence of how partisan politics have come to rule the day. Legislators used a procedure to prevent Democrats from raising any objections or providing input and successfully secured their passage.
Also, the majority of Missourians be damned.
One bill puts a new abortion ban amendment before voters in 2026, unless the governor doesn’t decide to do it sooner.
The second takes away paid sick leave from Missouri workers that voters passed overwhelmingly and had just taken effect May 1. Those benefits will now be snatched back from workers on Aug. 28.
Both issues, through the petition initiative process, were decisively decided by voters last November.
A majority of Missourians voted against an abortion ban.
A majority of Missourians voted for paid sick leave.
Pause for a moment and think about what is being pushed about those same two issues on the national level by Republicans, irrespective of what the majority of Americans has indicated they prefer.
When it comes to abortion, the budget bill moving through Congress diverts and defunds agencies like Planned Parenthood, targeting “Big Abortion” as it is being called.
When it comes to paid leave, the United States is one of the few countries in the world that doesn’t have a national paid family leave policy. A bipartisan bill to establish such a policy was recently introduced, which will require state participation. But its fate remains to be seen.
Bills to increase the federal minimum wage have repeatedly failed to be passed by Congress. The current proposed bill is unlikely to pass. Missouri voters have raised the minimum wage three times, including in November to $15 an hour.
What other measures were left on the table that could have benefited many Missourians because of tacit or implicit support of the national Republican agenda?
A major bill, House bill 19 that addressed many needs in communities across Missouri,  expected to be considered was suddenly refused to be presented for a vote in the House.
Needed areas left unfunded included: rural hospitals, community health centers, Boys and Girls clubs, capital improvement projects, higher education, research programs, workforce development, construction of a 200-bed mental hospital and other infrastructure projects.
Meanwhile, billions of dollars remain in a surplus fund.
There was one other area that Missouri Republican lawmakers focused on that aligns, reinforces and support the national Republican agenda.
Tax cuts. Tax breaks.
Republican lawmakers managed to pass their biggest tax-cut priority bill and forwarded it to the governor for signing. The bill allows capital gains exemptions for individuals and corporations.
The bill also provides some limited tax breaks for low income, seniors and the disabled.
Passing a major tax cut is also a high priority for Congress. The current bill contains a permanent tax-cut for the richest 1% as well as targeted breaks for millions of Americans, although they are temporary for some, like the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime pay which will expire in 2028.
While seniors may be eligible for a new deduction, there will be no tax break or tax cut on social security income.
Moving forward, however, the challenge remains: How do we get our elected public officials to rise above entrenched partisan politics and selfish interests and focus instead on those areas that will improve the lives of most Missourians.
Elected officials’ only job is to work for those who elected them.
Republicans at the state and national level seem hell bent on pushing a blindly partisan agenda at the expense of what is best for their state or the country, and the will of the people.

They would do well to reflect on the life of Kit Bond, a stellar public servant and lifelong Republican.
Hopefully, it will be a reminder for some and a lesson for others.
As governor and U.S. senator, Bond was an elected official who worked to address the needs of all Missourians. The issues and legislation he championed were not marred by intractable and extreme partisan politics.
He worked with Republicans and Democrats.
During his long career — in life and the tributes pouring in since his death, from fellow Republicans and Democrats alike — his integrity and commitment to be collaborative to address the challenges that Missouri faced, to arrive at workable solutions, to get the resources needed can be seen in communities across the state.
His impact will be seen and benefit generations of Missourians for years to come.
In this time of hyper partisan politics, and when state needs and interests are co-opted and loss in a national agenda, it would serve current lawmakers well, to look to how Kit Bond functioned.
He epitomized what it means to put the interests of Missouri and Missourians first.
He was committed to get what was needed done.

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin’s Republicans urged party members to put aside their differences over the weekend, saying that unity will be necessary if they want to win the 2026 elections for governor, Congress and the state Legislature.
The state party reflected on recent elections as they met in Rothschild, Wisconsin. Many of the state’s top Republicans delivered glowing reviews of Trump’s first few months in office and celebrated Wisconsin’s role in helping reelect him. 
“We are seeing President Trump honor the promises he made,” U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said. “That was made possible because of people like you that delivered the 10 electoral votes to President Trump of Wisconsin.”
Despite Trump carrying the state in November, the state party is reeling from recent losses.
Johnson called the April Wisconsin Supreme Court election “stinging” and a “crushing defeat.” 
Republicans’ preferred candidate Brad Schimel lost his bid for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court  by nearly 10 percentage points, solidifying a liberal majority on the Court at least until 2027. It was the third Supreme Court  election in a row that conservatives lost after  Dan Kelly was defeated by double digits in both 2020 and 2023. The Republican-endorsed candidate for the spring state Superintendent race, Brittany Kinser, also lost in April. Kinser, a school choice advocate, thanked the party for its help at the convention. 
“There’s no way you can sugarcoat that,” Johnson said. 
Johnson said the results were because of “voters who came out to try and save America by electing Donald Trump” but didn’t come out to vote in April to “ensure that [Trump] would have four years where he could implement his agenda without possibly the majority shifting in the House.” He said the party needs to work to get voters out in non-presidential elections. , especially as Trump is in his second term and is barred from running again by the U.S. Constitution.
“As much as many would want Donald Trump to be on the ballot again, he won’t be. He won’t be, and we’re going to figure out how we win, but without Donald Trump on the ballot here in Wisconsin, so that’s just a hard truth,” Johnson said.
Following the April losses, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chair Brian Schimming came under scrutiny by some party members who blamed him for the results. Some at the convention circulated a paper seeking a vote of no confidence in Schimming though the effort never came to fruition. 
Fights within county parties have also broken out since the April elections. Those divisions were on display at the convention as some from a local county party sought to keep Kelly Ruh, the party treasurer and one of the people to serve as a fake elector for Trump in 2020, from being seated as a delegate. Her supporters said it was “absurd” that members of the party would seek to block their own treasurer from voting, while others said she shouldn’t be seated because to do so would subvert the vote taken by the county party. The full convention voted to seat her anyway. 
“There’s always power struggles,” Johnson, who declined to take sides in any fights, said. “But I have to admit in the 15 years since I entered the political process, I’ve never seen as many squabbles.” 
Johnson warned that the party won’t be able to win if Republicans are  “disunified.” 
U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden echoed Johnson’s calls for unity, saying that people didn’t vote because Republicans were fighting. 
“If I hear one more person, say, RINO [an acronym for Republican in Name Only], you’re gonna get the horn,” Van Orden said. “Knock it off. We are Republicans who are Americans who are patriots. We love our country. We love our families. We love our communities.” 
Wisconsin RNC Chairman Terry Dittrich said Republicans need to up their game and don’t have time to waste ahead of 2026. 
“We stop the infighting. We start working together. We welcome the youth in. We pay attention to our goal… to make sure President Trump can finish his job in four years and go on with JD Vance for another four years and another four years and another four years,” Dittrich said. “Let’s all unify.”
State Treasurer John Leiber is leading an effort to examine the recent losses — a job he was assigned by Schimming. At the convention, Leiber cautioned party members against “pointing fingers” at others. 
“That doesn’t help anyone… What I’m focused on is how we can use that experience, learn from it and figure out how to win in 2026,” Leiber said. 
Lieber said his committee is working to gather information and data to understand ways of making progress, and he asked attendees to fill out a handout to provide feedback. He noted that he is up for reelection in 2026. 
“I want to win, so I don’t have any reason to try to smooth things over or sugarcoat. If anything I want to identify what exactly we need to do, what we can do better, how we do it better, and identify the ways that we can all work together to accomplish our goal, which is of course winning,” Leiber said. 
Schimming said that the party has to be honest about the April elections and the frustration about them. But he said Republicans need to focus and move forward to win the next election. 
“Doesn’t mean we agree on everything. Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t change tactics or strategies, but it means we gotta look forward… We’re gonna work together. We’re gonna listen. We’re going to lead. We’re going to lead, and we’re going to do what it takes to win. We won the country last November and saved America. Next year, we can save Wisconsin,” Schimming said. 
2026 gubernatorial, legislative and Supreme Court elections 
The calls for unity come during an off year for Wisconsin elections but also as crucial gubernatorial and state legislative races lie ahead in November 2026. A race for the state Supreme Court will also take place in April with Justice Rebecca Bradley up for reelection,  though that race, which won’t tip the ideological balance of the Court, wasn’t a  prominent focus at the convention. 
Gov. Tony Evers has yet to decide whether he will run for a third term, but Republicans are intent on putting a Republican in office, whether that means ousting Evers or defeating another Democratic candidate. So far, only one Republican, Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann, has launched his campaign for the office. 
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany is also considering a run for governor and spent the majority of his time on stage at the convention taking jabs at Evers.
“The question — as we have this great reset led by President Trump — is will Wisconsin be one of the winners?” Tiffany said. “Will Wisconsin be one of the winners like Texas and South Dakota, Tennessee, Florida? States like that are winning, people are moving to those states, businesses are growing, people want to be there. Are we going to be one of those states or are we going to be like the losers in Illinois and Minnesota?” 
“We all know what the problems are. The question is how are we going to fix it?” Tiffany said. “We can fix it easily by replacing Tony Evers in 2026.”
U.S. Rep. Tony Wied from Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District said Republicans  need to keep up  their momentum into the next year, and in the race for governor the “fight starts right now” and can’t wait.
“We have a governor who refuses to even say the word mother,” Wied said, referring to Evers’ proposal to update language in state laws related to infertility treatments, “who fights the Trump administration at every single turn, who would rather protect illegal aliens than hard-working Wisconsinites.  
State Rep. Mark Born (R-Spring Green) and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) were also critical of Evers during a panel discussion. Born said he introduced a “ridiculous budget again” that included “reckless spending,” and “massive policy trying to rewrite everything that’s happened in the state in the last more than a decade now.” LeMahieu said that Evers is trying to “turn us into Minnesota, turn us into Illinois — states that have out of control spending.”
“If you could think of a dumb idea for government, the governor probably had it in his budget,” Born said. 
Lawmakers said it would be essential they keep control of the Senate and Assembly to continue to stop Democrats’ agenda.
Running under new legislative maps in 2024, Republican lawmakers lost 14 state legislative seats in the last elections — leaving them with slimmer majorities in the Senate and Assembly. In 2026, Democrats are seeking to flip the Assembly, which currently has a 54-45 Republican majority, and the Senate, which currently has an 18-15 Republican majority. 
“We’re going to be up against it this next year, but we’re out there fighting, knocking on doors. We are the firewall against really horrible liberal policies coming into Wisconsin,” LeMahieu said. 
The Senate will be particularly crucial as it will be the first time the new district lines are in place for the half of the seats up for election. While addressing the convention, former Gov. Tommy Thompson said some have been telling him that they are afraid they will lose the state Senate.
“Don’t even think that way,” Thompson said. “We are winners, not losers. We’re going to campaign. We are going to unite… and we’re going to win.” 
Trump’s agenda 
Republicans were complimentary of Trump’s first few months in office, including his efforts to detain and deport noncitizens, bar transgender people from certain spaces, eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and cut investments in social programs. 
Wied said the border is “more secure than at any other point in history.” 
“Trump is doing what he said he would do. Under President Trump and Republican leadership, illegal immigrants will no longer be given a free pass in this country,” Wied said. “If you break the law, you are going to face consequences.”
“Isn’t it great that border crossings are going down and deportations are going up?” Tiffany asked. “Isn’t it great to live in America like that?
Johnson was not completely on board with everything Trump is doing, expressing concern about the cost of the so-called “big beautiful bill” Trump is working to get through Congress, which using the budget reconciliation process to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase funding for immigration enforcement, expand work requirements for food assistance and cut Medicaid costs by implementing work requirements.
“The big, beautiful bill isn’t what it’s advertised to be,” Johnson said. “We’re not going to be bending the debt curve down. We would be exacerbating the problem by a total of about $4 trillion over the next 10 years.” 
Splitting from Johnson, Van Orden said that Republicans should also be united on Trump’s bill.
“We don’t need grandstanders in the Republican party — stop talking and get it done,” Van Orden said, echoing Trump.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina delivered a keynote address to the convention, praising Trump for his immigration policies and his efforts to stop transgender women from participating on women’s sports teams. Mace is known for seeking to bar transgender people from certain spaces, including bathrooms, locker rooms, and targeting her Democratic transgender colleague in the House of Representatives and other transgender individuals. 
“I like an immigration policy kind of how I like my sweet tea — with a lot of ICE,” Mace said, playing on the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“There has never been a president stronger than Donald Trump. They impeached him. They raided his home. They indicted him. They even shot him, and the man still survived. He stood tall. We prayed for him every single time, because no weapon formed against him shall ever prosper,” Mace said. “Trump is back. He’s securing the border. He’s deporting illegals. He’s protecting women’s sports, and he’s declaring there are only two genders, and DEI under Donald J Trump is DOA.” 
Mace, who noted she’s considering running for governor of South Carolina in the future, took her comments further telling convention goers that the U.S. is in a battle. 
“It’s not necessarily a battle between the parties or left and right or ideology. It is a battle between good and between evil, and we cannot allow this evil to win,” Mace said.

Idaho’s canceled grants were among over $12 billion dollars in federal grants the Trump administration terminated following Trump’s directive. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, terminated the grants to Idaho’s state health department, and other state and local health departments.
An HHS spokesperson said the funds were largely used for COVID-related efforts — including COVID testing, vaccination and global projects. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects to save $11.4 billion, the spokesperson told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the HHS spokesperson said. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun that all the canceled grants “are all pandemic related funding that provided a one-time infusion.”
About $29 million of Idaho’s canceled grants were focused on vaccines for children. Almost $13.3 million of Idaho’s canceled grants were focused on mental health. Another $6.9 million grant was for substance abuse.

Idaho spent about $25.8 million of the canceled grants. The federal government had paid Idaho nearly that same amount through the grants so far, HHS’s data shows. 
HHS terminated Idaho’s grants on March 24, according to HHS’s public list of all canceled grants. 
The grants’ cancellation does not affect ongoing Idaho health programs, McWhorter said. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is “executing its exit strategies to minimize any disruptions for the one-time pandemic grants,” he said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)After a week at the state Capitol to draw attention to their demand for a robust state fund for child care providers, advocates will spend the next couple of weeks back home to amplify their message.
Child care centers will reopen this week after closing their doors for all or part of the past week as providers sought to underscore the urgency of additional support for child care.
Providers will focus on raising more awareness in their local communities, said Corrine Hendrickson, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), a coalition of providers and parents. Federal pandemic relief money that has bolstered providers since 2021 will run out completely by early July.

This week, WECAN is encouraging providers to do “larger [local] community actions to help inform the community,” Hendrickson told the Wisconsin Examiner. “We’re also going to be calling other child care programs, making sure they even know this funding’s ending.”
WECAN organized the week of action in Madison, calling it “State Without Child Care.”
A small group of providers shut down for the week to dramatize the loss of child care that they contend will be inevitable without strong state support. Others closed for a day or two, and still others opted to stay open while also endorsing the funding demand.
Earlier this month leaders of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed a $480 million child care funding provision from Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed 2025-27 state budget, along with more than 600 other items.
On Friday, Hendrickson and WECAN cofounder Brooke Legler were joined by parents and other providers in front of the Capitol to reiterate their case for restoring the funds.

“My family still currently pays 25% of our monthly income towards child care, and honestly that’s just after-school care and then summer camps,” said Katy Dicks of Sun Prairie, who has a 10-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son. When the children were younger, child care accounted for a third of the family’s income, she said — while “it has been suggested that 7% of a family’s income is what is affordable.”
Dicks leads the Wisconsin chapter of Mother Forward, a national advocacy group for child care, paid family leave and other policies to support families.
“We need policy that works for all families,” she said. “The quality of care for children approximately 3 months to 5 years should not be based on a child’s parents’ income.”
Also at the Capitol were Rochelle Navin and her husband. They have a 2-year-old daughter, and Navin is expecting twins. Their daughter is usually at Legler’s New Glarus child care center, The Growing Tree, while her parents work, but they juggled home care arrangements to support Legler’s decision to close the center for the week.
Navin told the Wisconsin Examiner it was disruptive to their routine, but the couple understood why Legler took that step.

“There’s two sides of it, right?” Navin said. “You fully understand why it’s gotten to this point, and why the extreme [response] needed to be taken, while at the same time being scared about what the future looks like.”
Evers’ proposal was to extend the Child Care Counts program, originally funded by federal pandemic relief money. The subsidy — originally $20 million a month, then cut back to $10 million a month in mid-2023 — enabled providers to raise wages without having to increase the fees parents pay for care.
A statewide survey conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institute for Research on Poverty found that 25% of providers said they might close if the revenue isn’t replaced.
Hendrickson said in the coming weeks she and other providers who have been active in campaigning for the support will reach out to operators with messaging guidance for talking to parents as well as to their local lawmakers.
“This week was definitely about coming together as a group in solidarity and really standing up for ourselves and for our children and our families and our communities,” Hendrickson said Friday.
Over the course of the week at the Capitol, “we visited almost every single office, dropped off information, talked to staffers and really helped them see who it is that they’re hurting,” she said.
The providers who engaged in those conversations also aimed to show legislators “that their constituents actually know what they’re talking about — we know what we’re talking about with our businesses, we can speak to it and the reason why we need the funding, and it’s not a handout,” Hendrickson added.
In the Institute for Research on Poverty study, up to 40% of rural providers said they might close if the additional funding stops. That’s  nearly twice the projected closure rate of urban providers.
Brynne Schieffer operates a child care program in the community of Cameron, near Rice Lake in Northwestern Wisconsin.
“I have spent the entirety of my adult life caring for not only my own children, but other people’s children, raising them, raising them to be kind human beings that will hopefully one day go out and be carers themselves,” Schieffer told the group gathered on the Capitol steps Friday.
“The funding runs out in July, and to avoid closure we have to raise our rates between $35 and $50 per child per week. Whose pocketbook can handle that?”
Hendrickson told the Wisconsin Examiner that if rural providers have to raise their rates, they’re more likely to lose families who can’t afford the increase, with no one to replace them. In cities, she said, moderate- and low-income families will be hurt by the loss of child care, but there are likely to be more high-income families able to keep up with rising costs, so fewer providers would have to close.
All but one of the providers who made the trip to Madison last week were from rural communities around the state, Hendrickson said.
“People drove four or five hours to get here,” she said. “It’s because they don’t feel listened to [back in their districts]. And that’s what they said — ‘I’ve had to come all the way down here to get them to listen to me.’”

(Photos provided by the Beech Grove Police Department and Ritchie's legal team)Beech Grove police officer William “Bill” Toney wasn’t supposed to be on the clock that Friday night in September 2000. 
It was a cool, autumn day in the south Indianapolis suburb. At home, Toney had just finished dinner with his wife, Dee Dee, and close friends — a weekly tradition. 
They lingered for a while afterward, watching Jeopardy before Toney headed into work.
Friends said Toney had agreed to a favor — covering the final hour of a fellow officer’s shift so the colleague could leave town early for a family trip. Toney didn’t have to go in, “but he was selfless,” recalled Robert Mercuri, who was a sergeant and supervisor in charge on the night of the killing.
“Bill was the kind of police officer that everyone always describes when they say, ‘This is how we want our police officers to be like,” he said.
As Toney got dressed for duty, Dee Dee helped tuck in his shirt, like she always did. 
“He had to be perfect — he was a neat freak,” said Jeff Horen, Dee Dee’s brother-in-law, and a close friend of Toney’s. “Everything had to be done just right. He put towels down on his floor mats in his car to keep his floor mats perfect. He cared about doing things the right way.”
Just hours before Toney’s 32nd birthday, a call came in about a white Chevy Astro van, stolen from a gas station in Beech Grove.










Sometimes, I wonder if we lose sight of who the real victim in this situation is.


– Beech Grove Deputy Police Chief Robert Mercuri


Around 9:30 p.m. Sept. 29, he joined two fellow officers in the pursuit and chased the van until it crashed in a residential neighborhood at the 700 block of Churchman Avenue
When the van crashed and two suspects fled, Toney pursued one — 20-year-old Benjamin Ritchie — through a dark maze of houses and fences.
Minutes into the chase, Ritchie stopped running, cornered in a backyard on Fletcher Lane. He crouched behind a house and waited for Toney to clear a fence. He fired four times as the officer came into view. 
One bullet missed Toney’s bullet-proof vest by an inch, striking the officer in the lower neck. Toney was able to return fire once but missed Ritchie.
A nearby homeowner who sat alongside the mortally-wounded officer while awaiting help later recalled in court that Toney — who could not speak — twirled his wedding band in his fingers as he took his last breaths.
“I found my friend Bill lying on the ground in that backyard. I attempted CPR. I rode with him in the ambulance … praying the entire time that he would survive,” said Mercuri, who was involved in the initial vehicle pursuit and was among the first to render aid after the shooting. “But my experience told me he was already gone.”
The officer was later pronounced dead at Wishard Memorial Hospital.
“Instead of being able to plan for a birthday celebration for Bill, due to the cowardly acts of a selfish punk, Dee Dee was planning Bill’s funeral,” said Molly Winters, herself a widow of a fallen Muncie police officer and a longtime leader and advocate within Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS), a national nonprofit that supports families and coworkers of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. 
Ritchie, who was on probation for burglary, was arrested in a nearby house several hours later after a search that involved more than 100 officers from multiple agencies. He was charged with murder, car theft and resisting law enforcement, among other charges. On Oct. 15, 2002, he was sentenced to death.
Nearly 25 years after the killing, the state is hours away from carrying out Ritchie’s death sentence. He’s scheduled to be executed by lethal injection just after midnight Tuesday. 
Republican Gov. Mike Braun, following a unanimous recommendation from Indiana’s Parole Board, rejected the inmate’s clemency plea last week.
“If we as a society don’t stand up for those who protect us, then who will stand up and support them?” asked Mercuri. “Sometimes, I wonder if we lose sight of who the real victim in this situation is.”
A ‘model’ officer — and a ‘loving’ dad
Just days before the fatal police chase, Toney sat on the soccer field sidelines outside the St. Francis Hospital campus on the south side of Indianapolis.
On the field was his oldest daughter, Jessica, just four years old.
Horen remembered being with the Toney family that Wednesday evening.
“Jessica was really shy, and Bill was completely freaked out that she wasn’t getting down on that field by herself,” Horen recalled last week during his clemency hearing testimony. 
“He went out and held her hand. She played, she smiled. We talked afterward, and it was like this big sigh of relief,” Horen continued. “I’m not sure whose smile was bigger. Was it Jessica’s, or was it his?”
‘A monster running loose in the countryside.’ Clemency hearings end for Indiana death row inmate

Toney’s family and friends described him as a dedicated officer, widely respected for his calm demeanor, compassion and “commitment to service.” 
He was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and joined the Beech Grove Police Department in 1995 after serving as a Marion County sheriff’s deputy. During his five years with the department, Toney earned a reputation for his professionalism and fairness. 
“He would call dads when the teenage kids were misbehaving … just trying to make life better in his community,” Horen said, before retelling a ride-along with Toney.
“I was riding with him one night. We pulled a guy over who was driving foolishly. He was about a block from his home. We saw him. I got out of the car, and Bill goes out, and he’s like, ‘What are you doing, man?’ And he’s like, ‘I just live right there.’ And he’s pointing at the house,” Horen recalled. “Bill said, ‘Drive your car to that driveway right now. We’re going to come back here repeatedly the rest of the night. If that car has moved, you’re going to jail. But if you stay inside, and go to bed, I’ll catch you a break.'”
“He didn’t want to ruin lives,” Horen continued. “He wanted to protect his community when it helped us. He wanted to help people.”
In emotional testimonies, Toney’s family and friends painted Richie as a remorseless killer who showed “repeated disrespect” during his trial.
Winters recalled that Richie was “rude, belligerent and obnoxious” throughout the trial. She noted that during the victim impact statement by Toney’s widow, Ritchie was so disruptive that the judge threatened to use duct tape to silence him.
Horen highlighted Ritchie’s “trophy tattoo” on his neck — of the number 37, a reference to Toney’s police unit number, with a lightning bolt between the digits — visible on the first day of the trial.

“He turned his head, looked at me, and he wasn’t sorry then, and he’s still not sorry,” said Beth; Toney’s sister, at a May 12 clemency hearing. 
At the 2002 sentencing hearing, while Dee Dee read her victim impact statement, she was repeatedly interrupted by Ritchie, who laughed and later called her a “b**ch” when she said Ritchie was a coward.
Despite Richie’s recent apology before the state’s parole board, “he has never addressed this to anyone in our family,” Toney’s sister said.
“He has never used the words ‘I’m sorry,” she told the clemency panel. “And he has yet to acknowledge that it was more than just ‘a lady’ and two children who have been affected. Families, friends and colleagues are just a few groups that come to mind.”
“Bill is forever gone,” she added. “I ask that my brother be honored as the hero he is, and to carry out the execution sentence to the murderer who has never shown remorse, nor apologized, for the choices he has made.”
Ritchie’s life scarred by ‘trauma,’ abandonment
Court documents, trial records and recent clemency hearing testimony paint a different picture for Ritchie, who in the days before the shooting was living in an Ohio motel and evading charges from an earlier, recent carjacking in Indiana. 
In court testimony, witnesses described Ritchie’s “volatile” behavior in the days and hours before the shooting — he had threatened people with a gun, fired it inside a hotel room, and talked about coming to Indianapolis to fight another man over a personal dispute. 
Ritchie and his group were reportedly drinking and using drugs at that time, too.
Around 7 p.m. on the night of Sept. 29, 2000, Ritchie — along with a man from Ohio, Michael Greer — stole a van from a Speedway gas station in Beech Grove. He armed himself with a stolen 9mm Glock, and according to court testimony, planned to commit an armed robbery. 
Police later found wigs and masks in the wrecked van and in nearby bushes, which authorities said were intended as disguises for the planned robbery.
“That night … was a train that left the station with no brakes, and multiple bad decisions led to losing the life of a man that should be here today,” Ritchie told Indiana’s Parole Board earlier this month. 
He said that on the night of the incident, he was with a group trying to steal rims from car dealers. They took a van and parked it at an apartment complex. When they went back to get the van, a police officer pulled in behind them. 
“Everything sped up then. It was like if you had a fast-forward button on a movie, and you hit the button, everything sped out of control,” Ritchie said.
“I ended up hitting and killing him. That’s something I have to live with every day. I wish I could take that back,” Ritchie continued, crying. “I don’t blame him. He was doing his job. I should have never been in a stolen car. I should never have had a gun. I should have just did the right thing when I got out.”
Story continues below.
Ritchie Clemency Public FIlings
 
Ritchie was born into what his clemency attorneys described as “unrelenting trauma.” 
His biological mother, Marion, drank heavily throughout her pregnancy — even more than she did while pregnant with his two older brothers, according to her own sworn testimony.
Her drinking and drug use was corroborated by family members and experts during Ritchie’s sentencing, and again during recent clemency hearings. 
Multiple witnesses, including family and neighbors, recalled seeing Marion visibly intoxicated “every day,” sometimes staggering drunk in public or passed out. One witness told the sentencing jury, “Every day that I would see her, she would be pretty drunk, and I would tell her, ‘stop it.’ It didn’t do any good.”
As a child, Ritchie was frequently unattended. Confined to his crib, he was “left choking on marijuana and cigarette smoke,” his attorneys wrote in recent clemency filings. 
“While Marion ignored Ben’s cries, her friends changed Ben’s diapers, bought him clothes, and fed him,” lawyers continued. “Marion left Ben with anyone who would take him — sometimes leaving an infant Ben on front porches to wait alone for the door to open.” 
Richie was later sent to live with Marion’s sister, Brenda, who lived in “a filthy house with no food.” Brenda’s husband was reportedly physically and verbally abusive towards Ritchie.
Although reluctant, Marion’s sister, Verna, ultimately took Ritchie in shortly before his second birthday, becoming his adoptive mom.
‘I am so sorry’: Clemency hearings begin for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Verna provided “a much more stable home life,” Ritchie’s lawyers said, but “the damage was already done.” 
“Prenatal exposure to alcohol permanently damaged Ben’s brain, setting him up for a lifetime of brain-based impairments,” the defense team wrote. “Then, the neglect and abuse Ben suffered in his early years further damaged his already constrained ability to regulate emotion.”
Ritchie’s intense anger issues and tantrums began around age three, according to his clemency application. 
“Ben remembers episodes of rage as a child where he destroyed his toys,” his lawyers said. “After each episode when the rage cleared, Ben was left to cry over the broken pieces of things he loved.”
When he started school, Ritchie’s behavior and classwork “were a constant challenge.” Teachers referred him for evaluations every year due to “problematic behaviors.”
At age 10, in the 4th grade, he was admitted to Community Hospital North for a six-week in-patient psychiatric stay. While there, he attempted suicide and told hospital staff he felt like “everyone would be better off if I were dead.” 
Ritchie was diagnosed as “seriously emotionally handicapped,” medical records show. Back at school, he received special education services until he dropped out altogether in 9th grade.
“Given my experiences with Ben as an adolescent, (Toney’s killing) was the exact type of situation where those severe emotional disabilities became fully evident and engaged,” said John Mast, a former special education teacher who worked with Ritchie for more than three years starting in the early 1990s. “He did not have the emotional tools, he did not have the skills, to make a different and acceptable decision.”
By the time he turned 20, before the fatal shooting, Ritchie had been in and out of the juvenile system and had racked up a string of criminal offenses. 
According to court records and his defense team, he struggled with untreated mental illness, impaired judgment and limited impulse control.

Experts testified during his trial and post-conviction hearings that Ritchie’s neurological and psychological impairments made him prone to impulsive, self-destructive decisions — including the one that ended Toney’s life.
Ritchie’s current lawyers point to his recently formalized diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) as shedding critical new light on his behavior — evidence they say was never fully presented to the jury that sentenced him to death. 
While Ritchie’s trial included testimony about his mother’s heavy drinking during pregnancy and his cognitive deficits, the specific FASD diagnosis was not identified until years later by experts using updated clinical standards.
Ritchie’s legal team contends the disorder left him with brain damage that impairs impulse control, judgment, and decision-making — factors they believe should have mitigated his culpability and now warrant a commuted sentence, or at least a new opportunity to present evidence in court.
“FASD is both cause and effect of the crime,” Ritchie’s defense attorney, Steve Schutte, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
He said the case “started and ended at the same spot because of the mistakes made” by Ritchie’s earlier, “ineffective” defense counsel who failed to present Ritchie’s FASD diagnosis at trial or in post-conviction proceedings.
Attempts by the Capital Chronicle to reach Ritchie’s previous lawyers were unsuccessful.
“Nothing presented saying that Ben does have brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other neurotoxins,” Schutte said. “That’s important … we now know that FASD not only helps mitigate the crime, it helps explain the crime.”
Since being sentenced to death in 2002, Ritchie has spent more than two decades on Indiana’s death row. 
Ritchie told the state’s five-member parole board that he “would never hurt anybody again,” and that he’s “never attacked” a correctional officer, “not one time.” He admitted, however, to having past issues with other inmates.

Prison records show at least 43 disciplinary conduct reports, including threats against staff, assaults on inmates, and possession of a six-inch shank. In one incident, he told a guard he hoped his next victim would be a Black female officer. In another, he was caught coughing on staff after testing positive for COVID-19. And last December, prison officials say Ritchie asked a correctional officer to procure methamphetamine for him.
His attorneys, however, cited numerous positive interactions in prison — like mentoring other inmates and writing poetry — as signs of his reform. During incarceration, he’s learned to cut hair and give others tattoos. Ritchie said he uses those skills as opportunities to talk to younger inmates.
Through a prison program allowing inmates to adopt animals, Ritchie additionally found companionship in a shelter cat named Cletus.
“Ben loves animals. He’s enamored with their cuteness, their ingenuity, and their unique personalities. His cell is covered in wall hangings depicting horses, buffalo, and wolves — animals he likely encountered in his beloved Western novels,” his lawyers said. “Through his relationship with Cletus, Ben was finally able to experience the unconditional love absent from his tumultuous childhood.”
Ritchie said he “didn’t take credit” for his actions for years and “was in a dark hole.” But since receiving mental health counseling in prison, he’s learned “coping mechanisms” and “gotten control” of himself.
“I’m just not that kid I was 25 years ago. That kid was lost. He needed guidance, and I have guidance now,” Ritchie added.
“What I did was horrible. But it’s a blessing, because William Toney’s life could best be served by me helping other guys,” he reiterated. “I’m never going to go home. I’m OK with that. But if I’m in here, I’m trying to help guys not reoffend, not come back to this system.”
Closure for some, an injustice to others
Toney’s family and friends who have spoken publicly said Ritchie’s execution is the final, necessary step in a years long journey for closure.
“It’s time. We’re all tired,” said Dee Dee, Toney’s widow. “It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It’s time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill’s life, and not his death.”
Joel Hand, a former prosecutor on Ritchie’s case, told the Capital Chronicle that he remains “firmly” supportive of Ritchie’s death sentence.
“Indiana has the death penalty for a reason, and murder of a law enforcement officer in the line of duty is clearly one of the qualifiers for capital punishment,” Hand said in a recent interview. He added that “there is absolutely nothing about this case that would have indicated in any way, shape, or form, that the death penalty was not appropriate for Benjamin Ritchie.”
Hand noted that during trial proceedings, Ritchie showed “no remorse,” was disrespectful to his own counsel, and “was very spiteful and hateful” toward Toney’s widow.
Among the other Indiana officials who have urged that state to move forward with the scheduled execution, Delaware County Prosecutor Eric Hoffman said in a recent letter that “there are absolutely no injustices to correct in Ritchie’s convictions and sentence.”
Hoffman was not involved in prosecuting the case but said he felt compelled to speak out. 
“Perhaps the only injustice is that it has taken this long to carry out the lawfully imposed sentence of death,” he wrote. “Quite the contrary. Perhaps the only injustice is that it has taken this long to carry out the lawfully imposed sentence of death.”
He emphasized the gravity of Ritchie’s actions and framed the crime as an attack not just on one officer, but on the rule of law itself. 
Hoffman described law enforcement as “peace keepers, the shield for the innocent and vulnerable, the guardians standing between us and violence and lawlessness.” 
Story continues below.
Ritchie letter
 
“They form the thin blue line that stands between criminals and their would-be victims,” he continued. “It is the police who stand on that line between law, order, and safety and that of chaos, anarchy, and violence.”
Police officers, he added, “have the absolute right to go home to their family at the end of their shift.” 
“Benjamin Ritchie infringed on Officer Toney’s rights in the most egregious way,” Hoffman wrote. “Ritchie seeks mercy. However, mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent.” 
But opponents of the death penalty argue that Ritchie’s execution would not reflect justice.
Anti-death penalty advocates note that Ritchie’s “widely publicized mental disabilities … have never been fully considered in court,” raising concerns about “disparities in the use of the death penalty.”
Leadership at Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, further emphasized that since Ritchie was convicted in 2002, 29 additional Indiana law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty, “yet not one of those cases has resulted in a death sentence.”
“Benjamin Ritchie can be held accountable and severely punished without executing him,” said Abraham Bonowitz, the groups’ executive director. “Governor Braun has until Monday night at midnight to change his mind. We urge him to please show mercy by commuting Ben Ritchie’s death sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.”
Statistics cited by Death Penalty Action further show that law enforcement officers are more likely to be killed in the line of duty in states that have the death penalty than in states that do not have it, “and even more so in states that actually carry out executions.”

Ritchie’s attorneys wanted to explore his FASD diagnosis before the Indiana Supreme Court, but the justices denied requests for a new hearing. The inmate’s lawyers are now seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court. As of Monday morning, a decision had not been issued.
A separate lawsuit filed by Ritchie’s lawyers last week sought to allow clergy to be present at the Tuesday execution. Court records indicate the case was resolved as of Friday, though the terms remain unclear. After suing the state, Joseph Corcoran was allowed to have a pastor in the execution chamber.
It’s also still unclear whether any media representatives will be invited to witness Ritchie’s execution.
A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the Capital Chronicle and four other news outlets to pause a state law and Department of Correction (DOC) policy barring independent media witnesses.
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
The Capital Chronicle and other news outlets have requested spots on Ritchie’s witness list but have so far been denied.
“We have to make sure that with execution, which you can’t take back, everything is done correctly. In this case, you can’t say that Ben’s had fair process,” said Mark Koselke, an attorney on Ritchie’s defense team. “His most important goal right now is to help as much as possible … to help better the prison system, and help people that are going to get out someday — and to do good on behalf of Toney’s name for what happened, as much as he can, with what’s given left in his life.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Some are questioning the wisdom of Oklahoma Republicans’ plans to cut taxes amid the ongoing push for budgetary reform in the nation’s Capitol that aims to shift the cost for some high-dollar federal programs onto states.
Some critics of the plan to cut Oklahoma’s income tax 0.25% said the state will likely need the revenue the existing tax generates if congressional Republicans move forward with plans to require states to bear some costs of programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as SNAP or food stamps. Experts also point to broader economic concerns that the Trump administration’s tariffs could increase the costs for goods and reduce consumer spending, resulting in less sales tax revenue.
But a top legislative Republican said he is not concerned about the budgetary uncertainty playing out in D.C. 
Republicans said that now is the right time to cut the state’s top income tax rate from 4.75% to 4.5%, which will allow Oklahomans to keep more of their money. They said will grow spending and increase Oklahoma’s competitiveness in luring new residents to the state.
Gov. Kevin Stitt said the state’s income tax used to be 7% and has been gradually reduced.
“And every time we’ve seen that, the economy continues to expand,” Stitt said. “We’ve seen revenue continue to grow.”
A family of four with an income of $50,000 would save about $137 a year, according to Senate staff.
The Oklahoma Policy Institute, a Tulsa-based think tank, said a 0.25% cut will cost state coffers about $338 million annually.
Lawmakers are also discussing reducing the number of income tax brackets to three from six. The organization estimates that it will cost an additional $87 million a year.
“It is not wise at all,” said Aanahita Ervin, the organization’s fiscal policy analyst, of making tax cuts this year. “The (federal) costs are going to impact every state.”
Oklahoma Democratic lawmakers are also sounding the alarm, though being in the minority they can do little on their own to stop a tax cut.
Under the most current plan, congressional Republicans are hoping to reduce Medicaid spending by about $625 billion, and require states for the first time to contribute to SNAP
In Oklahoma, nearly 1 in 4 residents are on Medicaid, and about 17% of people receive food stamps.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said state leaders don’t have enough certainty from Congress to cut taxes right now.
“We won’t know the federal budget until after session, so we are making decisions in a vacuum,” she said.
Even without tax cuts, Oklahoma would still struggle to cover any federal cost shifts, she said.
Kirt said the federal government has sent states billions in pandemic relief dollars. That has propped up budgets, not prudent planning, she said.
But Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who supports the cut, said he isn’t worried about the federal uncertainty.
“I don’t think it is going to impact this budget year,” Paxton said. “If anything happens, it will be down the road and give us time to plan for it.”
Republicans say the state has about $3.5 billion in savings.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said Oklahoma voters a few years ago approved Medicaid expansion and enshrined it in the state Constitution, so the legislators must pay for it even if the federal government does not, she said.
“There is a lot of uncertainty with what’s happening at the federal level,” she said.
Ervin, with the Policy Institute, said it will be difficult for Oklahoma lawmakers to raise taxes if revenue is needed in the future.
In 1992, voters passed State Question 640 that required a three-fourths vote in both chambers or a vote of the people to raise taxes, something which has only been done once in three decades.
Ervin said lawmakers’ first instinct would be to cut services and or rely on savings before raising taxes.
“I think they will exhaust all those options before they even come close to talking about raising taxes,” Ervin said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Judging by all the backpatting we witnessed last week, Oklahoma’s Republican legislative leaders want us to believe their latest budget deal will make our state a beacon of prosperity .
In reality, it feels a lot like the opposite.
It appears Oklahomans ended up with a budget agreement negotiated behind closed doors by a small group of influential lawmakers and lobbyists that got their hearts’ desires at our expense. And, it appears this is a budget that has been crafted in a vacuum by people completely oblivious to the giant pile of flaming dog doo that Congress appears poised to leave on our doorstep. (Maybe that fire is the light from the previously mentioned beacon.)
I couch this all with “appears” because 99.99% of us have no idea how Oklahoma’s budget was created.
Last year, Oklahomans for the first time were able to watch budget negotiations play out in real time during a series of public hearings. While those conversations at times were as dull as watching paint dry, they really helped the public — including the media — understand how the deal was reached. And, they helped curtail lobbyists’ influence.
Unfortunately, the House and Senate legislative leaders who championed that strategy termed out or lost reelection. They were replaced by new leaders who, disappointingly, decided to scrap that process and largely revert to conducting budget talks in meetings that aren’t publicly accessible.
So we don’t know why – after years of resistance – that this is the year lawmakers chose to bow to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s pressure to cut the state’s income tax. The expected impact of the 0.25% cut on state coffers varies greatly depending on who you ask.
The timing is a headscratcher because Congress is planning cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps, that could require states like ours to foot the difference. Not to mention that pesky inflation that while slowing has not disappeared.
That $3.5 billion that lawmakers are bragging about having in savings isn’t going to last long if the federal government decides to require our state to pay for federal programs that help low-income residents. Ours is the sixth poorest state after all.
I don’t understand why our Legislature doesn’t want to wait until the dust settles in D.C. before making tax cuts. After all, to raise taxes requires a supermajority legislative vote or a vote of the people. 
Maybe lawmakers are focused on political points for the moment. But cutting taxes now could leave future Legislatures in a precarious financial position. It wasn’t long ago that Oklahoma lawmakers cut taxes and then had to plug a $1 billion shortfall. During that time, in 2018, they had to cut services and even had to raise taxes on gas and diesel, cigarettes and gross production.
I’d rather any savings from Stitt’s tax cut be invested in fixing our pothole-ridden public roadways or boosting teacher salaries so we can get more qualified educators in our classrooms. 
Or perhaps we could invest it in growing other state agencies’ budgets. Most of those will remain flat next year, which would be great, except for the fact that everything is getting more expensive. That means they’re getting cut.
Lawmakers increased public school funding by $25 million, but allocated double that in new money to private schools, which serve only a small fraction of school children. In exchange for that $25 million, public schools will be required to add an instructional day to their school calendar, which will pretty much eliminate any financial benefit from that windfall. Private schools face no such requirement.
But even beyond that, this budget inexplicably contains over $750 million in special interest projects.
Instead of requiring the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University to fundraise to feed their ambitions, lawmakers think taxpayers should foot the $200 million bill to build OU’s new pediatric heart hospital and spend $250 million so OSU can improve its College of Veterinary Medicine.
Taxpayers are being asked to subsidize those projects at the same time our state’s CareerTech is slated to see its budget reduced by about 8.8%, or by over $17 million. 
CareerTech is an entity that provides career and technical training to over 520,000 Oklahomans each year, preparing them to work in many of our professions that don’t require a traditional college degree, but face critical shortages. Health care would be one of those.
Maybe we should fund that and our other core government services adequately before spending $312 million to buy a private prison in Lawton. That purchase sounds like a terrible investment for a state whose voters have signaled at the ballot box that they want to reduce our state’s incarceration rates. There wouldn’t be a need to buy more prisons if lawmakers are taking that missive seriously.
Most years these budget agreements sail through the Legislature, but there are plenty of new faces in the Capitol this year that have proven that they’re not afraid to challenge the status quo. 
No budget agreement should ever be a done deal without giving Oklahomans time to weigh in. 
Like all budgets, it will still need to clear the committee process, be voted on by both chambers and be acted upon by Stitt. Lawmakers have until 5 p.m. May 30 to pass one.
So here’s hoping that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle take the time to listen to their constituents and that they’re thinking critically about whether all the components of this budget along with the proposed tax cut best position our state for success in future years.

(Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.
The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
 Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
 Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

The post Wyoming lawmakers go after funding for state associations that sometimes oppose their bills appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Wyoming Legislature has shifted further to the right in recent years, the conservative concept of local control has lost sway in debates over several topics, including guns, education and taxes. 
Now, some state lawmakers want more say over local governments’ spending on dues to associations that advocate on their behalf. 
“Elimination of publicly funded associations prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to fund private entities that may prioritize their own interests over those of the public,” Rep. Marlene Brady, R-Green River, told the May 9 Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee in Lander. 
Endorsed by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus last summer, Brady is leading the charge on a proposal to prohibit cities, towns and counties from using public funds to cover elected officials’ membership in associations.
“We’ve also seen that they go and they use our dime, the taxpayer dime, to go and lobby against every one of the bills that the people put forward,” Brady told the committee. “That is unacceptable. We are tired of it.”
Organizations like the Wyoming County Commissioners Association and the Wyoming Association of Municipalities lobby in Cheyenne during the session on behalf of local officials and based on priorities agreed to by their memberships. 
Earlier this year, those associations — alongside firefighters, law enforcement, community colleges and special districts — cautioned lawmakers on passing certain property tax cuts whose cost local governments will shoulder.

Organizations like WCCA and WAM also provide education, training and networking opportunities. Those services, in particular, are an invaluable resource, according to the more than 20 local officials from across the state who testified at the May 9 meeting. That included mayors, commissioners, county attorneys, county treasurers, county clerks and district court clerks. 
Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock was among them. He recalled to the committee his first Wyoming Association of Municipalities conference more than a decade ago. 
“I got to tell you, it was amazing,” Murdock said. “I learned how to do open meetings. I learned how to navigate ethics rules, budget responsibilities … It is practical, nonpartisan and frankly, empowering.”
When Murdock sees “people trying to quiet the dissenting voice, when they try to quiet the local voice, it just irks the heck out of me,” he added. 
Despite overwhelming testimony against the prohibition, the committee decided by a straw poll to continue the topic at its August meeting in Casper. 
As part of that discussion, the committee will review a bill from 2021 to prohibit the use of tax revenue for lobbying, per a request from Rep. Ann Lucas, R-Cheyenne.
Associations
Government associations play important roles in the legislative process, advocates say.
“We see ourselves as providing a bridge between legislative intent and practical implementation,” Natalia Macker, Wyoming County Commissioners Association president and Teton County commissioner, told lawmakers. 
With four staff members, Macker said, the association focuses on areas of taxation, infrastructure, public safety, health and human services and land use.
“We offer input from counties that have a wide variety of perspectives and help gather that for you so that you can use it in your decision making,” she said. “We also help provide analysis to ensure we avoid unfunded mandates and unintended consequences. We receive requests from the [Legislative Service Office,] from legislative committees, from individual legislators and from state agencies. We also work together with federal agencies and our federal delegation.”
Asked how the organization is funded, Macker said it’s a combination of membership dues, private sector partners and several of its own revenue-generating streams. 
As for membership dues, Macker said it depends on the county. Smaller counties pay less, larger counties pay more. Teton County’s annual dues, Macker said, will be around $36,000 in the upcoming fiscal year. 
Without the association, Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, asked how smaller counties would fare. 
“Financially, it would put a terrible burden on us if we weren’t part of the association,” Weston County Commissioner Ed Wagner said, echoing several other officials from smaller communities who told lawmakers they either did not have the staff or funding to substitute the services associations provide to them.

Like the county association, the Wyoming Association of Municipalities uses a sliding scale when determining membership dues. 
“The City of Casper, which is probably one of the larger due payers, as you might imagine, pays roughly $55,000 a year,” Casper City Manager and WAM President Carter Napier told the committee. 
That cost amounts to roughly 0.028% of Casper’s 2025 budget of $193 million. The town of Shoshoni, meanwhile, pays a “few hundred a year,” Napier said.
“I don’t know how you get a more efficient expenditure of a taxpayer dollar to receive the services, that are premium services, for the same kind of same kind of money,” Napier said. 
Even as one of Wyoming’s largest cities, Casper Mayor Ray Pacheco told lawmakers his community also relies on WAM to track legislation, provide legal clarity and help interpret and implement new policy.
“Let me be clear, this is not just about small towns. This is about local control. I’m going to say that again, this is about local control,” Pacheco said. 
“This is about our ability to govern ourselves as guaranteed by the Wyoming Constitution. When we prohibit cities and towns from voluntarily joining associations like WAM, we weaken that self-governance. We isolate communities and we make it harder, not easier, for local governments to do their jobs.”
Opposition
The two hours’ worth of testimony from local officials did little to sway  Brady, the lawmaker leading the charge on the proposal. Instead, she accused them of having dishonest motivations. 
“I would venture to guess that everyone [who] testified this morning in support of the associations is being paid,” Brady said. 
Brady also clarified that she was not necessarily against the existence of associations, but opposed tax dollars funding them. Instead, local officials should pay for such services out of pocket. 
“The local elected officials, I feel, are given enough salary that I would hope they’d be able to get together and come to some kind of, just work together [for] what’s best for their communities,” Brady said. 
When Brady said 18 states have banned taxpayer dollars from funding associations, Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, followed up.

“My question to you is, where are you getting that information? Who’s providing it to you? Because it’s wrong,” Landen said, pointing to the National Conference of State Legislatures website that indicated otherwise. 
“States just don’t do this,” he said. 
Brady did not say where her information was from but told the committee she would provide a hard copy of her source.
Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, asked Brady in two different iterations whether the state ought to determine the budgets of local governments. She did not provide a direct answer. However, Rep. Gary Brown, R-Cheyenne, eventually weighed in, pointing to Article 4, Section 14 of the Wyoming Constitution. 
“The Legislature shall provide by law for examination of the accounts of state treasurer, supreme court clerks, district court clerks, and all county treasurers, and treasurers of such other public institutions as the legislature may prescribe,” it reads. 
“The Constitution of Wyoming does give the Legislature the oversight of all accounts in the state,” Brown said. “So yes, we need to be looking at those.”
Yin pushed back on the suggestion with a quip. 
“I’m excited to do more micromanagement,” Yin said. 
The committee’s next meeting is Aug. 14 in Casper.

A riotously amusing program in which trained actors perform plays written by elementary students got gouged by Trump’s funding cuts, but debuts new plays Thursday.
The post Despite funding cut, the show goes on for Laramie’s elementary school playwrights appeared first on WyoFile .","“The Moose,” a debut production from Wyoming’s newest playwriting sensation Axel, is a tale of conflict and loss.
Actors from Sheridan’s WYO Theater are rehearsing the performance ahead of a Thursday night curtain raising at the University of Wyoming’s Thrust Theater, which seats 245 people. It’s not yet public which of the troupe’s actors will take on the starring roles: that of the hapless Tim, and that of the moose, named Moose, who (spoiler alert) ousts him from his home.
Over three scenes, Tim tries to win his home back through force (a boxing match), trickery and pleading. 
During a break in production work on a recent Friday afternoon, a WyoFile reporter had the chance to ask Axel about the inspiration behind his play — the kind of darkly tinged tale where the good guy might not necessarily win.
“I wear a moose hat a lot,” the playwright said. “Like almost every day.”
Axel is 10, but almost 11. He’s a fifth grader at Rock River Elementary School, a small rural community around 40 miles north of Laramie.

He wrote “The Moose” through the Play/Write program, an arts education initiative of Laramie nonprofit theater company Relative Theatrics. (WyoFile editor Tennessee Watson is a former board member of Relative Theatrics.) Play/Write today operates in three Albany County elementary schools, where students learn the basic building blocks of writing plays and understanding theater. The curriculum builds toward its annual climax — Thursday’s showcase of 10 plays written by elementary school students and performed by theater groups of various age groups. 
Besides Axel’s play, UW acting students will also perform Wooly Story, written by Karter, who is one grade below Axel at Rock Creek Elementary. Wooly is a cowboy rapper, and a sheep. Karter’s play centers on the efforts of two best friends, Addie and Layla, to attend his concert and ultimately hypnotize Wooly into a dance party. 
(Play/Write asked WyoFile not to use the minor students’ last names, to protect their digital privacy.) 
Another play delves into the psyche of chess pieces — a king grows insecure about the fact that the queen is really the most powerful piece on the board, and seeks to undermine her reputation in the press. 
The play’s authors have not seen their work performed. They will get their first look at how the adults interpreted their characters and storylines Thursday morning, before the evening’s showcase, which is free and open to the public. 
At the 2024 showcase, actors from Relative Theatrics performed a play by a Spring Creek Elementary School fifth grader named Amelia about a group of inanimate objects who together ponder whether they’re alive.

“They got very creative with it,” Amelia tells Relative Theatrics founder Anne Mason after the show, in an interview posted to YouTube. “The jokes were very funny and a lot of people laughed,” Amelia said, “and I didn’t realize that as I was writing the play.” 
Though only some students’ plays get produced for the showcase, every student’s play is published and archived. This year, the program expanded for its second year in Rock River, where the students wrote and produced a play together that they will perform Thursday. The day WyoFile visited the Play/Write program at the Laramie Plains Civic Center, Play/Write founder Will Bowling was teaching Axel a computer program for capturing sounds and music to enhance that performance. 
Bowling is a theatre professional who moved to Laramie in 2021 and brought Play/Write to Wyoming with him. It’s modeled after a program he helped found in 2010, during a prior life in New Orleans. By the time Bowling decamped to Albany County, that program had spread into school districts all around that fabled city of writers and musicians. 
Bowling approached Mason and pitched the idea, explaining he saw a need for additional arts education in the local school system that didn’t cost school districts more funding. Relative Theatrics, he said, could serve as a “third-party arts education provider.” After a year of fundraising, the program launched in two elementary schools in 2023. Bowling hopes to expand into one or two more schools next year. Ultimately, he wants Play/Write to serve as a model for programs in other Wyoming counties.

Bowling has funded the program through a mix of federal, state and private funding streams. Like so much of the public arts in America, he’s seen a swathe of funding cut by President Donald Trump’s administration. That includes a $10,000 grant that he was awarded for this year, but which he said the federal government never actually sent to Relative Theatrics. The federal money represents around 15% of Play/Write’s budget. The cut came, Bowling said, to the Challenge America program, which the National Endowment for the Arts ended under the Trump administration. 
The program existed to support “historically underserved communities that have limited access to the arts relative to geography, ethnicity, economics, and/or disability,” according to a previous federal description of the program found online. 
“For Wyoming, that includes rural,” said Bowling, who was elected to the Laramie city council in 2024. “But those words are now synonymous with diversity, equity and inclusion,” he said — terms that the Trump administration has done its best to wipe out of federal funding programs. 
Bowling worries for other arts programs that don’t have cute kids writing funny plays to tout when they go knocking at the doors of donors. But Play/Write will continue to expand, he said. 
“Arts and culture and the cultural economy are like the fundamental underpinnings of a good communally and civically engaged society,” Bowling said. “And no matter if your kid grows up to be an engineer or to be a performing artist, the arts provide an entry point into educational rigor and achievement that is really unique.”
Take Axel and “The Moose.”
When Axel first began penning his script, the words flowed unhindered, he told WyoFile. “The start of the play was really easy,” Axel said. “I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted the boxing fight.”
But at a peer-to-peer writing session, Axel got mixed up over the development of a girl moose character, named Mooseabelle. He was stumped by a question from his peer about the connection between Moose and Mooseabelle. Were they siblings? Was it a romance?
Axel, who wishes he had a sister, settled on siblings. The writing went on, though not without its fits and starts. 
At one point, “I deleted two entire pages, because it wasn’t any good,” Axel said.
Welcome to the writing life, Axel. We at WyoFile extend our deepest sympathies.

The Michigan Board of State Canvassers approved summary language for a second proof-of-citizenship ballot initiative, setting the state’s voters up to weigh in not only on whether they want such a requirement in the state Constitution but also on how strict they want those requirements to be.
Americans for Citizen Voting won unanimous support from the board Friday for a 99-word summary of its new ballot initiative, and can soon begin collecting the nearly 450,000 signatures from registered voters that are required to get the question on the 2026 ballot
The proof-of-citizenship proposal from ACV, a product of the Virginia-based libertarian Liberty Initiative Fund, follows another one from the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights, which won unanimous board approval last month for the summary of its proposal.
The two initiatives are similar: Both would require new voters — and possibly currently registered voters — to prove their U.S. citizenship, , and both would eliminate the option for voters who lack a photo ID to sign an affidavit attesting to their identity.
Still, board members focused mainly on the differences between the proposals.
The ACV proposal, for instance, could set Michigan up to maintain two separate voter lists, as Arizona does — one for those who have proven their citizenship and can vote in all elections, and one for those who haven’t and who could only vote only in federal races. The proposal also introduces penalties for registrants and election officials who violate its provisions.
Both Republican and Democratic members of the bipartisan board expressed concerns about the intent of the second initiative. Richard Houskamp, a Republican and the chair of the board, said he feared the proposed penalties would allow for “weaponizing” against other voters. Board Vice Chair Mary Ellen Gurewitz, a Democrat, said she believed the proposal would have “a seriously injurious effect on the voters of Michigan.”
Voters “ought to understand that your proposal is dramatically different from the one that we previously considered,” Gurewitz said to representatives of Americans for Citizen Voting.
But the board’s obligation at Friday’s hearing was to finalize the summary language that appears on petitions. State law requires the summary to be not more than 100 words, accurate in its description of the proposal, unbiased, and written “using words that have a common everyday meaning to the general public.” Petitioners are allowed to gather signatures without getting their language approved by the board, but most opt to come before the canvassers to ensure their effort isn’t later thrown out for not meeting those requirements.
Getting to accurate and unbiased language took several hours. Board members debated among themselves and with representatives from both ACV and CPVR on what should be included.
“I think what’s been done to the summary is a fair way to put it in front of Michigan voters,” Houskamp said of the proposal summary.
While the summary was approved, the form it will appear on was not: After a few typos were discovered in the proposed amendment to the constitution, ACV withdrew its request for approval of the form and said it will bring it back for approval in June.
The twin ballot proposals in Michigan are part of a conservative push across the country to require voters to prove their citizenship before registering to vote or casting a ballot. Michigan Republicans have focused on the effort since at least the fall, when a University of Michigan student from China was found to have cast a ballot in the November election despite not being a citizen. A further review from the state found 15 other noncitizens who may have cast a ballot in the general election.
House Republicans first introduced a proposal to amend the constitution earlier this year that would require voters to show documentary proof of citizenship, but it so far has failed to gain enough support to move to the Senate. The Citizens to Protect Voters’ Rights initiative is nearly identical to that proposal.
To get on the ballot in 2026, each petition initiative would need to get nearly 450,000 signatures from registered voters. If both make it, and both win approval from a majority of voters, the one with more yes votes would be the one that amends the Michigan Constitution.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The final 10-day countdown has begun for the Nebraska Legislature’s 2025 session, with little time or funding to enact a slew of designated priorities.
Every year, all 49 state senators get to designate one bill as a “priority” for the year. Committee chairs get an additional two priority bills, and the speaker of the Legislature gets 25 extra priorities, usually reserved for non-controversial measures. 
This year, there are 106 priority bills or constitutional amendments. All but 10 priority proposals have been reported out of various legislative committees or are in a separate package.
The system is meant to help streamline the limited time in 90-day sessions in odd years and 60-day sessions in even years. Of lawmaker priorities, 39 have passed and 21 are one round of voting away from passage — including a bill related to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits that will have a veto override vote Monday afternoon.


Status of 2025 lawmaker priority proposals, as of May 15

Still in committee: 11 proposals (one identical to a measure on the final stage of debate).
First stage of debate: 19 proposals (of those, one failed, one is in a package).
Second stage of debate: 17 proposals (of those, two failed, one is in a package).
Final stage of debate: 20 proposals (of those, one failed).
Awaiting the governor’s signature: 21 proposals.
Vetoed: 1 proposal (veto override motion filed).
Signed into law: 17 proposals.



In Nebraska, with just one legislative chamber, bills move through three rounds of debate. Lumping together priority bills and all other measures passed this year, a total of 136 bills had passed the Legislature and another 34 more were one step away from passage heading into the final 10 days. These totals would be higher if they separated out the number of bills that have been packaged together.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who sets the daily agenda, said it was “very unusual” for at least half of priority bills to be stuck in committee when lawmakers moved March 31 to all-day debate.
However, he said, lawmakers had an opportunity to work through many “good government” bills as they advanced from committee, which he said helped a large freshman class learn the ropes.
“It isn’t just me sitting in my office deciding what’s going to be scheduled, what isn’t going to be scheduled,” Arch said. “The input that I seek from the sponsor and those in opposition kind of tells me, especially the sponsor, whether or not they feel that bill is ready to move.”
Uniting for the ‘common good’
Arch said relationship building among lawmakers has been crucial as senators continue making progress in what he says is “learning how to debate difficult subjects” since he took the reins in the 2023 session — an 88-day session marked by rampant filibusters and partisan rancor. 
That progress is important, he said, because debate shapes final policy decisions.
“We still have strong passion. We still have hurt feelings. We still have strong opinions on what is the right policy,” Arch said. “But how we have handled ourselves, and how we have improved in that area, I think, has been encouraging to me, and I think encouraging to the body.”

State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, joined on day 59 of the 2023 session, calling it a “low bar.” Compared to then, she said, 2025 has been “OK.”
Bosn said all senators “wholeheartedly” want what they think is best for Nebraska, and while there are disagreements, 2025 has featured respect, decorum and compromises.
“I think we’ve had hiccups and then we have moments where we come together and work towards what we can all say is a common good on a lot of things,” Bosn said.
‘I have the clock’
However, some progressive colleagues to Bosn and Arch disagreed that 2025 has improved from 2023, such as State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who defined the 2025 session as working against Nebraskans and “stripping away” recent investments or deals.
“In a lot of ways, I think it’s going to cause a lot of harm, especially when you look at us becoming a ‘felony factory,’” McKinney said, quoting a phrase from State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha as the Legislature creates or expands some felony crimes.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who led the 2023 logjam, has again pledged to weaponize the limited time on those she says have brushed off Nebraskans, such as watering down voter-approved paid sick leave and minimum wage laws. In 2023, she slowed the process to a crawl by talking for days on end, including on noncontroversial bills.
“You have the votes, but I have the clock,” Cavanaugh said last week, aimed at Republicans.
Lawmaker priorities
Part of the balancing act in the final 10 days of 2025 involves the state budget for the next two years. With the expected passage of Legislative Bill 513, to give all judges 1.5% raises each of the next two years, lawmakers have $1.1 million to possibly spend on other priorities.
The governor has until midnight on Wednesday to offer any line-item vetoes to the state budget, which could increase the amount of funds lawmakers have access to.

As the session draws to a close by June 9, the window for some measures to move forward is tight and will largely depend on how Arch designs the remaining schedule. Typically, the final day is reserved for possible veto overrides, or lawmakers can adjourn early if none are needed. Bills would need to pass by June 2, the 89th day, to leave time for a veto override if needed.
Some lawmakers’ priority bills will also be filibustered, taking up hours that could jam up the remaining days and place some bills out of reach.
Priority bills left behind
All bills not killed or passed this year can continue in 2026, alongside a new slate of legislation. 
Arch said he hasn’t yet decided what could happen with 2025 priority bills that don’t reach a conclusion this year, as he waits to see how many, if any, are left behind and could find a way back into focus next year.
Among notable priority proposals that are left in committee, at least for now, include:

LB 156, to allow lawsuits against schools in cases of sexual assaults of children, a narrowed version of a bill vetoed in 2024, from State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln.
LB 298, to address and button-up the Legislature’s oversight of child welfare and corrections, from Arch.
LB 538, to require K-12 schools and colleges to adopt a policy and provide training to crack down on antisemitism, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering.
LB 634, to periodically review legislatively created boards, commissions, spending and more to see what can be repealed every 5 years, from Hansen.
Legislative Resolution 12CA, a constitutional amendment to limit annual property tax growth, from State Sens. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and Bob Andersen of Sarpy County.




Major proposals that could be fought or delayed in final days of 2025 session
Proposals expected to be filibustered, based on filed motions or lawmaker threats, include:

Restricting lawsuits and capping damages for certain civil cases, including when a commercial vehicle injures or kills a Nebraskan (LB 79, a Judiciary Committee package led by State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse).
Increasing property tax relief by raising revenue through sales taxes and taxes on cigarettes and vapes (LB 170, from State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth).
Endorsing religious “release time” in schools and increasing a payroll tax on teachers to cover long-term substitutes and teacher retention or recruitment (LB 306, an Education Committee package led by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the committee chair).
Banning most tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products (LB 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and prioritized by State Sen. Jared Storm of David City).
Concealing certain workplace injury reports and modifying the current standard of paying judgments or settlements in certain workers’ compensation cases (LB 455, from Hallstrom).
Lowering the minimum age for which juveniles could be detained from 13 to 11 and increasing speeding fines as part of a broad “public safety” package (LB 530, a Judiciary Committee package led by Kauth and prioritized by Bosn).
Mandating E-Verify for certain workers and requiring recipients of unemployment benefits to respond to job offers and show up to job interviews (LB 532, a Business and Labor Committee package led by Kauth, the committee chair).
Requiring the burial or cremation of aborted fetal remains (LB 632, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair and prioritized by Dan Lonowski of Hastings).
Passing a medical cannabis regulatory system (LB 677, from Hansen and prioritized by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue as chair of the General Affairs Committee).

Lawmakers are also weighing what to do with a priority bill from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, LB 258, to slow down annual voter-approved increases to the state minimum wage. The measure failed last week when one supporter missed the final vote to pass the bill. One possible path forward that some senators have discussed could be attaching it to LB 415, to weaken a minimum paid sick leave system for all state employees beginning Oct. 1.

“This stuff is astonishingly dirty,” said Andy Stahl, the executive director of the organization. “Why the hell are we using such a dirty retardant?”

The chemicals found in some retardants can also be fatal to aquatic life and high concentrations of the metals can be toxic to humans, too. The lawsuit focuses on the effect on wildlife, alleging the federal agencies are violating the Endangered Species Act.
“At the risk of doing the regulatory agencies job for them, Plaintiff points out the obvious – toxic metals in aerial retardant are bad for many Threatened and Endangered species,” the lawsuit reads.
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are also defendants in the lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs are seek acknowledgement and disclosure of the toxic metals being used, as well as biological opinions from other agencies assessing the impact of the fire retardant on threatened and endangered animals.
The USC study, which is referenced in the lawsuit, was published in 2024 after researchers bought fire retardant and put it in a mass spectrophotometer to determine the chemical make-up of the retardant.
“Based on information and belief, the Forest Service has known about the presence of some, or all, of these metals in aerial fire retardant since well before the publication of the USC study,” the lawsuit reads.
The study estimated that between 2009 and 2021, about 840,000 pounds of toxic metals were added into the environment due to fire retardant drops in the United States.
Companies only had to disclose part of their retardant formula, according to the study, necessitating the mass spectrometry test. Previous concerns around retardants mostly centered on it containing ammonium polyphosphates, which can kill wildlife.
“They’re the ones who have really blown open this issue that retardant, the Phos-Chek retardant, contains astonishingly high levels of heavy metals like cadmium,” Stahl said. “We’ve suspected that for years.”

 ‘Most expensive, least effective’

The organization filed the suit in Missoula in part due to its long association with wildland firefighting.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a Technology and Development Center in Missoula, which includes a lab where fire retardants are tested and certified. Missoula has been at the center of aerial firefighting since the 1940s.
“Missoula tends to be a focal point with fire retardant,” said Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service fire research scientist with decades of fire experience.
He also worked at the Missoula Technology and Development Center and doesn’t think fire retardant’s work.
“It’s just about the most expensive, least effective mechanism of fire suppression,” Cohen said.
Drops can be impacted by winds, which can also ground aircraft in the first place. Embers can also move over retardant lines and in a famous example, jumped over a six-lane interstate near Santa Rosa during a 2017 fire.
Direct attack on a fire, or when firefighters’ objective is to contain the blaze as quickly as possible, is also a combination of people, machines and tools. Rarely, if ever, is only one method used to work a wildfire.

Cohen said multiple studies into whether retardant drops have any impact on the perimeter of fires have shown inconclusive results as to whether or not they work.
The assumption that retardant drops are effective is a dangerous notion, especially in legal arguments, Cohen said. In a previous lawsuit filed by the ethics group, a Missoula judge ruled that fire retardant does pollute water, but allowed agencies to continue the practice.
“The judge admitted that that was happening and essentially decided against withholding the use of the retardant based on the statement, something on the order of it is conceivable that greater harm to the environment, people and their property would occur without using fire retardant and that assumes that fire retardant is effective” Cohen said. “And to me, that’s very troubling.”
For Stahl, the drops are often about optics and he went on to say the vast majority of aerial retardant drops are ineffective. They are also only used on about 5% of fires, he added.
“Some of the Missoula Fire Science researchers have said to me, quietly, we would accomplish the same damn thing if we just put red food coloring into water and dumped it out of airplanes,” Stahl said. “It would look good on CNN. It wouldn’t be bad for the environment, and it would be just as effective in fire suppression.”
 ‘The cowboy coming over the ridge’

Fighting fires is expected to get more expensive across the country as the climate turns drier and hotter.
Forestry practices in the United States have also focused on suppression, necessitating the armies of firefighters and equipment fire agencies utilize each year. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the five-year average for suppression efforts in the U.S. is about $3 billion annually.
Prescribed fires, or fires set with the purpose of clearing out fuels or other land management goals, are sometimes used as a tool by fire agencies.
Decades of suppression have left many forests overgrown and full of dead wood, generally regarded in the firefighting world as “fuel” that can make fires more intense.
Prescribed burns seek to take some of that intensity out of wildfires by removing fuels ahead of time.
But there’s a problem there too, Cohen said — the scale of prescribed burns is not nearly enough.
“Prescribed burning is pointless the way we’re doing it now,” Cohen said.

Stahl brought up the example of recent wildfires in Minnesota. Prior to European colonization, the area was an oak savannah that did not have dense forest.
“We’ve committed all the great plains to croplands and have suppressed fire, we now have forests and these in Minnesota and similar northern tier states that used to be savanna, oak grasslands, and those forests when the humidity is low and the wind is high, which, by the way, means the airplanes that dump either water or retardant can’t fly. We get these fires, and they got lots to burn, a lot of biomass to burn.”
To address the issue, Cohen said the focus should be on building and planning. He views community wildfire risk as a structure ignition problem – the way we build makes structures too easily burned. He said if more fire resistant buildings are constructed with fire resistance in mind, fire crews can have a better plan to fight fires and fewer structures will be lost.
No community can fully be fireproofed, Cohen said, but that doesn’t mean it hurts to try. The more buildings that are protected, the less limited fire resources are stretched.
“We can reduce the number of ignitions that do occur and can be matched by our fire protection,” Cohen said.
Communities across the country are updating their fire readiness and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy has made a point of introducing legislation on the topic, including some for aerial response to fires.
The problem for some, though, is whether aerial bombardment is the most effective strategy for fighting wildfires. And whether the cost, both financially and on the environment, is worth it.
“We do it because it looks good on CNN. It’s the cowboy coming over the ridge,” Stahl said. “Everybody’s real excited. And they see the retardant bomber arrive and the red stuff come out of the plane. They think, ‘Oh, my God, we’re saved.’ Yeah, not so much.”

(Getty Images)Uncertainty over the continuation of federal fair housing grants under Trump administration cuts is keeping a West Tennessee legal aid nonprofit from helping as many clients as they typically would.
West Tennessee Legal Services provides free civil legal aid to limited-income clients in counties west of the Tennessee River, helping people secure or retain housing and meet other family safety needs.
The organization gets more than half of its housing services budget from an annual Fair Housing Initiatives Program grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination. The Fair Housing Act bars discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability.
The funding helps pay for education, outreach, legal casework and investigations, Director of Special Projects Vanessa Bullock said.
Bullock served as the nonprofit’s Fair Housing Project director and was involved in these grants for many years. She said most of the housing work they do — about 50-65% — benefits people with disabilities. The organization serves around 200 West Tennessee housing clients each year and sub-grants funding to Legal Aid offices in Middle and East Tennessee for similar programs.
But on Feb. 27, West Tennessee Legal Services received a letter informing them that the remainder of their $425,000 grant for the year was terminated immediately. The grant was one of 78 fair housing grants scrapped by HUD under the cost-cutting mission of President Donald Trump’s newly named Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
The termination came with no explanation.
West Tennessee Legal Services is used to navigating presidential transitions — every four to eight years, they go through grant re-negotiation when administrations’ priorities change. This time, there was no opportunity to have those conversations, Bullock said.
“There’s been speculation about why certain grants were cut and certain ones weren’t … Did we use too many of their target words in our application when other people didn’t? We honestly don’t know,” Bullock said. “In general, it’s just further fallout from cutting things without really understanding what they’re doing, without clear reason why.”
Four fair housing organizations filed a class action lawsuit in March contesting the sudden clawback. After a judge issued a temporary restraining order, HUD reinstated funding for West Tennessee Legal Services — which was not involved in the lawsuit — and others. The judge has since dissolved the order, noting that the lawsuit should be filed in the Court of Federal Claims.
“This decision should not be read as an endorsement of the brusque and seemingly insensitive way in which the terminations were announced,” Massachusetts District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns wrote in his decision.
The housing organizations are appealing the dissolution of the restraining order, and the lower court case is stayed in the meantime, court records show. HUD has not sent out fresh termination letters as of May 16.
West Tennessee Legal Services is treating the grant as reinstated, for now, but the future remains murky. The first year of the 3-year grant ends on July 31. It’s not clear if HUD intends to renegotiate the grants for years two and three, leaving a total $850,000 in question.
HUD could not be immediately reached for comment.
The organization is stuck in limbo, preparing for the worst and hoping for the best, Bullock said. That means taking on fewer cases than they normally would. If the grant funding doesn’t come through after July 31, they will have to reallocate cases to other funding sources.
The uncertainty, she said, is causing chaos. 
“We could have helped a lot of people with the time we spent trying to figure out the fallout from this,” Bullock said.
Ripple effects go beyond fair housing
West Tennessee Legal Services’ most typical housing cases involve people of all ages with disabilities. This could mean helping people know their rights and ask for things they are entitled to, like landlord approval for their service animal, or a release from their second-floor apartment lease if a mobility impairment forces them to seek more accessible housing, Bullock said.
Other disabilities are not as easily seen. The nonprofit helps people who are in recovery from addiction — considered a disability under the Fair Housing Act — find housing despite rental histories tarnished by their addiction and past behavior. They also help survivors of domestic violence either terminate leases to seek new housing or get other reasonable accommodations like additional locks. 
Current clients will be taken care of, Bullock said. They may not even be aware that future funding is at risk. But moving those cases to other eligible funding sources has ripple effects.
“It’s not necessarily going to affect just housing funds. It’s going to affect our whole organization, to some extent, because we’re going to be taking funds that our family law unit might have been using to do family law work to do some housing work,” Bullock explained. 










The loss of (funding) for our agencies, plus the loss of the Tennessee Human Rights Commission happening at the same time is going to lead to people falling into the cracks,


– Vanessa Bullock, West Tennessee Legal Services


The biggest impact will be for future clients that they will have to turn away, she said.
Tennessee’s recent law disbanding the Tennessee Human Rights Commission and moving its functions into the Attorney General’s Office compounds the confusion, Bullock added.
By law, the Attorney General’s Office has until June 30 to reassign the now-defunct commission’s caseload. 
“The loss of (funding) for our agencies, plus the loss of the Tennessee Human Rights Commission happening at the same time is going to lead to people falling into the cracks,” Bullock said.
Tennessee House passes measure to dissolve state human rights commission

Another consequence of the potential funding loss could be felt by congressional offices and HUD itself, West Tennessee Legal Services Executive Director Ashley Holliday said. 
The nonprofit’s screening process helps educate people about their rights, what the Fair Housing Act protects, and what proof is needed for a successful case, Bullock said. If West Tennessee Legal Services has less resources to take calls and provide education to tenants and landlords alike, those calls are likely to end up going to congressional representatives and HUD instead.
“Frankly, we’re constituent services,” Holliday said. “When congressmen get calls from constituents saying, ‘I can’t get my Social Security case handled, I need help,’ we’re one of the agencies that they send their constituents to … This obviously affects the services that we can provide.”

A 2023 Arkansas law requires third graders who fail to meet literacy standards to be held back beginning with the 2025-26 school year, but the rules haven't been written yet. (Getty Images)Arkansas students entering the third grade at public schools and open enrollment charter schools this fall will be the first cohort to be retained if they don’t meet literacy expectations, a policy established by the 2023 LEARNS Act.
“By the beginning of the 2025-2026 school year, if a public school student has not met the third-grade reading standard, as defined by the state board, or the student does not have a good-cause exemption, as provided under this subsection, the student shall not be promoted to fourth grade,” the law states.
This new requirement could have extreme implications, considering a 2024 assessment showed that only about 36% of the state’s third graders could read proficiently.



Would the state of Arkansas really require all but 36% of the state’s public school third graders to be held back? It’s currently unclear.



State education officials haven’t yet set the new literacy standard by which third-grade reading will be measured for the 2025-2026 academic year.
Kimberly Mundell, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Education, didn’t answer specific questions about how the policy would play out.



“The law affects this school year’s second graders, who will be third graders next year,” Mundell said. “More information and details will be provided in the future.”



The LEARNS Act — a 2023 law that overhauled K-12 education with increased teacher pay, a controversial school voucher system and new volunteer requirements for public school students — tasked the State Board of Education with establishing the literacy standard for third graders.
Alisha Price, associate legal counsel for the state education department, said the nine-member board hasn’t yet crafted rules related to the literacy requirements, but it will be discussed this year.



“These rules have not started the drafting process but will soon,” Price said. “It usually takes a few months to go on a board agenda for approval, then public comment, but I do not yet have an estimate on that date.”



As with other requirements set by the Arkansas LEARNS Act, mandatory retention for third graders who fail to meet reading standards applies only in public schools. Private school and homeschool students are exempt.
Annual comprehensive testing typically occurs in April and May, near the end of the academic year. The current round of testing is expected to end Friday.
While the standard for next year isn’t set, data from an existing assessment — the Arkansas Teaching and Learning Assessment System (ATLAS) — showed that most third graders had not achieved proficiency, and had only a basic literacy understanding in 2024.
ATLAS replaced the ACT Aspire assessment that was used from third to 10th grade from 2016 through 2023. Last year was the first time school districts used ATLAS. State education officials have said the assessment created a new baseline that should not be compared to previous methods.
Of 250 public school districts included in state ATLAS data, a dozen reported that at least half of its third graders tested at the lowest level for reading, meaning students showed limited skills. Low reading scores also typically correlated to low English language arts (ELA) scores, another component of literacy testing within ATLAS.
Among the lower performers was Blytheville School District in Mississippi County, where 70% of its 109 students showed a limited understanding of reading and another 26% showed a basic understanding. According to last year’s state ATLAS data, only about five Blytheville third graders could read proficiently. The same data was reported for the school’s English language arts scores.
Last week, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said he intended to recommend to members of the State Board of Education that Blytheville School District should receive the highest level of state support due to declining enrollment and administrative challenges, the Arkansas Advocate reported.
Little Rock School District, which had the highest number of third graders in the state in 2024  — more than 1,500 — reported one in three children had only limited reading skills last year. The district’s English language arts scores matched within a few percentage points of its reading results. How those figures will compare to new literacy standards remains to be seen.
States have authority over day-to-day operations and curriculum standards in schools, making apples-to-apples comparisons among states tricky. Though that process leads to varying standards nationwide, the National Assessment of Educational Progress — known as “the nation’s report card” — tracks average reading scores and how they change over time. These national reports focus on fourth grade reading attainment, rather than third.
The congressionally mandated program within the U.S. Department of Education reported that no states saw improvements in reading scores among fourth graders from 2022 to 2019, and Arkansas students’ average scores decreased by three points. The state’s decrease was on par with the national trend among all public school fourth graders.
While the literacy standard the State Board of Education has been tasked to establish will apply to most third graders in public schools, there are some exceptions.
The education board has already adopted rules outlined in the LEARNS Act to set good-cause exemptions for promotion to the fourth grade, such as limited English proficiency students and those with individualized education programs or 504 plans. Other exemptions include students who were previously held back, kids on an intensive literacy intervention program, or those who have received a special education referral.
According to the Pew Research Center, roughly 16% of Arkansas public school students, K-12, have a learning disability. Dyslexia is among the most common learning disabilities, and state law requires school districts to screen each student in kindergarten through third grade for dyslexia, then provide appropriate resources for their academic success.
The State Board of Education further describes the third grade retention policy in the Right to Read Act, which outlines what public school districts or open enrollment charter schools should provide for students who don’t meet the reading standard or are promoted with good-cause exemptions.
The literacy improvement plan extends beyond the classroom and into students’ homes.
According to the rules, schools must provide 90 minutes of evidence-based literacy instruction each school day, assign the students to a high-performing teacher and send legal guardians a “read-at-home” plan.
Students will also be given priority to receive a literacy tutoring grant, and have the option to participate in additional programming.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — For the second time in a month, a long-sought project to bridge a gap between recreation trails from Omaha and Lincoln has seen a setback.
On Thursday, state lawmakers gave final approval to a two-year state budget that includes several budget cuts and claws back millions in previous funding to help close a multi-million budget shortfall.

Among the previously allocated funds taken back was $3.35 million from a trail development fund, which was part of an $8.3 million earmark the Nebraska Legislature made to build an 8-mile-long trail across rural Cass County.
That trail would fill the gap between the Mo-Pac Trail, which ends in Wabash, and the trail across the Lied Bridge, which ends just south of the Platte River.
The cutback comes a couple of weeks after the Cass County Board declined to approve a route for the trail — effectively rescinding a route approval made in November — that left the future of the recreation trail project to connect eastern Nebraska trails in limbo.
Julie Harris, the executive director of Bike-Walk Nebraska, a major advocate for the Cass County link, said the loss of the $3.35 million was “a hit” but not a fatal one for the project.
“We were disappointed to see that happen, because we know the value that this project will bring economically,” Harris said. “But we respect the work state senators have to do. We know it’s a very tough job.”
Some state support remains
Another trail advocate, Gerry Oligmueller, an avid bicyclist who had served as state budget director for many years before retiring, said the fact that $5 million remains allocated for the Cass County link is “continued affirmation” of state support for the trail.
Harris said that it’s possible that private donations could make up the lost $3.35 million, but advocates first need to know the route of the trail and its anticipated cost.
Bridging the gap between the Omaha and Lincoln trails has been in the works for at least two decades but has been slowed by the inability to find a route that is acceptable to local landowners and the county board.
Unlike most hike-bike rails, the Cass County link doesn’t utilize abandoned railroad right of way, thus a pathway requiring some land in county road ditches is being proposed. That makes the project more expensive, due to the need to install culverts and rock walls to prevent erosion, and more controversial, because it crosses some rural driveways.
Cass County has a say
  On the steps of the Cass County Courthouse, a debate broke out after the county board failed to give final approval to a route for a proposed hike-bike trail across the eastern Nebraska county. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
While Cass County is not contributing funds toward construction of the trail, it has the final say on the route because some of it uses county right of way.
The Cass County Board, at its May 6 meeting, appointed a two-member committee to work with the trail developer, the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District, in the hopes of finding an acceptable route.
At the meeting, a motion to approve the route recommended by a trail consultant and approved by the county board in November died for the lack of a “second” from another commissioner.
No other route was proposed or came up for a vote, thus leaving the route decision in limbo.
Some newly elected members of the Cass County Board have questioned the previous route chosen in November, saying it bypasses a nearby town, Murdock, and wouldn’t bring the $2.5 million in economic benefits projected.
The route chosen, Route D, would cost an estimated $10-15 million to complete, but the new commissioners suggested that another look be taken at a route that would follow a state highway and go through Murdock, which would make the trail more expensive, $24 million.
An official with the Lower Platte South NRD said that Route D was preferred by the consultant and the NRD because it was among the least expensive routes and was the least disruptive, crossing only three driveways.
No timetable was set for the subcommittee and NRD to come up with a new recommended route.

As a share of the population, Idaho has one of the highest number of veterans in the United States. Those veterans bring something Idaho desperately needs at all levels of government: firsthand experience putting mission above ego, country above faction and teamwork above personal gain. 
They understand sacrifice, discipline and the importance of making hard choices for the greater good. Imagine what a group of veterans — running as independents, free from the grip of party machines — could do for the people of Idaho, whether that is as a legislator, city council member, county commissioner or highway district commissioner.
These candidates would not be beholden to rigid platforms or state or national agendas. Instead, they would focus on local issues: improving access to affordable housing, strengthening education at the local level, supporting the transportation (including walking and biking) needs of local communities, protecting farms and water from urban encroachment and fostering economic opportunity for all Idahoans. 
Their independence would allow them to work across party lines and rebuild the trust and civility so often missing from our various seats of government, including the Statehouse.
We need veterans not just as symbols of service, but as active leaders helping reshape Idaho’s political landscape. We call on veterans across the state to consider stepping up — not as Republicans or Democrats, but as principled independents ready to serve again, this time in the helm of government at all levels.
Idaho’s future deserves leaders who understand that loyalty belongs to the people, not the party. Let’s help make that future a reality.

Jared Polis and state energy and transportation officials speak on Feb. 26, 2024. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)About $40 million a year in state funding from new transportation fees could be the key to getting a short passenger rail line from Denver to Fort Collins up and running in the next four years, Colorado officials said last week.
The project, spearheaded by Gov. Jared Polis and some of his top advisers, envisions a “joint service” between the Front Range Passenger Rail District, which eventually plans to serve cities as far south as Pueblo, and the Denver-area Regional Transportation District, which has struggled to complete a commuter line from Denver to Boulder that voters first approved more than 20 years ago.
“What we have in Colorado is a population who very much supports transit and rail, and would like to see an expansion of transit and rail, but they really need to see to believe,” Lisa Kaufmann, a senior strategic adviser to Polis, told members of the state’s Transportation Commission last week. “I think that we have a history of overpromising and not delivering rail projects in Colorado that looms large in all these conversations.”

The service would initially run three times a day between Denver and Fort Collins, with potential stops in Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder, Longmont and Loveland. The total price tag, including operating costs and debt payments for projected capital expenditures, is estimated at $83 million a year beginning in 2029, and about half that total would be covered by dedicated revenue from the state’s new fees on rental cars and oil and gas production. RTD sales tax revenue could cover the other half, state officials said.
An intergovernmental agreement between RTD, FRPR and the Colorado Department of Transportation is being drafted and will be presented to each agency’s governing board this summer, Kaufmann said. A joint committee will then start formal negotiations with BNSF, the railroad that owns the track the service will use, over an access agreement.
The railroad giant’s price tag for the use of their tracks was a crucial factor that derailed RTD’s plans for its commuter rail line to Boulder, which voters approved as part of the FasTracks plan in 2004. Agency officials had estimated that a lease would cost $66 million, but BNSF — one half of a duopoly, with Union Pacific, that owns virtually all U.S. railroads west of the Mississippi — quoted an upfront cost of $535 million in 2011, setting the project’s timeline back by decades.
Capital costs for any passenger rail service in BNSF’s rail corridor account for station infrastructure and safety mechanisms, including a so-called positive train control system, that are not required for the freight traffic that currently uses the Denver-to-Fort Collins segment. The state’s initial financial estimates, prepared by engineering consultancy HNTB, include $198 million in expenditures on signaling and communications upgrades, $124 million for vehicles and $92 million for station infrastructure.
“They want to work with us to make this possible, but of course, they are a business that they are running, and they want to do it in a way that’s mutually beneficial,” Kaufmann told commissioners about BNSF.
“In our private conversations with them, they believe that there is more cost savings to be had, once we get into real negotiations with them, than even what we’ve priced out through our study,” she added.
Mountain rail
State officials hope the launch of the northern Front Range route will follow on the heels of a separate “mountain rail” service planned to begin daily round trips from Denver to Granby by the end of 2026. They announced earlier this month that they had negotiated an access agreement with Union Pacific in exchange for the railroad’s continued use of the state-owned Moffat Tunnel, which crosses under the Continental Divide and serves as the only link between the eastern and western halves of the state’s rail network.
The year-round mountain rail route, which could eventually extend as far as Steamboat Springs, Hayden and Craig, will aim to build on the success of the Winter Park Express, a seasonal route that takes passengers from Denver to the Winter Park ski resort and back. Operated by Amtrak, the route was revived in 2017 and reached a new high in ridership during the 2025 ski season, state officials announced Friday. Trains averaged 89% full throughout the line’s three and a half months of operation, serving a total of 43,919 riders.
“We believe that increased ridership at this level is helping to take cars off congested roadways and make everyone safer,” Sally Chafee, CDOT’s acting director, said in a press release. “It also means much lower emissions per passenger mile, so there’s a huge environmental benefit here.”
Meanwhile, officials at the Front Range Passenger Rail District are moving forward with long-term plans for service between Pueblo and Fort Collins, with a vote on a district-wide sales tax hike to fund the project coming as soon as 2026. While the Denver-to-Fort Collins “starter service” could begin by 2029, a “full build” may still be decades away.
The district last week launched a virtual open house to invite Coloradans to give feedback on its service development plan, which it will complete by the end of this year. Out of five different alternatives studied by CDOT and FRPR staff, the district is recommending a plan that envisions a “full build” of 10 daily round trips along the proposed line by 2045. Members of the public are invited to share their thoughts on the alternatives analysis before June 15.
“This is an opportunity to better understand the recommended alternative and ask questions about the Service Development Plan,” said Chrissy Breit, FRPR’s interim general manager. “Community input is vital to shaping a transportation solution that reflects the region’s needs and priorities.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)In 2010, Rhode Island attempted a lively experiment in health care costs by limiting how much hospitals could increase the prices they charge. 
Fifteen years later, a new study led by a team of Brown University researchers suggests the hospital price growth mandate worked, not only cutting hospital prices directly, but flowing downstream to lower consumer spending on health plan premiums. 
By 2022, fully insured plan premiums in Rhode Island were $1,000 lower per member annually than they would have been without the cap, and hospitals saw a 9.1% average price drop between 2010 and 2022, according to the study published May 5 in the journal Health Affairs.
“No other states in recent history had attempted to regulate commercial prices in this way,” Andrew Ryan, the study’s lead author and a professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown’s School of Public Health, said in a recent phone interview. 
Ryan, who also directs the school’s Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research, said the study looked at both the impact of the hospital price growth cap on insurance premiums and on costs to employers and workers,
The hospital growth cap is part of the state’s affordability standards, which are set and overseen by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC). Using part of the statutory authority it was granted by the General Assembly, OHIC led a Health Insurance Advisory Council in 2009 that in turn authorized the 2010 creation of the regulatory package known as the affordability standards.

OHIC released its own annual health care spending report last Monday, and found soaring prices for hospitals in 2023 and a widening price gap between treatments delivered to hospital outpatients and those offered in other settings like standalone clinics.
In an interview ahead of the OHIC report’s release, Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King acknowledged the Health Affairs study and called the findings “significant,” as they underscore that even amid increased inflation and demand for medical services, the state still has “some levers in place to mitigate spending growth or cost growth” when it comes to hospitals.
Alas, not all consumers and companies have saved money under the 2010 affordability initiative, as not all health plans are made equal. The study found only “a modest impact on overall commercial premiums” because of differences in employee health insurance.
Employers generally offer two kinds of health plans. Rhode Island’s affordability standards only apply to fully insured plans, in which employers pay a fixed premium to an insurer and the insurer assumes the financial risk. This type of plan, Ryan said, might be chosen by smaller companies who “could go bankrupt if they have an employee that has a huge medical expense.” 
But larger companies are more likely to possess the capital to pay claims outright. That’s why big companies may opt to offer their employees self-insured plans, in which the company pays health claims directly, and contracts with insurance companies only to manage plan benefits. In this arrangement, insurers serve as third-party administrators who are paid fees to manage benefits and process claims. 
“The standards worked as intended in a fully insured market…but we didn’t really see that dynamic happen in the self-funded market,” Ryan said.
The study authors observed price reductions in the self-insured market.“There was kind of a spillover of the policy,” Ryan said. “Hospital prices fell in lockstep in the fully insured market.” 
But, he added, “When we looked at the effects on insurance premiums, we saw only a reduction in the fully insured market, not in the self-funded market.”
Before the affordability standards were enacted, there were on average 295,883 Rhode Islanders in fully insured plans. After the standards, the average dropped to 189,500 members. Today, OHIC data shows that self-insured plans account for about 60% of employee health plans statewide.
Self-insured plans are largely shielded from state intervention by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which established national rules so self-insured plans can operate under the same standards nationwide — a plus for companies which do business across state lines.
“For a company like Home Depot that has stores all over the country, that’s going to be self-funded, but there won’t be a Rhode Island premium equivalent,” Ryan said. “There’s like a national premium equivalent. Even if their own employees are spending less in Rhode Island, that reduction in spending is kind of being spread across their entire set of employees.”
ERISA rules preempt states from mandating more rigorous reporting or price controls, leaving local regulators in an awkward position — and largely in the dark, too — since data on what employers or contracted insurers do with possible hospital savings is limited, Ryan said.
“You hear employers really struggling to get reliable information from their third-party administrators about just basic things, about the prices that different providers are charging,” Ryan said.
Out-of-pocket spending decreased for both fully-funded and self-insured plans, for example — by about $2.9 million and $5.3 million annually, respectively— but it was hard to surmise exactly how those savings materialized. 
The study had to rely on estimations of self-funded costs, Ryan said, because self-insured plans don’t have to submit detailed spending data to state regulators like OHIC.
“Part of the issue here is these ERISA standards that basically make this segment almost totally unregulated,” Ryan said. “I think that this is, frankly, in need of revision, so that the whole number of stakeholders can have greater insight into what’s happening in that self-funded market.”
Hospitals take a hit
More obvious was the financial hit hospitals suffered. The researchers estimated that Rhode Island hospitals lost a combined $158.3 million in commercial revenue per year since the affordability standards were introduced — outpacing the $87.7 million in annual savings enjoyed by fully insured employers and their employees.
“When you reduce prices, you’re taking revenue from hospitals. It’s a simple calculation,” Ryan said. “If there’s a drop-off in clinical care or important operational capacity, then we worry about the impact of this kind of revenue loss. I think it’s still an open question, what kind of impact does this have on quality and operations.”
Since the OHIC standards debuted, Ryan and his team found that Rhode Island hospital operating margins averaged −0.4% by 2021, compared to a national average of 4.8%.
Reduced revenue’s effects on hospital services or access was not within the study’s scope, nor could the study determine if the pricing caps were too high or the hospital margins too low. 
“Whether Rhode Island hospitals’ margins are ‘too low’ can be determined only with more detailed financial information that was not available in our study,” the authors note. “Nonetheless, hospital price growth caps under the standards may need to be periodically recalibrated to avoid undue financial strain for hospitals.”
Ryan said people tend to think hospitals charge excessive prices.
“It doesn’t mean that all hospitals are doing great, and that some massive revenue losses can all be handled equally by hospitals,” Ryan said. “That’s certainly not the case.”
Howard Dulude, interim president of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, said in an email Friday that the association has not yet reviewed the Health Affairs report in full but offered a succinct take on the affordability standards.. 
“Rhode Island’s affordability standards have, over time, contributed to Rhode Island’s growing health care crisis,” Dulude wrote.
Dulude pointed to two pieces of legislation in the House and Senate’s Health Care Action Package that he called “an important first step in addressing this challenge and beginning to stabilize a system under increasing strain.”
Bill H5832 would expand OHIC’s authority to review and approve hospital contract rates with insurers, especially if annual increases exceed the Consumer Price Index plus 3%. It was heard before the House’s Health and Human Services Committee on April 1 and held for further study.  
Senate resolution S0873 would appropriate $90 million from the state’s general fund to raise Medicaid reimbursement rates for physicians and advanced practice providers. The resolution was introduced and referred to the Senate Committee on Finance on March 21. It is not directly related to OHIC or the affordability standards.

(Courtesy photo by Gary Mataronas Jr.)A bright red buoy near the entrance to Sakonnet Harbor has long served as a waypoint for lobsterman Gary Mataronas when sailing back to Little Compton on foggy days.
“It’s a tremendous aid to navigation,” Mataronas, a Little Compton town councilor, said in an interview. 

The U.S. Coast Guard will accept written comments on the proposed buoy removals through June 13, 2025. The proposed changes can be seen at www.bit.ly/D1Buoy. Comments can be sent via email to D01-SMB-DPWPublicComments@uscg.mil.

Which is why he and other Rhode Island mariners are concerned over a proposal from the U.S. Coast Guard to remove more than three dozen navigational buoys from the state’s waterways, including the Sakonnet River buoy.
“It’s actually a safety risk if they take that out,” Mataronas said. “A lot of these buoys put along the coastline were put there for a reason.”
The Coast Guard is seeking public comment on the proposal to discontinue 350 buoys in the waters between New York and Maine in an effort to modernize the navigation aids — most of which were deployed before modern GPS systems. That includes 38 buoys in the waters from Westerly to Sakonnet Point.
Rhode Island is home to roughly 400 buoys maintained by the Coast Guard.
Proposed buoy changes are intended to “support the navigational needs of the 21st century,” deliver efficient and economical service to manage vessel transit at an acceptable level of risk, according to the Coast Guard’s announcement.
“We recognize that discontinuation of buoys rightfully raises concerns from a variety of waterway users and thus we are also committed to enabling mariner input in the process,” Petty Officer 3rd Class Rajesh Harrilal, a Coast Guard spokesperson, said in an email to Rhode Island Current. “In fact, it is required.”
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) has similarly encouraged all commercial and recreational boaters and harbormasters to write to the Coast Guard by its mid-June deadline for public comment. 
“The Coast Guard’s goal should be to ensure safety through an effective, efficient, and resilient navigation system,” Reed said in a statement. “Rhode Islanders know these waters best, and their views should guide Coast Guard decision-making.”
Sail Newport Executive Director Brad Read wrote to the Coast Guard May 8 that buoys placed in Narragansett Bay are “crucial for safe maritime operations in the region.”
“Without these visual aids to navigation, there will be loss of property, there will be environmental damage from groundings, there will be personal injuries, and there will potentially be fatalities from taking out some of these very important beacons,” Read said in an interview.
He likened the Coast Guard’s buoy elimination proposal to taking exit signs off highways.
Most modern boats are equipped with electronic navigation and GPS, but a significant number of vessels in Narragansett Bay still lack that technology, Read said. That includes the 180-boat fleet at the Newport-based sailing education center.
“We want their heads out of the boat looking for those aids to navigation, looking for traffic that’s coming, making good decisions based on what they see with their eyes, not what they see on a screen,” Read said.
North Kingstown Harbormaster James Broccoli told Rhode Island Current that his office is still looking into the Coast Guard’s proposal, but is firmly against the removal of a buoy off Wickford Cove.
“When you’re approaching Wickford Cove, there’s a lot of lights in front of you from land,” he said. “That bell is really a good marker.”
In Little Compton, Mataronas said the Sakonnet River buoy also helps guide students learning to sail at the Sakonnet Yacht Club. Mataronas said removing the marker could lead boats into fish traps set up along the coastline between the breakwater and the beach during the summer.
“If you get over one of those, it can net your propeller and stop you dead in your tracks,” he said.

A rainbow appears after a March 31, 2023, tornado tore a path through Little Rock. (Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)In the 30 days after several damaging twisters hit Arkansas on March 14, the state saw nearly four times as many tornado warnings as Texas did.
The National Weather Service issued 144 warnings in Arkansas, compared to 39 in Texas from March 14 to April 14. Mississippi also recorded 144 warnings over the same period and Tennessee saw 125 warnings. Alabama noted 57 warnings.
It’s an indication that the classic “Tornado Alley” region — the area from central Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, so named because of the number of tornadoes there — is shifting eastward.
The shift is attributed to climate change, the warming of the Gulf of Mexico’s waters and a dip in the cold jet stream pattern.
Arkansas, scientists say, is nearly in the bull’s eye of a new tornado-prone area that’s referred to as “Dixie Alley.”  The region, which has seen a vast increase in tornadoes over the past several years, also encompasses Mississippi, Alabama and western Tennessee.
Weather Service survey teams have already confirmed 35 tornadoes have touched down in Arkansas through April. The state averages 42 twisters per year.
The storms have also been larger.  Arkansas was hit with two EF-4 twisters on March 14 — one in Jackson County and one in Izard County
The last time a tornado of that strength hit the state was on April 27, 2014, when a tornado cut a 41-mile path of destruction through western Pulaski County, Mayflower and Vilonia in Faulkner County, and on into White County. Sixteen people died in that storm.
Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, conducted research about the shift, authoring a paper in 2018 that noted the change. Since then, he’s continued to monitor the trend and says the trend is ongoing.
“It’s still more prevalent in the southeast,” he said. “And we’re seeing more evidence of that each year.”
 ‘Drying up’

Gensini tracked tornado reports from 1979 to 2018 for his initial study, but also noted atmospheric conditions in the areas at the time that were favorable for the formation of tornadoes.
Gensini blames a combination of weather phenomenon for the increase in Arkansas’ tornadoes. A drought in the southwest is taking away needed moisture for the formation of twisters in the traditional Tornado Alley region.
More than 67% of Arizona is experiencing “extreme” and “exceptional” drought conditions — the two highest levels of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Drought Monitor is based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln and records weather conditions and patterns weekly.
Three months ago, only 17% of Arizona was under the same two drought conditions. A year ago, the state was considered free from extreme and exceptional drought.
New Mexico, Texas and Utah have also seen increases in drought in their respective states. Thirty percent of Texas is in “extreme” and “exceptional” drought, an increase from 14% three months ago.
“The most intense levels of drought now cover a broad area from southeastern California, southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah through much of Arizona, New Mexico and the Texas Big Bend, said Richard Tinker, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, and the author of the latest drought report.
“The southern Great Plains are drying up,” Gensini added.
 Faster rate of change

The dry atmospheric conditions in the southwest create a dome of high pressure over the western U.S., sapping energy from the atmosphere and forcing potential tornado-producing systems to move further east. The jet stream, a strong current of frigid Arctic air, is also dipping further south into the Mississippi delta region because of the Southwestern drought.
Water temperature in the Gulf has also increased on average by one or two degrees, creating the moist, humid air needed for tornadoes.
“One or two degrees may not seem much. But think of the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees,” Gensini said, referring to the temperature when water freezes. “It’s early in the season, and the waters are warmer. That warm, humid air is heading into Arkansas where the air has been unstable already. It makes things more potent.
“We’re seeing weather pattern changes over the last 70 to 80 years that didn’t happen in 100,000 to 120,000 years before,” he said. “There is such a rapid rate of change, and it’s not lessening.”
Of the 144 warnings issued in Arkansas between March 14 and April 14, not all produced tornadoes, said Dennis Cavanaugh, the National Weather Service warning coordinator in North Little Rock.
In fact, the Weather Service strives to keep its “false alarm” rate of tornado warnings to less than 80%. Warnings are issued when Doppler weather radar picks up rotation in clouds, signature “inflow notches” that indicate the building of cyclonic air patterns, hail cores and other indicators.
The Weather Service also must balance the need to warn people while also not unnecessarily alarming them. Issue too many warnings that don’t produce tornadoes, and the public may become complacent and not heed future warnings as seriously.  John Robinson, a former Meteorologist in Charge at the North Little Rock station, used to say that more people were injured in tornadoes while gawking at clouds for confirmation of those tornadoes rather than seeking shelter when warnings were issued.
On the other side, if the Weather Service curtails its warnings and an unwarned tornado does form, results could be devastating.
“Radar can’t see tornadoes,” Cavanaugh said. “It can see circulation aloft when it’s likely a tornado is forming. If we wait to see the debris cloud from a tornado that’s on the ground to issue a warning, it’s much too late.”

 More hail

Cavanaugh said continued advances in technology should help the Weather Service lower its rate of false alarms. But the service will always rely on trained storm spotters who can see the lowering of wall clouds — a first step in the formation of tornadoes — and any circulation of clouds overhead.
“That’s really not applicable to this year,” he said of the fear that the scores of warnings issued may eventually be ignored. “I don’t think the average Arkansan thought he or she was not warned unnecessarily.”
During a round of storms one April evening, Ryan Vaughn, the meteorologist for KAIT8 in Jonesboro, was broadcasting live storm coverage. At one point, most of northeast Arkansas was placed under a myriad of tornado warnings.
Vaughn took a deep sigh on air.
“I don’t think I’ve ever said this before, but if you’re anywhere in northeast Arkansas, take cover now,” he told viewers.
Tornadoes are formed by opposing winds at various levels. Strong winds in opposite directions cause a shear and a horizontal column of air circulating overhead. Warm, humid air feeds the twister and eventually the column of air begins tilting vertically and lowering to become a destructive tornado.
And if the increase in tornadoes in Arkansas and the Delta is not enough, Gensini said the ingredients for twister formation should also cause larger hail storms.
Hail is formed inside supercell thunderstorms. The rising air inside a building storm lofts raindrops into freezing air. It causes hail, which falls to the ground. Many times, a frozen raindrop falls in the size of a pea or gravel. But with more convection inside the stronger storms, that pea-sized bit of hail is lofted over and over again inside the system, growing larger as more water freezes on it.
That’s what causes the golf ball- and baseball-sized hail and are indicative of stronger storms and tornadoes.
Gensini is about to embark on a 40-day field study this summer of hail storms.
“Tornadoes get all the attention on the news because of the visual destruction,” he said. “You see a path of destruction with shattered homes. But hail is much worse overall.  It damages roofs, cars and agriculture in a much larger area.
“I think the south and southeast will see a lot more problems in the years coming,” he said.

(Bob Wick/BLM/Public Domain Mark 1.0)As an ecologist and someone who grew up hiking Colorado’s foothills and enjoying its alpine streams, I’ve seen firsthand how our relationship with the land shapes who we are — and what we stand to lose. These landscapes aren’t just backdrops for recreation. They’re places of memory, meaning and sustenance.
And they’re at risk.
In May 2021, the Biden-Harris administration outlined a hopeful, ambitious vision: conserve 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030. Known as “30×30” or the America the Beautiful initiative, the goal was clear — work locally and voluntarily to conserve and restore the lands, waters and wildlife that support and sustain the country.
But when the Trump administration rescinded this federal directive, the coordinated momentum was lost. Now, it’s up to states like Colorado to carry this vision forward.

The 30×30 initiative goes far beyond drawing boundaries on a map. It’s about supporting Tribally-led restoration efforts that honor generations of stewardship. It’s about rewarding ranchers, farmers and forest owners who protect soil, water and biodiversity. It’s about investing in restoration and resilience projects that create jobs, buffer us from wildfire and drought, and strengthen our climate future. And it’s about ensuring every community — especially those historically excluded from public lands access — has nearby green spaces to connect with nature.
As someone who’s spent the past decade studying ecosystems and the species that depend on them, I can tell you: The stakes are real. Wildlife corridors are shrinking. Watersheds are drying. Pollinators and other keystone species are in decline. These aren’t distant problems. They’re happening right here, and they’re impacting the places we call home.
When I think about the future of conservation in Colorado, I think about the families I’ve met while working on ecological projects — the ranchers eager to pass healthy land on to their kids and the scientists and volunteers planting native species along fire-scarred slopes. These people aren’t waiting for action. They’re already doing the work. Now, we need policy to meet them there.
America the Beautiful has earned the support of Tribal leaders, organizations, and local officials across the country. But to make meaningful progress, we need state-level action that reflects those same values.
Fortunately, Colorado has a strong foundation. Programs and coalitions like Keep It Colorado, Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s Regional Partnerships Initiative, and the state’s Gross Conservation Easement tax credit program are already connecting the dots between conservation and community. But we can — and must — go further.
Let’s build on that momentum. Let’s invest in nature-based climate solutions. Let’s strengthen partnerships with Tribes, landowners and local governments. Let’s expand access to outdoor spaces and ensure the benefits of conservation flow to every Coloradan. And let’s commit — clearly and publicly — to protecting at least 30% of our state’s lands and waters by 2030.
Our future depends on how we treat the natural world today. The choices we make now will shape the rivers our children fish in, the mountains they hike, and the air they breathe. Colorado has a chance to lead. Let’s not miss it.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Soybean grower Jim Thompson said there is no way to replace a customer the size of China, but North Dakota farmers have more options than they did in the 2018 Trump administration trade war. 
The first Trump administration paid out $23 billion in relief to farmers who suffered a loss of trade because of high tariffs. Most of the North Dakota soybean crop has traditionally been shipped to China, the focal point of ongoing trade negotiations. 
According to the North Dakota Soybean Council, 90% of the state’s soybean production leaves North Dakota, with about two-thirds shipped to China and countries in Southeast Asia.
Soybean crushing plants create new marketing opportunities for farmers

But in recent years, two soybean crushing plants have opened in North Dakota, capable of crushing about half the soybeans grown in the state. 
“That’s huge for us, because now we’re not so dependent on China,” Thompson said. 
The Green Bison plant at Spiritwood and the North Dakota Soybean Processors near Casselton produce soybean oil for renewable fuels, soymeal for livestock feed and other products.
Thompson, who farms about 50 miles northwest of Fargo, has sold soybeans to the Casselton plant that opened in 2024.
Without the crush plants, “I’d have to think that our local cash price would be suffering quite a bit more than what it is,” Thompson said. 
The soybean market has been affected by the tariff policies, said Alan Poock, of the American Soybean Association. 
“With all the tariffs and everything going on, the prices have dropped,” Poock said of the soybean market. 
Poock is the director of the Asia Division for the World Initiative for Soy in Human Health. He was in Fargo this month as part of a soybean trade team hosting representatives from Cambodia and Kazakhstan. 
He emphasized the quality of the soybean grown in the Upper Midwest for livestock feed. 
The higher quality, specifically soybeans higher in amino acids, can mean better quality hogs or fish that are fed the soybean meal, Poock said. 
“I tell them, ‘Don’t look at the initial sticker cost … Look at your end result,’” Poock said.

Thompson said the trade teams are key to developing alternatives to China. 
“You can’t just replace that customer with a couple customers here and there. You need to expand your footprint into many different areas,” Thompson said. 
Exporting to small markets comes with some challenges. Poock notes that Kazakhstan is land-locked, so the soybean products will have to go by rail through other countries. Cambodia has ports, but not with the same size and capability of Chinese ports that can take huge shiploads of whole beans.  
Poock said Cambodia prefers soybeans to come in a container like those seen on railcars and cargo ships. 
The availability of containers and the cost of shipping could be a concern if the trade war drags on, he added 
“Right now, things are looking OK, but it seems like every day there’s a new announcement on tariffs or what is going on (with trade),” Poock said. “No one knows what’s going to happen.” 
The United States and China last week announced an agreement to temporarily slash the tariffs that had built up in recent weeks as negotiations continue. 
The China tariff effect has been delayed somewhat because the U.S. usually sells and ships soybeans to China later in the year. 
Nancy Johnson, executive director of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association, said this is the time of year when China is buying soybeans from South America, which is finishing up its growing season.  
The U.S. and China negotiated what is known as the Phase 1 agreement for soybean trade under the first Trump administration, which is still in place. 
While North Dakota has the shortest route of a major soybean growing state to ports on the Pacific, China tariffs are an issue for soybean growers nationwide. 
In the most recent marketing year, U.S. exporters shipped 46.1 million metric tons of soybeans to foreign markets, accounting for over $24 billion in sales. Of those exports, nearly 25 million tons of soybeans went to China — 54% of U.S. soybean exports. 
Those China exports total $13 billion in value, according to the American Soybean Association.
Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who is the American Soybean Association president, said in a post on the organization’s website after last week’s trade truce announcement that the 90-day pause on the increased tariffs will end in August — right before the U.S. harvest season. 
“We need the administration to continue its negotiations with China to find a long-term, sustainable solution that removes retaliatory tariffs and protects market access for our agricultural products,” Ragland said.

Josh Stein signed the Disaster Recovery Act of 2025 (Part 1) into law. (Photo via the Governor's Press Office)Under the Trump administration, the future of the U.S. disaster management agency is far from certain.
The White House has established a council to study the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The president has on multiple occasions said he would like to see it abolished altogether. And when the interim head of the agency told Congress earlier this month that he did not want to see it eliminated, he was swiftly ousted.
North Carolina’s Gov. Josh Stein has made it clear he’d like to see changes to FEMA, too. On Friday, he put those thoughts in a formal letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — outlining a series of recommendations as western North Carolina continues to recover from Hurricane Helene.
“There is no doubt that FEMA could be better and faster,” Stein wrote. “But let us improve it, not abolish it. As governor of a state vulnerable to hurricanes, flooding and other extreme weather, I know we cannot afford for FEMA to be eliminated.”
Among Stein’s suggestions: create a block grant program to let the agency get money out the door quickly and easily. States could submit pre-approved plans ahead of disasters in order to track spending.
And he wants FEMA money to immediately be able to go toward permanent repairs. In almost all cases, aid from the agency can only be used for temporary or pre-storm condition repairs.
As previously reported by NC Newsline, Stein’s administration asked FEMA earlier this year for money to build permanent housing. It was rejected, with a FEMA official citing the fact that “alternative housing options in North Carolina exist.”
The governor also recommended that the agency move away from reimbursement programs. FEMA’s current model forces “cash-strapped local governments to put up funding” for projects, Stein wrote, slowing recovery and often leaving those governments in financial straits.
And he recommended that the agency make it easier for individuals and households to apply for aid. FEMA should consider a “common application” that allows a person to more easily apply to aid across multiple programs and departments, he wrote.
As it rebuilds from the deadliest storm in state history, North Carolina has at times found itself at odds with FEMA under the new administration. The agency denied a request to extend full reimbursement on debris cleanup earlier this year; the state has appealed that decision.
Stein is not the first North Carolina official to recommend fixes for FEMA. U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, a Republican who represents the region hardest hit by Helene, has sent a list of proposals of his own. But Edwards later cancelled a planned press conference after the White House said it needed more time to review his recommendations, the Asheville Citizen Times reported.
Among Edwards’ recommendations: forgiving loans to families and small businesses, loosening building codes and reimbursement for property owners and the state.
And last week, more than 80 lawmakers from both parties — including Edwards and North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis — signed a letter calling on FEMA to begin spending money already approved by Congress for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. As with Stein, the letter called for improved programming from the agency.
While the program “has room for improvement,” the lawmakers wrote, FEMA and Congress should work together “to improve the application review and funding distribution process to more effectively reduce the costs disasters pose to our communities, economies, and livelihoods.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/unnamed11-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 05:59:10.259497

(Photo by Rise To It Productions, Courtesy of Children’s Friend)I am a nurse in the First Connections program at Children’s Friend. I recently spoke at Home Visiting Day at the Rhode Island State House and joined Rep. Joshua Giraldo, a Central Falls Democrat, on the floor of the House for the reading of a resolution commemorating May 8 as Home Visiting Day. Home visiting programs are designed to support families during the crucial early days and years of a child’s life. Nurses like me, along with social workers and family support specialists, bring our expertise directly into a client’s home — making home visiting one of the most accessible forms of support available to new parents. 
Unfortunately, most new parents don’t even know this kind of help exists. 
Last year, the Rhode Island Legislature included updated rates for First Connections in the fiscal year 2025 budget, which effectively saved the program. I am incredibly grateful for this investment. However, significant challenges remain. 
Uncertainty at the federal level, combined with Rhode Island’s shift to a new fee-for-service Medicaid model, continues to strain our ability to deliver services. That’s why passing the RI Home Visiting Act (H6073/S677) is more critical than ever. This legislation would require the state to invest enough to qualify for the maximum federal match. The federal government contributes $3 for every $1 contributed by the state. If the state allocates $356,000 for family home visiting in the fiscal year 2026 budget, that would generate $1.1 million in federal funding. Right now, Rhode Island is one of just three states leaving that money on the table. The other two states are North Dakota and Tennessee.
I believe the lack of investment is simply a lack of awareness. More people need to understand just how vital these programs are. First Connections provides peace of mind and essential support to new parents across the socioeconomic spectrum. This includes addressing the mental and physical health needs of postpartum mothers. 
Through First Connections, I’ve visited families who needed help with the basics: safe sleep, breastfeeding, diapering. I’ve also walked into homes where mothers or babies were in acute medical crisis: dangerously high blood pressure, infant dehydration, undiagnosed postpartum mood disorders, infected C-section incisions. In those cases, serious illness — or even death — could have been the outcome. But it wasn’t, because First Connections was there. Being able to guide and intervene at such a critical moment in a family’s life is deeply fulfilling.  










I believe the lack of investment is simply a lack of awareness. More people need to understand just how vital these programs are.


First Connections is a short-term program, which covers up to three visits. It’s crisis management and an essential connection to longer-term resources for many families. At Children’s Friend, nearly 40% of the families we serve through First Connections are referred to longer-term home visiting programs, like Healthy Families America and Early Head Start. In some cases, we also refer older siblings for Early Intervention services after observing developmental challenges in their home environment.  
Take Maryam’s story for example: 
We visited Maryam and her family just days after she gave birth to her son, Eli. Our priority was making sure both mom and baby were safe and healthy. For Maryam, that meant helping her get to a doctor to refill a critical medication for a pre-existing condition. For Eli, we secured a pediatrician and helped resolve a health insurance issue caused by an error on his birth certificate. We also made sure the older children were safe by installing locks and screens on windows and doors. 
Without First Connections, Maryam’s health and Eli’s development could have been seriously at risk. For Maryam and Eli, three visits weren’t enough, so we connected the family with Early Head Start, a longer-term home visiting program at Children’s Friend. Now, the entire family receives ongoing education and support alongside other families with young children. 
According to a report by the Department of Health, we are only reaching a quarter of the most vulnerable children in our state through home visiting programs. My hope is that awareness will improve participation in these life-changing programs.  
I consider nursing my life’s calling. Through home visiting, I’m not only helping to ensure the immediate health of moms and babies, but I’m working to build stronger, healthier futures for entire families.

Pictured from left are Pria Dua, Charles Alexander, Bett Kilby and Elizabeth Kidd. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A state historical marker titled “Resilience Amid Resistance” now stands on the Western District U.S. Courthouse grounds in Harrisonburg, where a Virginia judge twice upheld the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to desegregate schools in America, allowing local Black students to attend white schools and access an equal education.
Betty Kilby was the lead plaintiff in one of the Virginia cases stemming from localities’ failure to comply with the high court’s Brown v. Board of Education ruling, part of the state’s Massive Resistance policy to buck desegregation, history referenced in the marker unveiled on Saturday. At the unveiling ceremony, Kilby said that when her father James Wilson lost his land and lived an enslaved lifestyle, he vowed his children would have a better life and fought in court to get them an education equal in quality to that of the white children in Warren County, where the family lived. 

A judge ruled in the family’s favor, ordering Kilby’s local high school to be integrated, according to a personal narrative Kilby shared with the American Psychological Association. Although the state then closed the school for six months to delay Black and white pupils learning together, the Virginia Supreme Court dismantled Massive Resistance in January 1959 and the school reopened, with Kilby and 22 other Black students attending at first by themselves and then alongside white students. 
Attending the desegregated school from 8th grade to her senior year was traumatic and intimidating, Kilby recalled at the event, saying she had been called names and was attacked by white students.
“It was pretty consistent all five years, and it got worse in my senior year because my whole attitude changed,” said Kilby. “I didn’t care whether I lived or died.”
The marker’s unveiling in the city of Harrisonburg fell on the anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision that declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional. The emblem of Virginia’s fraught educational history was the brainchild of two then-high school students, as part of the Farmville Tour Guides Project. The project’s goal is to connect modern-day students with the stories of students who lived through the turbulent Civil Rights Era and paved the way for generations of integrated education.
“We wanted to keep going solely for the reason of continuing to be able to share their story,” said Pria Dua, a Rockingham County Public Schools graduate, adding that she and her collaborators wanted to make the monumental court desegregation decisions a permanent symbol.
Elizabeth Kidd, a Rockingham County graduate who worked with Dua, said the two met many “incredible people” during the research process. She said it was only fitting to support telling their stories.
“A lot of them, still today, are still trying to get their story out there, or make known this history that happened and I think the marker was kind of just like sitting there for us as a way for us to keep working,” Kidd said. 
 Marker illuminates Black Virginians’ struggle for equal education

Although it was a lengthy process, Kidd and Dua said one of the keys to installing the marker was the support they received — from the community, lawmakers including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and U.S. Rep. Ben Cline, R-Botetourt, and the Virginia Board of Historic Resources, which approved the manufacture and installation of the historical marker last September.
Virginia has more than 2,600 state markers, which are primarily maintained by the Virginia Department of Transportation, according to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, except in those localities outside of VDOT’s authority.
Rocktown History, a museum, archive and genealogy library, covered the unspecified costs of the marker. According to the Department of Historic Resources, the cost to create a marker is approximately $3,000. For localities outside of VDOT’s jurisdiction, there is a $415 charge for the post.
The students worked with Harrisonburg City Council, judges at the federal court, Virginia Board of Education member and former Virginia Secretary of Education Anne Holton and Kaine to obtain approval for the marker to be placed on federal property.
The Farmville Tour Guides Project, the student-led independent study that has operated for over a year and one of the driving forces behind the new marker, allows students to explore Virginia’s Civil Rights history through accounts of figures like Barbara Johns. In 1951, Johns led a student strike at R.R. Moton High School in Prince Edward County in protest of the unequal conditions of her segregated school. The protest, along with lawsuits by the NAACP, were crucial to the success of the Brown v. Board of Education case.

Joan Johns Cobbs, a Moton student striker, plaintiff in the Brown v. Board case and the sister of the late Barbara Johns, was one of several guests at Saturday’s ceremony. 
Other guests included Charles Alexander, the youngest plaintiff in the Allen v. Charlottesville case, in which federal judge John Paul Jr. issued the first school desegregation order in the commonwealth to favor the NAACP against Charlottesville City Public Schools. Alexander is a member of the “Charlottesville 12,” named for the first 12 Black students who attended the city’s all-white public schools in 1959. Ann Rhodes Baltimore, the first Black graduate of a desegregated school in Virginia, was also present.
With cases of Black history being omitted or minimized in school curricula, Alexander told the Mercury before Saturday’s marker unveiling, it’s important to continue passing on such historical stories of segregation and discrimination.
He hopes the public would remember the story of his fellow plaintiffs, similar to that of Ruby Bridges, the first Black child to desegregate an all-white school in the South.
“We just didn’t all of a sudden appear; there were folks that sacrificed, gave up their jobs and made a commitment for this to come about, and so we need to share that,” Alexander said. 
The Farmville Tour Guides Project also stemmed from a desire for students to learn about Black Virginians’ historic struggle for equal educational opportunity. The project was founded in 2015 by Beau Dickenson, supervisor of history studies at Rockingham County Public Schools, and history teacher Owen Longacre at Spotswood High School in Rockingham County.
Dickenson said both educators were surprised to see that the Moton story was not covered in Virginia’s public education curriculum, which spurred them into action.
“We just thought that that was such a tragic shame given the significance of that event,” Dickenson said. “It felt like it had been omitted from history. So we wanted to amplify that story, but we also because of the nature of that story thought this has to be something different than just a field trip. This needs to be something that’s active and engaged.”
Dua and Kidd also worked with three other students on the Knocking Down Walls documentary about school desegregation featured nationally on Good Morning America.

Board of Education case, which ruled that segregation in schools was unconstitutional. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)
Holton, the event’s keynote speaker, said amid the concerns and questions about how students are doing in Virginia’s public schools, students like Dua and Kidd are examples of incredible work pupils in the state are undertaking. Holton is the daughter of former Gov. Linwood Holton, who ended Massive Resistance in Virginia.
“I’m going to be at a Board of Education meeting next week (and) I’m going to tell them that the kids are all right,” Holton said. “ The future is in great hands, and these incredible teachers — this is public education at its best.”
Holton also talked about the courage of the plaintiffs, the attorneys, and judges in desegregation cases. She said judges were threatened and one even had a cross burned in front of their home,  a once-common practice of the white supremacist terror group, the Ku Klux Klan. 
Holton said she hopes judges in Harrisonburg, and nationwide, “will be inspired by this marker every day as they walk past it going into the courthouse and courthouses like it all across the country to that resilience amid resistance that we all need to have that’s so crucial to what makes our country work.” 
Saturday’s unveiling, hosted by Rockingham County Public Schools, Rocktown History, and the City of Harrisonburg, was capped off with students from the Farmville Tour Guides Project presenting a companion exhibition on the fight for school equality across Virginia at the Moton Museum in Farmville, formerly the high school where Johns led the historic student protest. 
Dickenson said the exhibit showcases how students are engaging in civic life and using history to inform action.
Cainan Townsend, executive director for the Moton Museum, said the efforts by area students to apply for the marker, develop a museum exhibit and seek out historical information have been impressive. 
“I think it’s really young people deciding that our history is more than battle sites,” Townsend said. “Our history is more than just these 10, 15 (and) 20 people you think are important. There are important stories from all parts of Virginia, and by increasing the volume and the diversity of these historical markers, I think that’s a great way to show that.”

Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia MercuryWhen Denodra Bennett stepped into Another Level Barbershop and Cosmetology School in Petersburg on Friday morning for a haircut, she didn’t realize she would also be leaving with a shifted perspective on her health and reminder to set up her next doctor’s appointment. 
The experience stemmed from a partnership between the American Heart Association, Aetna Better Health of Virginia and Capital Area Health Network to raise awareness about hypertension and encourage community members to keep tabs on their blood pressure and heart health. Petersburg, recently dubbed a “Healthy Hearts City,” is making strides to address heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death in the locality. 
Bennett, a Chesterfield County resident, took advantage of health professionals’ presence at the shop to have her blood pressure checked and was surprised to learn it was slightly elevated. 
It’s never been an issue for her before, she said, but feels like she’s been “slacking” on her diet and fitness lately.  
“I would say ‘don’t assume that your health is where you think it is, you need to actually go and let that professional check you out,’” she said. 
Likewise, Archie Robinson got his levels checked by happenstance when he came in for his haircut Friday. Participants received $5 dollars off their trims at ALBC that day. 










You take care of your car maintenance every three to four months. You have to take care of your body like that, because if you neglect your medical needs, it's gonna eventually break down on you, and we don't want that to happen.


– Capital Area Health Network outreach coordinator Robin Tyler


Wesley Nicholas Jr., who owns the shop with his wife Candace, said that he was excited to coordinate with the health professionals for the event. The couple frequently utilizes their shop for community engagement events with their spirituality a key role, so when CAHN outreach coordinator Robin Tyler approached them about hosting the heart health awareness event, they were all in. 
“Miss Robin and her team are always out in the community doing great things. So she explained to me about awareness of high blood pressure and I said ‘I think  that’s something we can work together on,’” Nicholas explained.  “The awareness that we bring into our community and to our customers are so exciting to help to realize that we can save someone’s life, or they can save their own.”
Nearly half of adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure, which puts them at a higher risk for heart attacks or strokes. Research shows high blood pressure is more prevalent in Black communities, in part from systemic racism’s impact on people’s lives. Examples include historic redlining, which  decades ago determined where many Black people could live and how resources like public transportation, road improvements, and access to healthy foods were invested in their neighborhood. 
For anyone with hypertension, their high blood pressure can be hard to detect without blood pressure checks. The condition can be managed through medication or lifestyle changes, depending on patients’ specific needs. 
Offering health care services outside of a doctor’s office is important, Tyler said, because heart issues associated with high blood pressure can be tricky to detect without regular checkups. 
“You take care of your car maintenance every three to four months. You have to take care of your body like that, because if you neglect your medical needs, it’s gonna eventually break down on you, and we don’t want that to happen,” she said. 
By addressing preventable or manageable health issues like high blood pressure, Tyler hopes to avert people from needing to accrue costly emergency room visits down the line. It’s an especially needed service: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control identified parts of Petersburg as having the highest rate of hypertension in Virginia, the Progress-Index reported. 
In her role with the federally qualified health center, Tyler regularly engages Petersburg-area residents to connect them to the CAHN clinics or their own health care providers. 
Likewise, it’s Angela Taylor’s job as senior community impact director with the American Heart Association to coordinate with local organizations on initiatives like the heart health awareness campaigns taking place in area barber shops and beauty salons. 
It’s one facet of helping to break down barriers to accessing health care, she said. Sometimes emotional reservations keep people from making doctor’s visits, and transportation or financial access issues can also be a challenge. Local communal hubs like the Nicholas’ barbershop can be an entry point for people to seek further assistance, be reminded to keep up regular physician visits and gain tips to improve their heart health.
“Our goal with doing these community blood pressure stations is truly to meet people where they are,” Taylor said.

(Charlie Paullin/VirginiaMercury)On May 5, attorneys general from 17 states and the District of Columbia — not including Virginia, regrettably —  sued the Trump administration over its attacks on the wind industry. The lawsuit challenges an executive order, signed by President Donald J. Trump on his first day in office, stopping all approvals, permits and funding for wind projects across the country and offshore. 
Since the order was signed, the administration hasn’t just blocked new projects, it’s issued a stop-work order for one project under construction in New York and revoked a permit for another. The actions inflict enormous damage on the wind industry and on the economies of states that need the energy and jobs this industry could deliver.
One state that will lose big under Trump’s order is Virginia, which has positioned itself to be a national leader in offshore wind deployment, supply chain and manufacturing. On top of that, Virginia badly needs the electricity from offshore wind to help meet the demand from data centers; it can’t afford to have a major new source of energy strangled in its infancy. Yet Attorney General Jason Miyares did not join the lawsuit.
Will special rate classes protect Va. residents from the costs of serving data centers?

Sure, Miyares wants to be a good soldier in the Trump putsch. And no doubt he wouldn’t feel at home among all those Democratic AGs (there were no Republicans signing the complaint). But he could at least speak up in his state’s interest. Some well-timed advocacy would go a long way in showing the administration that wind energy is not a partisan matter. 
It doesn’t have to be just our attorney general, either. The silence from Gov. Glen Youngkin has been equally deafening. What are they afraid of? Youngkin can’t run for reelection, and Miyares has already secured his party’s nomination in his bid for reelection this fall.
Youngkin vetoes clean energy bills supported by Dominion, environmental groups

Any politician who styles himself as pro-business ought to be pushing back on the Trump administration’s interference with contracts, destruction of American jobs and infliction of billions of dollars in damage to a growing domestic industry. Especially when it is happening to their own state, the big risk is in not speaking out.
And let’s face it, attacking wind energy is Trump’s own peculiar hobbyhorse, not his party’s. Though Republican support for wind energy has dropped a bit in recent years, it remains above 50%. Onshore wind is the largest source of electricity in Iowa and South Dakota and a major source in several other Republican strongholds. Wind power is responsible for billions of dollars in economic investment while keeping utility rates low in states that rely on it. 
Offshore wind is more expensive, but states have embraced it for its potential to lower electricity bills over time while relieving grid congestion, creating well-paying jobs and providing clean, zero-carbon power to East Coast cities. Thirteen states have established offshore wind development goals, totaling over 112 gigawatts (GW) by 2050. 
In Virginia, Republican leaders have been among the biggest boosters of offshore wind for more than 15 years. Legislators from both parties supported the creation of the Virginia Offshore Wind Development Authority. With a boost from then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, the Virginia Department of Energy partnered with Dominion Energy on a research project that produced the nation’s first offshore wind turbines in federal waters. Republican support also paved the way for Dominion’s development of the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, now more than halfway to completion and expected to begin delivering electricity next year. 
Nor is CVOW a one-off; the Virginia Clean Economy Act declares twice as much offshore wind power to be “in the public interest.” At the offshore wind International Partnering Forum held in Virginia Beach last month, Dominion displayed a poster of the projects it has in the works. These include a project off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, which Dominion acquired last October, as well as a huge lease area east of CVOW, which Dominion secured in a lease auction from the federal government last August. All told, Dominion’s projects could deliver a total of 9 GW of clean, renewable power. 
As important as the energy itself is, Virginia leaders believe offshore wind can be a driver of economic development and job creation for the Hampton Roads area. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership touts Virginia’s strategic location, strong maritime industry and ready workforce as draws for businesses up and down the offshore wind supply chain.
Some businesses have already set up shop in Virginia to serve the industry. These include most recently a Korean subsea cable manufacturer that is investing almost $700 million for a facility in Chesapeake. Gov. Glen Youngkin was on hand for the groundbreaking last month, calling it “a proud moment for Virginia.” Attracting the company was only possible because of Virginia’s commitment to the wind industry – as well as the availability of federal tax credits that Trump also intends to eliminate. 
CVOW will likely survive Trump’s attacks (albeit at a higher cost due to his tariffs), but Virginia’s ability to develop an offshore wind workforce and supply chain are very much at risk. The Trump administration’s war on wind power already threatens developers with losses in the billions of dollars. With permitting at a halt, companies are headed for the exits instead of creating the project pipeline necessary for offshore wind to become the powerhouse industry that it is in Europe and Asia.
Trump may have planned his economic sabotage to hurt northeastern states with Democratic governors, but the collateral damage to Virginia is considerable. As it is, our economy has taken a hit from Trump’s mass firings of federal workers, thousands of whom live here. We can’t afford to lose four years of offshore wind progress for no better reason than that Trump wills it. 
Silence is not an acceptable response. Miyares and Youngkin must speak up for Virginia.

(Photo by Chip Jackson/Richmond Public Schools)A state grant program called Safe Routes to Schools, which funds crossing guard training, teaches students how to safely ride a bike and sponsors walk and bike to school days, has gone through a metamorphosis that could put the brakes on those initiatives.
Safe Routes to Schools was created in 2005 under the federal Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act but got an influx of funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which was passed in 2021. 
Safe Routes to School funds Fit4Kids, an initiative promoting a healthy lifestyle through nutrition and movement implemented in Central Virginia school districts including in the cities of Richmond, Hopewell and Petersburg, and Chesterfield and Henrico Counties.
“Fit4Kids has been the Safe Routes to School program for the city of Richmond for about 10 years,” said Mary Dunne Stewart, chief executive officer of Greater Richmond Fit4Kids. 
Stewart said in that time, they were able to grow it from a small pilot program, to a district-wide one that trains more than 100 crossing guards and teaches 750 students annually in their Learn to Bike program.

In Harrisonburg, project coordinator Andrea Troyer said though their program has been “on and off” for 10 years, and was originally led by a part-time coordinator. But because of a SRTS grant, they were able to hire her as a full-time coordinator back in November. Since then, she’s been trying to restart the bike program.
“One of the big things that’s been a success, is the education around students in their bike units,” she said. I was coming from a school that had started up their bike unit for the first time in six years. And so it’s really exciting to kind of see the excitement from teachers, administrators, students, (and) from parents.”
A major change to how program facilitators request funding and use it has left them unsure if they’ll be able to grow their outreach efforts in the fiscal years of 2027-28. 
Stewart said in the beginning, the Fit4Kids program was funded in a certain way.
“It used to be funded by a specific line item at VDOT that was for Safe Routes to School with federal funding. And that funding went away about three years ago,” Stewart said.
According to Jessica Cowardin, assistant director of communications for the Virginia Department of Transportation, when federal funding for the SRTS program was eliminated, the activities under the program became eligible under the Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP).
“Because dedicated SRTS funding has not been federally reestablished, all SRTS projects must be administered in accordance with the federal TAP guidance,” Cowardin said in an email to Virginia Mercury. 
Stewart thought the change was “great,” and  said the funding stream still allowed localities to apply for various bike, pedestrian and infrastructure projects. But the issue is in the numbers.
 How Fit4Kids and other programs get grant funding, and the challenges with the process

Normally when requesting funds, programs such as Fit4Kids work in conjunction with city departments. In Richmond, for example, it’s the Department of Public Works. In turn, DPW piggybacks Fit4Kids requests into their bigger pile of funding requests for infrastructure projects.
In the past, localities could request funding for up to 11 projects. But now, that number has dwindled to five. This means projects under TAP have to compete with the larger, more expensive infrastructure projects cities need money for.
The purpose of the change, some local leaders said, remains unclear. 
“We’re trying to figure out, why is this happening? Is this a big picture strategy decision from the governor’s office or from the Secretary of Transportation? Or is this kind of a mid-level decision?” asked Stewart. “The only response we’ve gotten is that they’re trying to incentivize new programs.”
Cowardin of VDOT said they have to administer TAP funding in accordance with federal and state code and in line with policies established by Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB), which were last updated in summer of 2023. She said the change in maximum TAP applications to five per cycle went into effect this year. 
This drastic application reduction spurred major concern for Justine Blincoe, policy director of Richmond’s Fit4Kids. She said her organization has had a great relationship with DPW over years but the cap on grant applications they can submit threatens it.
“Because the city of Richmond is kind of earmarking one of the project submissions for us each year, if they were limited to doing five project submissions versus two times that amount, it would really limit their opportunity to be able to apply for other higher cost projects,” she said. 
Blincoe said if you compare the cost of a big paving project to how much money Safe Routes to School needs to operate, for example, it’s possible the youth biking programs will be left out. 
“It just really kind of puts into perspective that they could be losing out on opportunities to apply for something that’s higher cost. And it really kind of disincentivizes localities to partner with a Safe Routes to School program to be able to do this,” Blincoe said. 
Because of the uncertainty of being left out of funding, Stewart met with representatives from Richmond Public Schools on May 13.
“I’m meeting with RPS to ask them to be the applicant instead of DPW,” she said to Virginia Mercury in an email ahead of the discussion. “I feel very uneasy asking DPW to forgo a much more expensive project for a VERY low reimbursement rate for SRTS.”
The day after that meeting, Stewart said RPS agreed to be the lead applicant in future applications.

Everyone knows the state legislature must operate under a set of parliamentary rules and procedures. After all, maintaining order in a large group of opinionated and talkative politicians is no easy feat.
That said, when the rules become so numerous, complex and restrictive that they make majority rule effectively impossible, they’ve gone too far and right now, that’s the case in the North Carolina House of Representatives.
Last week, House leaders rolled out their new state budget proposal in a series of appropriations subcommittees and, at least in theory, opened it up to debate and amendment.
Unfortunately, there was catch: a long list of restrictive rules that barred even the consideration of most meaningful amendments.
For example, no amendment to spend additional dollars was allowed unless it reduced another line item from a very restricted list by the same amount – even if a majority of lawmakers wanted to do so.
The bottom line: In representative government, the majority is supposed to rule. In the North Carolina House a list of anti-democratic restrictions make sure that’s not the case.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)As Ohioans pleaded for more support for the state’s public libraries, there was also outcry against a provision that library staff and supporters say would add more work and unnecessary regulations to the local institutions.
The Ohio House added a provision to their budget draft that was not in the governor’s executive proposal, one that would require public libraries to place “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression in a portion of the library that is not primarily open to the view of minors.”
As budget plans move through the Ohio Senate, state residents asked the chamber to push back on the House’s proposal and eliminate the provision in their own draft.
Librarians who spoke at the Senate Education Committee last week noted the vague language of the provision, and tried to give legislators an idea of the heavy lift this might mean for libraries. Library visitors and advocates criticized the provision as targeted toward LGBTQ+ content, such as transgender issues.
“Books are an outlet, an escape,” said Bree Taylor, founder and executive director of the non-profit transgender advocacy groups Trans Unity Coalition. “A children’s book isn’t going to turn a kid gay or trans, but it will bring comfort to a kid who already is.”
Toledo resident Erin Prestwich said the idea of separating out the content speaks not only to keeping children from accessing content some may find objectionable because of its connection to LGBTQ+ issues, but to simply keeping children from seeing perspectives that match their own.
“I ‘acted like a boy’ as a child, like climbing trees, playing with trucks in the dirt,” Prestwich wrote to the committee. “I am not transgender, and never thought that I was, but I did enjoy reading books as a child (with characters) who did things that I wanted to do. That is normal. It is important for children to read about characters that are like them.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe libraries themselves spoke to the already existing ways in which parents can control a child’s access to certain materials. Library systems have collections and purchasing policies that come with opportunities for public feedback and input, and many libraries have tiered library cards based on the amount of access a parent wants a child to have.
“While libraries do provide access to information, we do not act ‘in loco parentis,’” said Jay Smith, director of government and legal services for the Ohio Library Council. “We do not act in the place of the parent or guardian. Parents and guardians play a vital role in determining what their children are reading and have a right to determine what is best for their child.”
Amelia Green, who identified herself as a married transgender woman who plans to raise children in Ohio, agreed that parents should be the deciding factor in what children have access to, not state leaders.
“This provision is not just misguided – it is a violation of parental rights,” Green told the committee. “As a future parent, it should be my right – not the government’s – to decide how and when I introduce my children to stories about people like their parents, their friends and potentially themselves.”
Green also said the language contained in the state budget proposal would mean taking her children past “actual adult material” just to find “a simple picture book about a kid with two moms, or a young adult novel with a trans protagonist.”
“That’s absurd,” she said. “Queer stories are not adult content – they are human content.”
Funding the provision
As libraries face an uncertain financial future while they wait for the state to decide whether or not to fund the Public Library Fund, the provision to separate out certain content could come with its own financial load.
The House budget draft noted “potential costs” for identifying and relocating the “restricted materials.”
With no additional funds added alongside the proposed changes, library staff said moving books based on their content would be extremely costly in some cases and in other cases nearly impossible, based on the limited space in branch libraries.
Paula Brehm-Heeger, director of the Cincinnati & Hamilton County Public Library, said she recently visited one of the smaller libraries in her system, and could see the entire library as soon as she entered it. Even if separating the materials is possible, the cost at the southwestern Ohio library system would “likely be upwards of $1 million per year, adjusting for inflation and current library procedures,” according to Brehm-Heeger.
Having the provision in place with the vague language as it stands would lead to “inconsistent and arbitrary enforcement across Ohio,” Lauren Hagan, CEO of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, told the committee. Her team could only make an “educated guess” at the financial impact such a policy would have.
“We anticipate the initial cost for compliance at $3.14 million, with continuing costs of approximately $1.7 million every year,” Hagan said.
The Senate is still working on their budget draft, expected to be released in the coming weeks, with a deadline for a final draft combining the House and Senate priorities due by the end of June.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Howard Pearl said, ""We have to sometimes make that tough decision to slow things down just a little bit."" (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)It’s boxy, angular, and typically yellow. And when it lights up on a car dashboard, the next step is often hundreds of dollars in repairs.
But some in New Hampshire believe the “check engine” light is not always reliable, and that its presence can cause vehicles to fail their state inspection even when everything is working fine. 
“That has been weaponized by this (inspection) program,” said Paul Wolf, one of dozens who spoke at a Senate hearing recently. “A hood latch out, or AC refrigerant low would set that light off.”
That sentiment is part of what’s driving an effort to end mandatory annual state vehicle inspections altogether. A bill to do so passed the House in March. 
But on Thursday, the Senate applied the brakes and retained the bill, arguing it needed a little more work. That action would delay passage of the bill until early 2026 at the earliest. But the issue could return in the June negotiations between the House and Senate over passage of the two-year budget.
Some senators were frustrated, citing constituents who feel burdened by the inspection costs.
“We owe it to them to fix this problem,” said Sen. Tim McGough, a Merrimack Republican. “We’ve inspected it and inspected it. It’s time to fix it. The time is now to get it fixed.” As passed by the House, the bill would end New Hampshire’s mandatory state inspection system, in which vehicles must pass inspections in the owner’s birth month and a windshield sticker displays that compliance.
Supporters of the repeal say inspections are costly and unnecessary, and that drivers can safely maintain their cars without them. They have cited reviews and studies that suggest there is no correlation between mandatory inspection laws and lower traffic accidents and fatalities. And they argue the inspection law largely benefits car dealerships and mechanic shops. 
Opponents of the law, who include the New Hampshire State Police and many industry groups, say the inspections help identify vehicle safety issues that could lead to crashes, and that they help the environment by reducing harmful emissions. 
But while the House had pushed for an all-out repeal of the inspections, some Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee had favored a shift toward requiring the inspections every other year, instead. That disagreement — which included a last-ditch attempt at an amendment — in addition to opposition to the entire idea from Democrats, doomed the bill on Thursday.
“It’s a challenge for us, but when a bill isn’t ready, a bill isn’t ready, and that’s the hard part,” said Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican who said he supported the main objectives of the bill. “And … we have to sometimes make that tough decision to slow things down just a little bit.”
In 2023, 1,048,001 million vehicles were registered in New Hampshire, according to the Department of Safety. 
New Hampshire is one of 14 states that require car inspections either every year or every other year. Most of those states are in the Northeast; the list includes Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts.
Those in support of repealing the car inspection requirement have pointed to states that had mandatory inspections and then eliminated them. 
They argue the inspection creates the potential for conflicts of interest, since vehicle repair shops carry out both the inspections and the necessary repairs.
Some advocated for state employees to conduct the inspections, so that the diagnoses are more impartial. 
“Other states do this,” said Wolf. “They hire their own technicians, and all they do is inspect. They don’t do the work. There’s no conflict of interest.”
Supporters of the law have also raised issues with certain diagnostic lights that must be addressed before a car can pass inspection — in particular, the check engine light. Advocates for repealing the inspections say that indicator can often be a false alarm. 
Repealing the inspection would cost the state about $3.4 million of revenue a year, according to the Department of Safety. About 85% of that revenue goes into the Highway Fund, while the rest is split between the motor vehicle air pollution abatement fund and the general fund. 
Of the amount that goes to the highway fund, 12% — or about $346,500 a year — is distributed to cities and towns, according to the department.
But the bill has also created a backlash, with 489 people registering their opposition to the bill over two Senate committee hearings, compared to 129 people supporting it.
Those opposed include the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Environmental Services, the New Hampshire Motorcyclists’ Rights Organization, the New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association, and a number of individual vehicle repair businesses.
“House Bill 649 seeks to shift the responsibility of identifying unsafe vehicles entirely onto law enforcement, placing an undue burden on troopers who are already stretched thin, expecting them to spot mechanical issues during routine patrols without the tools, time, or training of a licensed inspector,” said New Hampshire State Police Captain Matthew Amatucci, speaking in a Senate hearing last month. 
Relying on police to catch problems, Amatucci said, “means that the danger has already reached the road.” 
David Dupont, who founded Dupont’s Service Center in Dover but has since retired, said the inspections catch a number of flaws or broken parts, especially with older vehicles and motorcycles. And he said the indicator lights do serve a purpose. 
“The check engine light is more than just a light,” he said. “It’s telling you that the vehicle is polluting more. It’s telling you that the consumer is not getting optimal fuel economy, and the vehicle emissions most likely are out of compliance. How is that good for New Hampshire?”
Dupont also pushed back against the idea that repair shops are engaging in fraud, noting that there is a legal penalty for fraudulent inspections that can lead to misdemeanor charges. 
“We’re held to a standard, and no one wants to end up in court because they pass a car that didn’t pass inspection,” Dupont said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5153655-Howard-Pearl-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 05:59:10.259497

The Legislature advanced three statewide ballot measures North Dakota voters will consider in 2026. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers passed three ballot measures during the legislative session that will go to voters in 2026.
If passed by a majority of voters, the state could see a new 60% voter threshold for passage of future constitutional changes; a single-subject rule that limits the scope of future ballot petitions; and adjustments to legislative term limits.
 60% constitutional measure threshold

House Resolution 3003, sponsored by Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, would require approval of 60% of voters to pass constitutional ballot measures. The new threshold would apply to both citizen-initiated petitions and constitutional changes advanced by the Legislature.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, said the state’s constitution should have a different standard than the Century Code.

“The constitution should be harder to amend,” said Roers, chair of the Senate State and Local Government Committee, which held hearings on the ballot measure proposals.
Opponents of the resolution argued that bringing a citizen-initiated measure is not easy and the higher threshold undermines voters’ rights.
The ballot measure will be voted on during the November 2026 general election.
 Single-subject rule

Senate Resolution 4007, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, would require the Secretary of State’s Office to deny any citizen-initiated constitutional ballot petition that is “comprised of more than one subject.”
The single-subject rule would also apply to future constitutional amendments proposed by the Legislature. 
Mary Tintes, vice president of the League of Women Voters of North Dakota, said the organization does not support the ballot measure and has concerns that the language is ambiguous, leaving it open to interpretation.
“We’re just afraid that it’s going to be used as a tool against some of the initiated processes that we are using,” Tintes said.
Lawmakers directed that the single-subject rule ballot measure appear on the June 2026 primary election ballot.
Roers said the Legislature chose the primary so the general election ballot wouldn’t be “overloaded” with ballot measures.
Some opponents of the resolution object to it being placed on the ballot of the June primary, an election that typically sees a lower turnout than the general election. 
 Amending legislative term limits

Senate Resolution 4008, sponsored by Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, would amend North Dakota’s term limits law that was approved by voters in 2022. The law limits lawmakers to serve no more than eight years in each legislative chamber. 
  Sen. Mike Dwyer, R-Bismarck, speaks at a Feb. 12, 2025, legislative hearing. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)
Under the new resolution, lawmakers would be able to serve for up to 16 years in one chamber. It also clarifies that partial terms, such as being appointed by a district executive committee to fill a vacant seat in the Legislature, would not count toward the term limit total.
The resolution would also repeal Section 4 of the term limit law that prohibits the Legislature from amending, repealing or altering the term limits portion of the law, which has raised concerns about a potential lawsuit over the resolution, if it becomes law.
Roers said members of an opposition group, U.S. Term Limits Foundation, testified against the resolution during the committee process and said it could be challenged in court. 
Tintes said the League of Women Voters has not taken a position on the term limits ballot measure, but she thinks voters may be getting annoyed with addressing the same things over and over again.
“It certainly doesn’t require much of a memory to say, ‘Didn’t we already vote on term limits?’” Tintes said. 
The resolution will be voted on during the November 2026 general election.
Citizen-initiated measures
A sponsoring committee for a separate citizen-initiated ballot measure is gathering signatures that would eliminate window tint requirements for North Dakota vehicles. If the committee gathers and has more than 15,582 signatures verified by the Secretary of State’s Office, the measure would be put to the voters in 2026. The committee must submit its signatures by Feb. 24, 2026.
House Bill 1340, signed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong in March, decreased the amount of light required to pass through front vehicle windows from 50% to 35%.
A group of citizens submitted a petition in February for a ballot measure focused on transparency of lawmaker records, legislative salaries and lobbying. It has not been approved for circulation. Secretary of State Michael Howe said his office is waiting for the committee to resolve some issues with sponsoring committee member affidavits.

Local leaders and community members gathered to celebrate breaking ground on the new development, 4401 Rosa Parks Apartments, which will feature 40 one-bedroom and 20 two-bedroom units, according to a news release from the City of Detroit.
Amongst attendees at the building site was Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, the news release said, who remarked that despite slow population growth in Michigan, Detroit has experienced recent population growth. U.S. Census Bureau data this week reflected that Detroit saw positive population growth in the past year for the second year in a row.
“Breaking ground on this beautiful new affordable housing development on the same day the Census Bureau released data showing that Detroit is leading the state in population growth is so meaningful,” Duggan said. “Adding 60 new units of beautiful affordable housing right here in the Woodbridge District demonstrates how as the city continues to grow, we are working together to make sure Detroiters of all incomes can afford to live well, even in some of the hottest neighborhoods.”
Duggan is running as an independent candidate for governor in 2026.

The housing development is a collaboration between nonprofit real estate developer Cinnaire Solutions and Woodbridge Neighborhood Development, a community-based non-profit dedicated to redeveloping the area as an affordable place to live, the release said. Funding comes from public and private sources, including a grant from the Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority and financing from Independent Bank and the Michigan State Housing Development Authority, or MSHDA.
And part of the project will include building commercial space on the ground-floor of the building, as well as a community room, the release said. There will also be a bike share station, a new playground, green gathering spaces and a corner plaza.
Residents in Woodbridge are invested in making the neighborhood a place not only for families to live, but make a life, Executive Director of Woodbridge Neighborhood Development Jai Singletary said in the news release.
“4401 Rosa Parks is the cornerstone of a resident-led plan to preserve affordability, promote connectivity, and protect the neighborhood’s sense of place,” Singletary said. “Bringing new affordable, accessible apartments with modern amenities reflects our commitment to expanding housing options in Woodbridge.”

House Bill 2, a sprawling budget bill working its way through the New Hampshire Legislature, includes under-the-radar provisions that could gut an important state renewable energy program.






The 183-page bill, already approved by the House, includes measures that would redirect millions of dollars from a state renewable energy fund to the general budget and to rebates for utility customers.


Advocates say the changes would endanger renewable energy development in New Hampshire and do not belong in this bill, which is intended to lay out policy changes needed to implement the state budget.


“Major policy changes do not belong buried in a bill with no chance for significant scrutiny,” said Nick Paul, director of legislative affairs for nonprofit advocacy group Clean Energy New Hampshire. ​“It’s undemocratic, and it’s irresponsible.”


Supporters of the measures, however, say they are sensible approaches to saving consumers money at a time when energy bills have been soaring.


“You can’t keep piling costs on the backs of ratepayers indefinitely because eventually they’re going to rebel,” said Rep. Michael Vose, a Republican and the chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee. ​“We’re not against clean energy at all, but we are for cost savings and efficiency.”


The provisions in question relate to the state’s Renewable Energy Fund, which utilities pay into when they are unable to meet state requirements for procuring renewable energy. The fund supports programs including competitive grants for non-residential renewable energy projects, rebates for solar installations, and funding for community solar projects benefiting low- to moderate-income residents.


The pending bill would transfer all of the fund’s uncommitted dollars to the general fund, as the state deals with ongoing budget shortfalls. Then, from 2027 on, most of the money that flows into the renewable energy fund would be returned to residents as a rebate on their electric bill. The fund would only retain enough money to cover administrative costs and the budget of the state’s offshore wind and energy innovation office — a total of $660,000 in fiscal year 2024 — as well as incentive programs at the discretion of the New Hampshire Energy Department.
“It would effectively eliminate the fund,” said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation.
The fund’s annual revenue has ranged from less than $1.4 million to more than $19 million since it was launched in 2007. In 2023, the last year for which numbers are available, the fund took in $5.9 million and disbursed about $4.5 million. The awards included a $140,000 grant expected to cover most of the cost for a solar installation on housing for older adults in Portsmouth, and a $400,000 grant to support a biomass-burning system to provide heat and air conditioning to an assisted-living community.












Projects like these would be at risk if the proposal to return renewable energy fund money to utility customers becomes a reality, Krakoff said. ​“They’re unlikely to be able to make up that money elsewhere,” he said.


Vose acknowledged that the plan for the fund would deprive some proposed projects of access to money, but said tackling high energy bills is more important right now. In addition, the renewable energy market has developed to a point at which it might not need as much support from state incentives anymore, he said.


“A vast majority of the legislative caucus in the House thought it was more important to save ratepayers some money at this particular point in time,” Vose said. ​“It’s time to start rethinking what kind of money we’re spending on these projects.”


The bill is now under consideration in the Senate. Supporters and opponents alike expect the Senate to remove the provision that funnels money out of the renewable energy fund, though that does not mean it will be completely off the table. It is possible the measure could be restored when the two chambers conference to resolve the differences in their versions of the bill, Vose said.


Otherwise, it is probable the idea will return as a standalone bill at the beginning of next year, he said. It would likely be joined by another measure adjusting some of the requirements for renewable energy procurement by utilities and lowering the payments they make into the fund for noncompliance.


That, said Paul, is where these ideas belong: In their own bills, facing public scrutiny, rather than deep within a budget implementation bill.
“I don’t think these are proposals that would pass on their own,” he said. ​“They are deeply unpopular, and they don’t make any sense.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/statehousemedex-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 05:00:56.186048

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector) 
 In partnership with Public Health Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom focused on public health inequities, Kansas Reflector is examining the overlap between housing and health as rates of homelessness continue to rise and access to affordable health care remains out of reach.

PITTSBURG — Stevie and Brandon Perez could not stay awake any longer. They found two chairs in Mercy Hospital’s intensive care unit waiting room, a place they knew would be open, and they drifted off.
Around 1 a.m., a hospital staff member shook them awake: “You guys gotta go.”
It was time to move again, but this time would be the last.
They were serious.
Stevie and Brandon mostly walked around at night. They would stay with friends, sleep in people’s yards or camp in public places, sometimes in the shelter of playground equipment.
“It was,” Stevie said, then paused.  “It was. It was very degrading.”
They were sick and tired of living on the streets. Cold winters. Glares and murmurs from other residents of Pittsburg. Drug addiction. It had become unbearable. It had become life-threatening.
In southeast Kansas, which is home to the highest poverty rates in the state, collaborative solutions tailored to the needs of the community have proven successful in addressing homelessness and in shrinking uninsured rates for people like Stevie and Brandon. These programs act as safety nets for people whom traditional systems leave behind. The Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas is one of those safety nets, expanding the definition of health care to consider every aspect of a person’s life, including housing.
Stevie and Brandon, at the time they were homeless, fell into what health care advocates call the coverage gap, which includes the more than 240,000 Kansans who are uninsured because of unaffordable health insurance. The gap is especially prominent in the 10 states, including Kansas, that haven’t expanded Medicaid to include low-income adults without children or disabilities. 
A parent or caretaker living in a two-person household and making more than $8,100 a year is ineligible for Medicaid in Kansas. The state spends about $10,000 on each of its roughly 427,000 Medicaid patients each year, but as congressional Republican leaders look to cut federal funding for the program, its future here is uncertain, and advocates fear more people could lose coverage.
About one-third of people in the U.S. who have experienced a bout of homelessness in their lifetime relied on Medicaid, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found. 
In Kansas, relying on Medicaid is nearly impossible.
People who experience homelessness, particularly those who don’t stay in a shelter like Stevie and Brandon, often have unmet health needs and are more likely to have chronic diseases, serious mental health challenges or substance use disorders. Without housing or income, health care is often out of reach. That’s especially true when health care for those with housing and income can be unaffordable and inaccessible.
“The stability of the place came first,” Stevie said. “Then we got better physically and mentally.”
Recovering from drug addiction and a persistent pain in her side, which she suspects is from the years of drug use and living outside, only could be addressed once she had a stable place to sleep.
Then came the job, “and then it was like, sky’s the limit,” she said.
 
Housing as health care
Stevie, 43, was born and raised in Pittsburg, a daughter to a well-off family who took a wrong turn, as she describes it. She is a former pageant kid, which remains evident in her bouncy personality and constant smile. Optimism and gratitude are part of almost every breath, even as she confronts the side effects of homelessness, including rebuilding relationships with her three children.
The first time Becky Gray, the executive director of Building Health Inc. in Pittsburg, met Stevie was at a temporary overnight shelter.
“I was walking in and she held the door open for me,” Gray said. “I said, ‘How are you doing?’ ”
“I’m three days sober,” Stevie told her.
“And she hasn’t come back,” Gray said.
Building Health, a subsidiary of the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, was designed specifically with the relationship between housing and health in mind.
“Housing is health care,” Gray said, “and oftentimes homelessness is preceded by poor health.”
Sometimes it causes it.
People experiencing homelessness — particularly those living in cars, encampments or makeshift shelters — are at a higher risk of contracting infectious and noninfectious diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also often face mental illness, alcohol and substance use disorder, diabetes, and heart and lung disease. Homelessness and its side effects shorten a person’s life expectancy by more than 17 years.
Since the 2010 Affordable Care Act authorized Medicaid expansion for low-income adults, experts identified unhoused populations as a group that could benefit from expanded coverage and, in turn, improve public health outcomes. In recent years, the federal government, for the first time, allowed states to use up to 3% of their Medicaid budgets toward specific housing-related services, cementing the link between housing and health. But states have to opt to do so.
Homelessness in Kansas reached its highest number in a decade in 2024, with more than 2,500 people experiencing homelessness on any given night, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Stagnant wages and increasing housing costs have catapulted homelessness numbers in the U.S. since the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Housing and health go hand in hand, according to Becky Gray, the executive director of Building Health, a subsidiary of the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas that seeks to address homelessness with compassion and collaborative solutions. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)
Building Health was formed in 2020 and is just beginning to get off the ground. Gray has a 15-year plan full of meaningful solutions that enable the community to track new housing units and effects on health outcomes in certain areas. With funding from the federal government and a local philanthropic foundation, the project, dubbed “The Station,” will include 10 rental units for people exiting homelessness with supportive services and an adult education center.
“Our homeless program managers are currently designing courses so that when people who are homeless come into our program, we can, in addition to their housing goals, adjust some of their education and employment goals as well,” Gray said.
That includes a model kitchen to prepare people for hospitality jobs and basic courses on how to set up an email account and create a digital calendar. The $4 million project also plans to fund street outreach and access to showers, lockers, laundry machines, telehealth visits and mental health care.
Kansas is at a point, in Gray’s mind, where large-scale change is possible. That’s because statewide organizations have shifted from competition to collaboration, Gray said. Pittsburg is operating as a pilot program, meaning its approach to addressing homelessness is set to be replicated across the state.
 
Everyone matters
Of the more than 443,000 Kansans on Medicaid, 32% of children and 11% of adults live in rural communities, according to the American Hospital Association. Rural areas contain about a third of the state’s population.
Uninsured rates across the state vary, with higher percentages in rural and impoverished areas. The portion of the state’s population without health insurance plateaued at around 8.5%, beginning in 2022. 
Crawford County, where Pittsburg is the largest city with around 20,000 people, has been able to reverse its uninsured rate, despite having one of the highest poverty rates in the state. In 2010, nearly 22% of residents were uninsured. That number shrank to roughly 16% in 2020 and is now around 12%.
The Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas offers care to the region regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. The center is one example among several rural solutions across the state, filling in the coverage gap and turning the tide of generational poverty by fostering healthier communities.
Stevie, a patient at the center, calls it a one-stop shop.
“They’ll go out of their way to make sure you get what you need done,” she said. “They also facilitate everything out there.”
That includes housing help, clothing, transportation, legal assistance and education.
The health center’s headquarters in Pittsburg sit on the grounds of a former hospital run by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who cared for the town’s miners at little to no cost beginning in 1903.
The health center has grown since then into a multimillion-dollar nonprofit receiving grants from the federal government. Its 1,000 employees serve 85,000 patients a year across almost 20 locations in 10 counties in southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. With one foot in the city’s history and another in its future, the health center’s leaders have grappled with how to confront disproportionate levels of poverty and poor health outcomes.
The center’s board of directors realized that only about 30% of a person’s health is affected by what happens in an exam room, said Jason Wesco, president of the health center. Health care providers can’t solve a lifetime of problems in one visit, or even a series of visits, he said.
“I want our providers to feel like they matter and they’re making progress, and often they don’t, because the problems we’re trying to solve have taken 150 years to happen,” he said.
  Jason Wesco, president of the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, walks around the center’s clinic in north Pittsburg, where patients can receive care regardless of their ability to pay. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)
So he began asking questions about how to house people, create infrastructure for transportation and provide food — the other 70% of a patient’s health.
“At the core of all that is a belief that all this matters,” Wesco said, “that there aren’t throwaway communities, and there aren’t throwaway people.”
At the same time, Wesco tries to cut through the politics of the decidedly political issues of homelessness and affordable, accessible health care.
“I think we waste an awful lot of time blaming, and I think that gets left behind,” Wesco said. “And I think rural communities have this really unique opportunity to solve problems quickly.”
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, has proposed Medicaid expansion each of her seven years in office. The Republican-led Legislature has blocked the proposal every year.
Despite the unpopularity of potential federal Medicaid cuts and the popularity of Medicaid expansion among Kansas residents, Republican leaders continue to demonize the program. House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, applauded the prospect of massive federal cuts.
“For years, we have said that expanding Medicaid beyond those who truly need it will jeopardize the program, and now here we are,” Hawkins said in a May 5 press release. “Our country cannot continue spending money like drunken sailors.”
If Kansas lawmakers were to adopt Medicaid expansion, nearly 150,000 adults and children would gain coverage, and the state would have access to an additional $650 million in federal funding each year, according to a 2023 estimate.
 
Watching her blossom
Since December 2023, Stevie and Brandon have been drug-free and off the streets. They married in March 2024, then moved into an apartment two months later with rental help from a charitable organization as they built up their income from working at a local fried chicken restaurant.
Stevie obtained health insurance from the private marketplace with an affordable plan that is tailored to lower-income earners who can’t qualify for Medicaid. After five years of waiting for public housing assistance, Stevie and Brandon now have subsidized rent, which means they can build up their credit, keep their bills paid and look toward the future.
For Stevie, that could mean owning a home or a career change that puts her college degrees to use, she said. In her free time, she volunteers at a local food bank called Wesley House, which once functioned as a homeless shelter where Stevie spent the night.
“The thing is that they’ve all seen me at my lowest,” she said, “and now they’re all seeing me, like, blossoming.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)Ohio medical regulators have a warning for the growing number of retail IV hydration clinics in the state: They’re practicing medicine and pharmacy, and if they don’t follow the rules, they could face severe penalties.
The State Medical Board and the Ohio boards of pharmacy and nursing on Thursday released a joint regulatory statement reminding the businesses that they have to adhere to high standards. 
“Retail IV therapy clinics have proliferated across Ohio, often offering the administration of preselected IV fluid ‘cocktails’ that include a mix of saline, vitamins, prescription drugs, and amino acids,” a press release accompanying the joint statement said. “While these services claim to treat conditions such as dehydration, migraines, and to enhance athletic recovery, the Boards emphasize that such IV therapy is a medical practice requiring licensed professionals and compliance with Ohio laws and regulations.”
There are 201 such clinics in Ohio, according to a spreadsheet from the pharmacy board. They administer intravenous infusions promising to cure hangovers and speed recovery from tough workouts. They also said their IVs deliver vitamins and other compounds that can help improve patients’ complexion, boost immune systems and relieve stress.
“Generally, a patient will walk into the business, review the menu of treatment options, complete a health screening questionnaire, and undergo a precursory evaluation (including pulse oximetry, heart rate, blood pressure, review of medications, and allergies) with an employee who is not a prescriber, usually a registered nurse or a paramedic,” the medical regulators’ joint statement said. “The employee will then recommend an IV cocktail, with or without additives, based on the ‘protocol’ established by a licensed prescriber…” 
The regulatory boards said they’re concerned that personnel in the clinics are doing things for which they’re not licensed.
“The operation of a retail IV therapy clinic involves the practice of medicine, nursing, and pharmacy,” the statement said. “The practice of these professions requires a license and adherence to a scope of practice established by Ohio law.  A license to practice these professions is specific to the licensee and does not generally permit the delegation of their scope of practice to any other unlicensed person except under specific laws and rules.”
The statement cites several specific concerns. One has to do with the cocktails the clinics are running into customers’ veins.
“Compounding may only be performed by a licensed pharmacist or licensed health professional authorized to prescribe drugs,” the statement said. “The preparation of IV cocktails as previously described is considered compounding under Ohio law and the clinic is required to obtain a license as a terminal distributor of dangerous drugs… from the Ohio Board of Pharmacy.”
Similarly, the statement said, “The services provided by retail IV therapy clinics constitute the practice of medicine or osteopathic medicine” and must abide by all the licensure requirements and other regulations pertaining to those fields. Violations can result in fines, license suspensions or revocations, and even criminal charges.
In a related matter, the board of pharmacy last week suspended the distribution licenses of two more wellness clinics and those of two out-of-state suppliers.
It suspended the license of Jenerous Hydration in Dover in part on allegations that it was selling retatrutide, a weight-loss drug that hasn’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It also suspended the license of Brooksville Pharmaceuticals, the Florida-based company that allegedly supplied the compounded drug.
In addition, the pharmacy board suspended the license of Harmony Aesthetics, a spa in Mason, partly on allegations that it had mislabeled a drug meant to ease frown lines. The person in charge there first told inspectors she got the drug from its U.S. distributor, then she admitted she had gotten it at a deep discount through a Facebook group, the report said.
It also suspended the license of CRE8 Pharmacy Group of Coral Springs, Fla., on allegations that it sold compounded drugs to Ohio clinics that contained unapproved components.
The pharmacy board already this year has suspended the licenses of more than a half-dozen spas, largely over their practices regarding high-demand GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. As retail hydration clinics boom, suspensions related to their practices seem likely.

The committee had four hearings on the budget, which Senate lawmakers are currently working on. The Ohio House passed the budget last month and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine must sign the budget by June 30.

Todd Jones, president and general counsel of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio (AICUO), spoke out against provisions the Ohio House added to the budget regarding new requirements for private colleges if they want to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, which gives the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to go to an Ohio college or university.
Under the new changes made in the House, private colleges would also have to accept the top 10% of Ohio’s graduating class and comply with parts of Senate Bill 1 — Ohio’s new higher education law that bans diversity and inclusion efforts and regulates classroom discussion, among other things. 
“I want to be clear that our concerns are not about DEI and SB 1,” Jones said. “Our concerns are about the very nature of our institutions and what it means to be a private, nonprofit institution. … When the state dictates our missions, board structures, curriculum, hiring practices, workloads, and public engagement, the autonomy that defines nonprofit institutions disappears.”
Tiffin University President Lillian Schumacher said the S.B. 1 mandates would increase operational costs without improving educational outcomes.
“For many institutions, these new burdens could lead to closures, reduced financial aid, higher tuition, and a reduction in critical educational services for students,” she said in her testimony.
Forcing private colleges and universities to accept the top 10% of Ohio’s graduating class would create challenges for those institutions, Chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education Mike Duffey said.
“Public universities have the infrastructure with branch campuses, large-scale facilities, and state funding to absorb enrollment increases,” Jones said. “Independent institutions operate on much smaller scales.” 
Eight AICUO institutions function out of a single academic building, he said. 
“Imposing this mandate without providing financial or logistical support places an impractical burden on private colleges,” Jones said.  
Being able to welcome an additional influx of students depends on various factors including the students’ major, housing and financial needs, University of Findlay President Kathy Fell said. 
“I know we all agree that students will not benefit from this opportunity if approbate supports and resources for success are not available,” she said in her testimony. 
Aultman College President Jean Paddock said the 10% acceptance mandate would not be possible in healthcare programs that are limited to a capped number of seats.
“With a nursing shortage well documented, sending our best and brightest who want to enter the healthcare field to other states is the opposite of what we want,” Paddock said in her testimony.
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship. The acceptance rate was 100% in Hocking, Holmes, Putnam, Adams, Monroe, Noble, and Vinton counties, Duffey said.
In the second year of the scholarship, 87% of Ohio students accepted the scholarship and 11 rural counties had a 100% acceptance rate, Duffey said. 
Ohio Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, said she has received several inquiries from private colleges and universities with concerns about the Governor’s Merit Scholarship requirements being linked to compliance with parts of S.B. 1. 
“Clearly we would lose some students if they weren’t able to access those funds,” Duffey said. 
The budget currently allocates $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million for fiscal year 2027 for the Governor’s Merit Scholarship.

(Ron Osborn photo)Montgomery County in southeast Kansas is an isolated place.
Two-lane, often shoulderless, highways lead into the main towns: Independence, Coffeyville, Cherryvale and Caney. With an ever-declining population of 31,448, most rural residents have no access to high-speed internet unless they want to spring for Elon Musk’s Starlink. TV antennas don’t really work. Dish and streaming services offer network TV channels out of Oklahoma and Missouri, further isolating residents from Kansas news.
When Kansas went 57.2 percent for Donald Trump in the 2024 election, Montgomery County residents gave him 74.7 percent of their vote. In the heart of this red bastion, a group of protesters persevere. Who are they, and what do they think they can accomplish?
Carol Sanders, chairwoman of the Montgomery County Democratic Party, plays a major role in organizing the rallies, but the system has a grassroots feel. People just invite people and post Facebook calls to anyone feeling the need to make a statement or find community.
Now 72, Sanders doesn’t have a long history of protests. Her activism started in 2017 when Trump was first elected.
When asked her motivation, Sanders paused before she sighing and launching into a list of issues: abortion, immigration, Ukraine, economics, LGBTQ+ rights, and the separation of church and state.
“Really, I guess what it comes down to is a threat to our democracy,” she said. “What is going on is abhorrent to me.”
Sanders continued: “I was a Republican for years. I voted. I paid attention, to some degree, to the news. I never in a million years thought I would be organizing political protests.”
A retired system analyst for Phillips Petroleum, educated at Kansas State University, Sanders stood in front of Memorial Hall on April 10 in Independence with approximately 35 others. She held a sign saying “Democracy Is At Risk!!” Other signs supported medical research, Ukraine, human rights and denounced DOGE (unfortunately spelled Dodge).
Debbie Dye stood with Sanders on the steps facing the traffic on Highway 75. Some cars honked, making the protesters cheer. Dye’s reasons for braving the 28 mph wind gusts were personal.
“I have three daughters, and one benefited from Kansas University’s Cancer Research,” she said. “Hearing of research cuts for KU broke my heart.”
She also found community: “Being here makes me feel I’m not alone.”
Dye, 74, has six grandchildren from her three daughters and one great-grandchild. Retired after 25 years as a paraprofessional for the Tri-County Education Co-op, she still volunteers as a tutor. Her activism started when her daughters were in local public schools and Dye became involved in reducing class size.
“I went to PTA meetings. I spoke at board meetings, and I saw the system worked,” she said.
Two high-school aged boys walked along the sidewalk through the protesters. One respectfully asked Dye why she was there.
She explained: “My mother had better health care options than my granddaughter. I grew up here and I had such a great life. I want that a for you.”
They thanked her and moved off toward the local Sonic.
Ivory Porter, 42, has attended three of the Montgomery County protests and one Labette County town hall meeting.
“It’s important to stand up and fight back,” she said. “Plus, it lets like-minded people know they are not alone.”
Porter received her Anthropology degree from Kansas State University when she was only 20. She works nearly full-time substitute teaching for area schools.
“I just protest because I know it’s the right thing to do,” she said.
Dale Belcher, a male-minority member of the group, said he had been a Republican most of his voting years. Now 68, the retired music teacher was motivated to march for many of the same reasons that found him serving in the Peace Corps in Jamaica for two years after college. He wants a better world.
“I don’t like controversy,” he said. “I’ve never protested before in my life and I’m basically a conflict avoider.”
So why is he standing with a red, white and blue banner waiting for an approving car honk?
“I’ve done everything right,” Belcher said. “I voted. I worked election jobs, and now I’m really frustrated. For me it’s about respect. … Respect for all people, the economy, immigrants, science.”
None of the protesters appeared to fit Trump’s label of “Radical Left Lunatics,” and none appeared to be “fighting hard to bring Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, the Mentally Insane and well known MS-13 Gang Members and Wife Beaters back into our country,” as a recent Trump social media post warned us.
Turnout fluctuates depending on weather and what community activities lure the faithful away, but Sanders plans more events. So far there have been four protests in Independence and three in Coffeyville. On May 3, protesters gathered at the junction of US 169 and US 166 in Coffeyville . Sanders will call for the first gathering in her home town of Caney (“the reddest town in Montgomery County,” she said) on May 31.
None of the Montgomery County protesters seemed likely to key a Tesla or “conduct an illegal boycott” to make their points. Teslas in Montgomery County are elusive anyway. Even the protesters seemed unsure just how their actions were going to effect change. Still, they hope their stance will residents consider the costs incurred by the current administration.
As Dye summed it up: “I just had to do something.”

Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
Vets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

Jim Pillen for his signature to transform them into state laws. If you’re keeping score at home (Pro tip: You should be.), that’s nearly six times more than the U.S. Congress has sent along to the president to become federal law as of this writing. 
And one of those was a simple continuing resolution, which meant Washington pols couldn’t agree on how to fund the government, so they did some can-kicking down the road towards a place called Do Nothing Congressville. 
Federal lawmakers would do well to emulate the Unicameral’s 2025 output. That said, the measures that landed on Pillen’s desk — despite earning enough votes to arrive there — surely came with a variety of opinions about either their efficacy or their expedience. Some good. Some not so. A couple stinkers.
What they’re doing
Obviously, the governor could veto any of them. Suffice to say, however, that the ideas and principles contained within those 31 were something enough state senators liked.
A drone’s eye view of the proceedings reveal what you might expect: We’re against smut, illicit drugs and thieves, and we’re for interruption-free school days and lowering property taxes.
Some were even legislative slam dunks, passing 49-0. Still others were big vote getters such as LB 383, which requires you to be at least 18 to establish a social media account and prohibits the use of AI to generate pornographic images of minors. We’re also about to codify what many school districts already do: ban cell phones in public schools during the day, and to just say no to sales of lab-grown meat, making sure our cheeseburgers have parents other than petri dishes.
Among the senators’ handiwork was a dead aim at assorted crooks and ne’er do wells who use ATM and gas pump skimmers and their felonious brothers and sisters in the business of shoplifting for profit: stealing and then reselling or fencing the pilfered goods. One bill, LB 230, regulates the sale of tianeptine, known as “gas station heroin,” sold as a dietary supplement but which can be dangerous, even deadly. 
A two-year budget closed a looming deficit for now, and some property tax relief may be on the way, but some other high profile subjects were left in committee or on the legislative chamber floor for lack of votes. Such is a representative form of government.
Devil in details
Senators also found a number of devils in the details of trying to mitigate the will of Nebraska voters by tweaking the minimum wage law, which voters approved at the ballot box. Playing footsie with ways to diminish the wishes of voters never plays well in the Legislature, despite new and creative ways to dress up the idea.
Even LB 89, among the session’s most contentious proposals, the “Stand With Women Act” has — thankfully —moved away from policing bathrooms and locker areas to address only the “fairness” issue through a gender lens in high school and college athletics. That alone is one of modern society’s stickiest wickets, so getting off the toilet and locker snide was a reasonable step for legislators.
Nevertheless, to my knowledge, during the entire discussion and debate of LB 89, little if any evidence was provided that men were regularly using women’s bathrooms in Nebraska … or anyplace else for that matter. While I’ve read of no particularly solid, universal solution to the transgender athletes and competitive sports conundrum, the incessant attention the Legislature has paid to this issue — not uncommon among state legislatures — can work against those in the transgender community as they feel put upon and devalued. 
Finding legislation that addresses these issues without such side effects would be a real legislative triumph. Thinking it can be done is a start.
Finally, if we really want to stand with women, we should do so comprehensively. To their credit, lawmakers did just that when they voted 49-0 for LB 78, which gives housing support to survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking. 
Protecting young women from unfairness on the playing fields or intruders in their private spaces may be one thing, but in a state where, according to the World Population Review, over a third of Nebraska women have experienced domestic abuse, including intimate partner violence, standing with women should include working to reduce that number, too.
The Legislature will still add to the pile on the governor’s desk. To the state’s Congressional delegation and the other 430 elected to do the people’s business: Take note.

State regulators oversee Georgia Power rate cases. John McCosh/Georgia Power (file)Monday is the last day to register to vote in the June 17 primary to fill two Georgia Public Service Commission seats on an embattled board that has faced criticism for a series of Georgia Power rate hikes over the last several years.
Winners of the upcoming primaries will face off in November to determine who will serve on the five-member charged with regulating a number of  telecommunications, electricity and natural gas services across the state. The winners will serve on a board that has approved six utility rate increases since 2023 for Georgia Power customers.
This year’s primary and general elections will mark the first time since 2020 PSC contests have appeared on Georgia ballots following lawsuits challenging redistricting and the fairness of the PSC election process for Black voters. Typically, the terms of the five commission districts are staggered over a six-year period.
The 2025 PSC early voting period for the primary election will be held from May 27 to June 13.
If no candidate receives 50% of the vote in the June 17 election, a runoff election will be held on July 15.
Georgians can find information about registering to vote and more about elections on the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.
Currently, Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are facing challengers seeking to upset their bids to remain on the board. The other three members of the board are also Republicans.
Echols, who is seeking his third term on the PSC, will face challenger Lee Muns in the Republican primary for the commission’s District 2 seat. Whoever wins will go on to face Alicia Johnson of Savannah, the sole candidate for the Democratic Party.
Although the commissioners must reside in the geographical district that they represent, every Georgia voter can determine the winner since the state regulators are elected statewide.
There is a large field of candidates for the metro and suburban Atlanta area represented by Johnson, who is seeking re-election after being appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp to fill a vacancy in 2021.
One of the Democratic candidates is Daniel Blackman, who served as a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden, and went to a run-off against incumbent Lauren “Bubba” McDonald in the 2020 Public Service Commission election.
The District 3 Democratic primary also includes Keisha Waites, a former member of the Atlanta City Council and the Georgia House of Representatives, as well as Peter Hubbard, founder of Center for Energy Solutions who has been an expert witness at PSC hearings, and Robert Jones, who has had a career involved in energy regulation in California.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Friday that a residency challenge has been filed against Blackman after he moved into the PSC district one day before the deadline for candidates.
Since the start of 2023, the average Georgia Power residential customer is paying about $43 more to cover base electric rate increases, recover excess fuel expenses, and cover the cost of completing two nuclear power generators at the Plant Vogtle expansion.
The Southern Company subsidiary serves about 2.7 million customers and is the state’s largest supplier of electricity.
Georgia Power’s 2025 resource plan details the company’s ambitious energy deployment goals for the next decade, including accelerated plans to add both fossil fuel and clean energy sources.
Georgia Power projects that over the next decade the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption. The proliferation of data centers has become a source of consternation for a number of consumer and environmental watchdogs.
There has been some optimism among Republican members of the PSC that the new federal administration under President Donald Trump will curb inflation and stabilize some of the high electricity bills Georgians pay. Additionally, they stated that they supported efforts to increase solar production and usage in the state.
Georgia isn’t the only state with customers frustrated about rising utility costs. Consumer education nonprofit PowerLines and the polling company Ipsos conducted a nationwide survey in March that revealed 73% of 2,000 respondents were concerned about rising energy prices.
“The results held consistent across the political spectrum, with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike expressing similar levels of concern,” the report said.
However, 90% of respondents could not identify the name of the state regulator that oversees gas and electric bills.

Free.,"Conservatives on U.S. House Budget Committee switch votes, advance GOP package",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/conservatives-us-house-budget-committee-switch-votes-advance-gop-package,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on the Budget Committee moved the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation bill a step closer to the chamber floor in a rare Sunday night vote after a handful of conservatives blocked the bill Friday. The massive deal squeaked through on a 17-16 vote, with four far-right panel members voting “present.” They were Reps. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas. All four voted no on the bill Friday.Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania flipped his Friday vote of “no” to support the massive budget reconciliation deal that cuts safety net programs to pay for extending, and expanding, President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law — at a cost of $3.8 trillion over the next decade.Smucker, the panel’s vice chair, switched his vote Friday because of committee procedural rules that allowed him to propose reconsideration of the measure.Brecheen, Clyde, Norman and Roy voted “no” on Friday after demanding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients begin prior to the bill’s stated date of 2029, and that clean energy tax credits phase out at a faster pace.Roy wrote on social media Sunday night that he changed his vote “out of respect for the Republican Conference and the President to move the bill forward” but that the bill “does not yet meet the moment.”Other details on why the members changed their votes to “present” were unclear. When asked by Democrats on the panel whether anything had changed in the bill, Budget Committee Chair Jody Arrington said negotiations were “fluid.”“Deliberations continue at this very moment. They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House,” said Arrington of Texas.Ranking Member Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said his side of the aisle wanted “transparency.”“If the bill has changed and there's been some side agreement reached, I think it's important that all the members have the full details on that in advance of any vote,” Boyle said.Massive billThe committee’s tense Sunday night meeting began nearly 30 minutes late.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters on Capitol Hill shortly beforehand that talks were going “great” and that “minor modifications” had been made over the weekend.The 1,116-page bill package that includes bills from 11 separate committees will now need to clear the House Committee on Rules to advance to a full House vote. House members are set to leave for Memorial Day recess on Thursday.As written, the bill cuts more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health program for low-income individuals as well as those with disabilities.Credit downgradeSunday night’s vote came just two days after Moody’s Ratings downgraded the U.S. government’s credit rating, citing a gloomy outlook for U.S. debt and interest burdens.“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” a Friday statement from the investment rating service read. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”The reconciliation package could add up to $3.3 trillion to the national debt through 2034, reaching $5.2 trillion if temporary provisions are made permanent, according to analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet released scores for all parts of the megabill.The far-right House Freedom Caucus board released a statement shortly after Sunday night’s vote, saying the bill continues to increase deficits “with possible savings years down the road that may never materialize.”“Thanks to discussions over the weekend, the bill will be closer to the budget resolution framework we agreed upon in the House in April, but it fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget,” according to the statement posted on social media.Members of the caucus who do not serve on the Budget Committee made similar public statements.“America faces the reality of financial insolvency and looming bankruptcy. For 9 years, I have remained faithful to principles that include an end to the continuous growth of FedGov deficit spending. I will not support a federal budget that increases federal deficit spending,” GOP Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana wrote on his X profile Sunday.Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee wrote on the social media site, “The Moody’s downgrade is yet another wake up call. We need to decrease spending immediately!”Thin marginsAs expected, and following Friday’s same result, Democrats on the panel voted unanimously against the package.Republicans hold a slim 220-213 margin in the House, meaning that if more than three Republicans vote with Democrats — who are all expected to vote against the package — the bill would fail on the floor.Republicans swiftly voted down several last-ditch efforts by Democrats on the panel to protect low-income health care and food assistance programs, as well as clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.Johnson must also contend with a parallel — and expensive — fight among his conference on the state and local taxes, or SALT, deduction. Republicans who represent high-income, high-tax blue states like California and New York, are demanding a more generous cap on the amount they can deduct.",,,,2025-05-19 01:01:07.420342

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Pennsylvania voters head to the polls on Tuesday for the 2025 primary election. 
In the first election since Donald Trump won back the White House, Democratic voters across Pennsylvania are selecting who they want to be their mayoral candidates in several of the state’s biggest cities. 
After suffering significant defeats in 2024, which included losing a U.S. Senate seat, all three statewide row offices and two congressional districts, the primary races may indicate which direction the Democratic Party will be taking over the next few years.
Most of the state’s largest cities have contested primary elections, with the exception of York, an outlier in this cycle, with only one candidate being on the ballot for mayor. Since most of these cities are Democratic strongholds, the winner of the primary election will likely have an easy path to victory in November. (In Pennsylvania’s closed primary system, only registered Democrats and Republicans can vote in their party’s primaries.)  
Here are a few cities where voters will select nominees for mayor on Tuesday. 
Pittsburgh’s primary 
Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey made history four years ago by defeating incumbent Bill Peduto – becoming the city’s first Black mayor and the first challenger to defeat a sitting mayor since 1933.
Now, he is trying to avoid becoming the second incumbent mayor in a row to lose a re-election bid. 
Gainey faces a strong challenge from Allegheny County Controller Corey O’Connor in tomorrow’s Democratic primary, which will likely determine the next mayor in the heavily blue city. (Pittsburgh hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1934).

O’Connor, a former city councilman and the son of former Mayor Bob O’Connor, has out-raised Gainey, received big support from developers and has been endorsed by the city’s trade unions. He has drawn some heat for accepting support from mega-donors to Donald Trump. 
In ads, O’Connor has targeted Gainey over blight and crime. He’s also gone after the police chief’s sudden decision to retire after public controversy because he was working part-time on the side as NCAA basketball referee. 
“Our city needs stable, dedicated leadership, not revolving door appointments or part-time commitments,” O’Connor told WESA last month. “I will ensure we have a chief who is focused on rebuilding trust, strengthening Pittsburgh’s public safety and delivering real results for our community.”
O’Connor did not respond to requests for comment. 
Gainey supporters have shot back that homicides and nonfatal shootings have dropped due to Gainey’s use of more community-based violence prevention programs. Several prominent African-American groups have accused O’Connor and his allies of using “racist tactics” by focusing heavily on crime in his attacks against the Black mayor. The city is about 22% Black.
They’ve also sparred over development, with O’Connor saying Gainey has slowed housing growth in the city. O’Connor disagrees with Gainey’s push for citywide “inclusionary zoning,” which creates affordable housing requirements for developments in the city, in favor of a more neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach.

Noting developers have supported O’Connor by a margin of 4-to-1, Gainey said attacks on his zoning initiatives are yet another sign that O’Connor is the candidate of the developers. 
“For decades, the rich and developers have ruled things in this city and now with Corey O’Connor, they want to take back that power because I am trying to help poor people,” Gainey told the Capital-Star. 
The conflict between Israel and Palestine has also played a role in the race. In August, Gainey’s communication director, Maria Montaño, resigned after blowback stemming from her signature on a petition calling on the city to avoid firms with ties to Israel. 
Gainey also apologized for “mistakes” in a statement he signed onto on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas that was criticized as “victim blaming” by the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh. 
“We have asked time and time again for (Gainey) to be our ally and to stand up for us — and unfortunately, we have been met with great disappointment,” Jeremy Kazzaz, executive director of the local Beacon Coalition, a pro-Israel Jewish advocacy group, told Jewish Insider earlier this year. 
Allentown
Voters in the state’s third largest city will also cast their ballots to determine if their incumbent mayor will serve a second term. 
Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk and Allentown City Councilmember Ed Zucal are both vying for the Democratic Party nomination. 
Tuerk, seeking a second term, made history in 2021 when he became the first Latino mayor in the city’s history. He writes on his campaign website that he “will continue to bring a fresh voice to City Hall, maintaining a focus on the power of partnerships and building coalitions, not tearing it down and trying to build it back up.”
“Our government will continue to be run effectively and efficiently, serving all of Allentown’s residents and reflecting the incredible diversity of the city,” the site says. 
Zucal, a two-term city council member, says on his campaign website that he’s “tired of seeing our residents get ignored.” 
“It’s time to get back to basics, put residents first, and deliver results for the people of Allentown,” he said. 
Tuerk has a fundraising advantage over Zucal, according to Armchair Lehigh Valley. The incumbent has raised $50,970 from January through May 5, while Zucal raised $21,279 in that same time period. Tuerk’s campaign had $32,981 on hand at the end of the filing period on April 30, while Zucal’s campaign had $31,022.
In 2021, Tuerk, a longtime economic development official, unseated incumbent Mayor Ray O’Connell in the Democratic Party primary by a narrow margin in the six-candidate race for the nomination. He cruised to victory in the general election over Republican Tim Ramos.
Depending on Tuesday’s outcome, it may not be the only time Tuerk and Zucal face off this year. No Republicans have filed to run for mayor, although Zucal is also actively seeking Republican write-in votes, which may pit the two candidates against each other in the general election.

Erie
Erie Mayor Joe Schember, who is seeking a third and final term, is facing two challengers in the Democratic primary.
“Despite the pandemic, despite the societal issues, and despite the financial challenges facing the city, my administration has made significant progress in positioning Erie for a more prosperous future,” Schember writes on his campaign website. “I remain committed to my mission: build opportunity, restore hope, transform Erie. In my first six-plus years, I have remained open, honest, transparent, and accessible, and that will continue as long as I am mayor.”
Daria Devlin, an Erie School Board member, and Sheila Woeger, a retired teacher, are also both hoping to lead the northwest Pennsylvania city. 
Devlin said in a campaign video that it’s “time for change” in Erie.  
“For too long, we’ve been sleeping on our potential as a city, and the time to act is now,” Devlin said. “Working families can’t wait four more years to find affordable housing. Can’t wait for jobs to come back. Can’t wait for the safe streets our kids deserve.”
Woeger told Erie News-Now that her top priority is to “look at the books and go over the budget line-by-line to see how the money is being spent and that it’s going to the appropriate places,” adding she also wants to meet with city employees one-on-one to see what Erie can do better.
According to Erie News-Now, the race is believed to be the first time two mayoral candidates in Erie have raised more than $200,000. Schember raised $203,841 from Jan. 1 to May 5, while Devlin’s campaign has raised $217,840 since launching her candidacy last year.
The Erie County Democratic Party endorsed Devlin over Schember and Woeger.
During his successful 2021 campaign, Schember cruised to victory over Democratic challengers Tom Spagel and Sydney Zimmerman. In 2017, he was first elected to the office after winning a crowded seven candidate race for the Democratic Party nomination. 
The Erie-Times News notes that the winner of the Democratic Party primary will be a “huge favorite” given the party’s registration advantage and that no Republican has been elected mayor since 1961. 
The winner of the Democratic primary will likely face Republican Matthew Thomas, an attorney and sole GOP candidate, in the general election. 
Scranton
The race to lead the Electric City includes several candidates, although just two are featured in the Democratic Party primary: incumbent Mayor Paige Cognetti and Robert Sheridan, a former Scranton School Board member. 
Cognetti is seeking her second full term in office. She was first elected to the office as an independent in 2019 in a seven-candidate special election to fill the seat previously held by Mayor Bill Courtwright, who was sentenced to prison on public corruption charges.
She ran as a Democrat in 2021 and coasted to victory in the primary election over Scranton City Controller John Murray. Cognetti went on to defeat Republican Darwin Lee Shaw II in the general election. 
Prior to winning a school board seat in 2009, Sheridan ran for multiple offices in the past, including the Republican nomination for mayor in 2001, although he lost in the primary election. Sheridan is also the Scranton Democratic Party chairman.
Former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a lifelong Scranton resident, has backed Cognetti’s campaign.
Patricia Beynon, an accounting executive, and Lynn Labrosky, a business owner, are vying for the Republican Party nomination, while Scranton Councilman Gene Barrett is running as an independent.
Bethlehem
William Reynolds, seeking a second term in office, is going up against city Councilwoman Grace Crampsie Smith in the Democratic Party mayoral primary. 
According to Armchair Lehigh Valley, the incumbent has the fundraising edge. Reynolds had $123,379 in total funds from Feb. 1 to May 5, while Crampsie Smith’s campaign had $73,945. Armchair Lehigh Valley has also reported the two “have often clashed on city issues, especially when it comes to creating more affordable housing.”
In 2021, Reynolds, then a Bethlehem City Councilman, won the Democratic party nomination for mayor over former city administrative employee Dana Grubb and later won the general election. In that same year, Crampsie Smith was the top vote getter for the four open seats on Bethlehem City Council, per Armchair Lehigh Valley.
No Republicans have filed for the race, meaning the winner of the Democratic Party primary will likely be elected to the office for the next four years. 
Lancaster
The race for mayor of Lancaster is one of the contests that is an open race after Mayor Danene Sorace announced in July 2024 that she would not seek a third term. 
City Council Vice President Jaime Arroyo and Councilwoman Janet Diaz are seeking the Democratic Party nod, while no Republican challengers have filed for the race.
Arroyo has been endorsed by the Lancaster City Democratic Committee, the Pennsylvania Working Families Party, and Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania PAC, and several local elected officials, including Sorace. Diaz’s campaign website lists endorsements from two Philadelphia City Council members, plus an attorney and a cardiologist in Lancaster.
Harrisburg
The state’s capital also features an incumbent Democrat running for a second term. Wanda Williams, then Harrisburg City Council president, won the Democratic Party nomination in 2021 over incumbent Mayor Eric Papenfuse.
On Tuesday, Williams is facing Harrisburg’s City Treasurer Dan Miller, Harrisburg City Councilman Lamont Jones and community activists Lewis Butts Jr. and Tone Cook Jr. 
PennLive reports that Miller is significantly outraising and outspending the rest of the field. 
There are no Republican candidates that have filed for the primary election. 
  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (via Krasner campaign)
What about Philly?
Cherelle Parker made history in 2023 when she was elected to become Philadelphia’s 100th mayor and the first woman to hold the position. Although Parker isn’t up for reelection until 2027, the state’s largest city will be voting on a few citywide races on Tuesday, including district attorney.
Democratic primary voters will decide between incumbent Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner and former Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Pat Dugan.
Krasner is seeking a third term and has been endorsed by the Working Families Party, Our Revolution, a progressive political organization, U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-2nd District), and several other Philadelphia lawmakers aligned with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. 
Dugan, who is more moderate, has been largely backed by influential building trades labor unions, as well as multiple elected officials, mostly representing Northeast Philadelphia.

For the second election in a row, the Philadelphia Democratic Party decided to not issue an endorsement in the district attorney race, which the Philadelphia Inquirer described as a “snub” for Krasner. Instead, the party is leaving it up to the individual ward leaders to determine who they want to support in their respective wards. 
Both candidates have raised more than most of the mayoral primary candidates across the state, although Dugan has outpaced Krasner since he declared his candidacy. WHYY reports that between November 2024 and May 2025, Dugan raised about $900,700, while Krasner’s campaign raised more than $499,900 during the same time period.
In 2021, Krasner coasted in the Democratic primary, securing a roughly 30 point victory over challenger Carlos Vega. He won by more than 40 points in the general election over Republican candidate Chuck Peruto, to formally secure a second term. 
Running as the progressive outsider, Krasner was first elected in 2017 after winning a seven candidate primary and later defeating Republican Beth Grossman in the general election.
No Republican candidates have filed to run for district attorney. 
While Tuesday’s primary election will likely be decisive, Republicans have started a write-in campaign to nominate Dugan for the general election despite his commitment to not run as a Republican.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-19 04:01:24+00:00,CT Mirror,What fighting antisemitism means to Donald Trump,Robert Helfand,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/what-fighting-antisemitism-means-to-donald-trump/,Trump found “very fine people” among the marchers at Charlottesville who chanted “Jews will not replace us.”,"The Trump Administration says it’s “combating anti-semitism” when it arrests students and threatens universities.
 That rationale might be a flimsy pretext, as opponents claim, but it also reflects something subtle and more dangerous. Trump is stealthily narrowing the definition of “antisemitism,” aligning it with ideas that undermine the position of Jewish Americans.
Trump’s administration does not, after all, condemn all ideologies that vilify Jews.  The “Great Replacement Theory” inspired the murders at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue and elsewhere, yet Trump found “very fine people” among the marchers at Charlottesville who chanted “Jews will not replace us.” JD Vance also sees plots to “replace” the white electorate, and Robert Kennedy, Jr., claimed COVID was “ethnically targeted to attack Caucasians” but spare Ashkenazim.
Nor does Trump oppose every form of religious discrimination.  The creator of the “Muslim Ban” served dinner to Nick Fuentes, who draws a hard line between Judaism and “Western civilization,” and he’s invited “proud Islamophobe” Laura Loomer to the White House.
Where Trump has been consistent is in supporting Jewish territorial claims in Israel/Palestine. In his first term, he overturned a decades-old policy declaring West Bank settlements illegal, and he proposed the immediate annexation of large portions of Palestinian territory. He now questions why Israel “gave” Gaza to its residents,[18] and he appointed an ambassador who believes “Abraham and his heirs” hold “the title deed” to the West Bank.
Supporting these policies is not the same as accepting Jews.  The American Jewish Committee says Germany’s Alternativ für Deutschland party has “a clear record of antisemitism.”  Yet AfD’s support for Israel is “unmatched by any other German … party.” Among other goals, that position serves to sanitize AfD’s Christian nationalism.  Its deputy chair connects Israel’s “efforts to preserve its unique culture and traditions” with her own opposition to multiculturalism in Europe, arguing, “The same should be possible for Germany and any other nation.”  AfD’s co-founder asserts, “When we stand with Israel, we are also defending our way of life.”
Trump’s team promotes AfD because he, too, believes our essential identities derive from connections to homogeneous “nations.” By “nation,” he means a privileged subset of the inhabitants of a political territory: as Vance explained at the Republican convention, a “nation” is not a country or an idea, but “a group of people with a shared history.” That’s why Trump opposes birthright citizenship, and why he can casually propose expelling two million Gazans from the place they were born. For Trump, people naturally belong only where their “nation” resides.
This form of nationalism finds the meaning of Judaism in the political movement for a homeland in the Middle East—as when Trump’s Congressional allies declare that anti-Zionism simply “is” antisemitism. But it exposes Jewish Americans to the same threats we face from more conventional Jew-hatred. It allows Trump to tell us Israel is “your country,” and Benjamin Netanyahu is “your prime minister,” making our status in the U.S. a matter of tolerance, not true belonging.
Worse still, Trump makes that tolerance contingent on adherence to his beliefs. If we don’t support the actions of Jewish nationalists abroad, he says, we can’t be truly Jewish, either.  After Democratic politicians first expressed concerns about Netanyahu’s tactics in Gaza, Trump fumed: “Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion … and they should be ashamed of themselves.”  More recently, Trump said of Sen. Chuck Schumer, “He’s not Jewish anymore.  He’s a Palestinian.”
Linking Jewishness to real estate makes Trump see Palestinians as the antithesis of Jews.  In his eyes, a Jew who fails to share that outlook becomes the monster of traditional antisemitic lore: something perverted from its essential nature.
In these ways, Trump’s politicized definition tells a story about “antisemitism” in which most Jewish Americans (the large majority who support the Democratic Party) are the villains —alien perpetrators of “hate” against the Jewish faith.  
This same upside-down logic is now being used to portray the suppression of campus speech as a blow against religious persecution.   Nobody should fall for it.

Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, as they discuss a budget amendment with aide Pete Ecklund, right, on Sunday, May 18, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)This year’s Permanent Fund dividend will be $1,000, according to a final draft state budget approved Sunday afternoon by six House and Senate negotiators.
The dividend was among the biggest items in a $5.9 billion document that will fund state services from July 1 this year through June 30 next year. 
The draft approved Sunday is scheduled for a final vote as soon as Tuesday in the House and Senate and will advance after that to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who may reduce or eliminate individual line items. He may not increase a line item.
The Legislature’s regular session reaches its constitutional limit on Wednesday.
The latest forecast from the Alaska Department of Revenue expects significantly lower oil and gas revenue over the next year, and lawmakers significantly cut services and programs during the budget drafting process. 
Unlike in previous years, the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend was not a contentious issue for budget negotiators at the end of the legislative session.
Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, said on Sunday that lawmakers had already argued the issue earlier in the session, and even though she unsuccessfully voted for a $1,400 dividend on Sunday, she knew the $1,000 figure would be final.
“From my perspective, I already knew what this number was going to be,” she said.
Compressing the dividend is the state’s precarious budget situation. 
In December, Dunleavy handed lawmakers a budget draft with a $2.1 billion deficit and a $3,900 dividend; the budget will leave the Capitol with a surplus of about $55 million. Legislators expect that surplus will evaporate in the coming months — oil prices are running below the Department of Revenue forecast, and Republican members of Congress are planning to reduce the amount the federal government pays for major programs, including food stamps and disaster relief.
The Senate approved a budget draft with deeper cuts than the final document, but during the compromise process, lawmakers added individual line items preferred by the House, which proposed higher levels of spending and a draw from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s main savings account, to pay for that spending.
The final version of the budget eliminates that draw from savings, except as needed to cover a deficit remaining in the current fiscal year. 
If lawmakers don’t approve the CBR draw, money would be taken from the state investment bank — better known as the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, or AIDEA — and the state’s education trust fund. 
That will put pressure on members of the House’s 19-person Republican minority caucus, who previously voted against drawing from the CBR. Thirty votes are needed in the 40-person House to spend from the CBR.
The final version of the budget includes an additional $13.7 million for child care programs, $5.7 million more for infant early learning programs and 15 new full-time positions to help process public assistance applications. 
The conference committee, in charge of negotiating the compromise budget, also approved a House proposal to increase funding for behavioral health services used by mentally ill homeless people by $13.75 million.
“The Alaska Behavioral Health Association made a strong case that they need that,” said Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and chair of the conference committee.
In future years, the state will try to obtain behavioral health funding through federal Medicaid grants.
A $1 million grant to food banks — proposed by the House — was rejected in the final version of the budget, as was funding for public radio.
There will be no new troopers for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough; the committee voted 4-2 to eliminate a section of the House budget that would have re-established the trooper post in Talkeetna. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, and Johnson voted in favor of the addition.
Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and a vote against the addition, said that the reopened trooper post was suggested by Gov. Mike Dunleavy who withdrew that proposal — and all of his other proposed budget increases — before the conference committee met.
Johnson said the failure to include the troopers, who could be used to curtail the Railbelt drug trade, was “probably one of the bigger disappointments for me in there.”
The final version of the budget also eliminates a paragraph that sought to restrict gender dysphoria treatment, the kind used by transgender Alaskans. That paragraph was inserted by the House in its budget draft, but the Senate didn’t include it.
Conversely, a paragraph limiting abortion care, adopted by the Senate but rejected by the House, was included in the final budget draft. 
That paragraph has been repeatedly challenged in court, and the effect of including it in the budget is a small cut to Medicaid funding. 
Josephson said the result of the two decisions is a return to the status quo — the Legislature has included the anti-abortion language in its budget for years, and the anti-transgender language was new this year.

Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services.The House and Senate were able to pass several non-controversial bills on the second-to-last day of the legislative session, but lawmakers continued negotiating behind closed doors on major budget bills to fund human services, education, transportation and more. Education alone comprises roughly 40% of the general fund budget.
Democratic and Republican legislative leaders hope they can finish their work with a one-day special session before Memorial Day, but that depends on quickly hammering out the most contentious parts of a $66 billion to $67 billion two-year budget that their respective caucuses can support.
That won’t be easy, given the dynamics of a 67-67 House and 34-33 Democratic-Farmer-Labor majority in the Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, said on TPT Almanac on Friday that this has been the most difficult session of the 18 she’s been through in the Legislature.
Still unresolved is whether the state will roll back access to subsidized health insurance for undocumented adults and cut funding to private schools, both of which have staunch advocates and opponents.
Lawmakers must pass a budget by June 30, or the government shuts down. Only Gov. Tim Walz can call a special session, but only lawmakers can adjourn once they’re in a special session.
While lawmakers and staff scrambled behind the scenes Sunday afternoon, lobbyists turned the television outside the Senate chambers to the pro golf championship to pass the time until more bills came to the floor.
The House and Senate both passed the judiciary policy and budget bill (HF2432), which in addition to funding law enforcement and the courts, approves closing the Stillwater correctional facility over four years. Walz and legislative leaders announced Thursday that they agreed to close the more than century-old prison, which came as a surprise to other lawmakers, who nevertheless have broadly supported the decision.
Rep. Josiah Hill, DFL-Stillwater, said the prison looks worse than the one in “The Shawshank Redemption.” He said it has to be closed, but in the least disruptive way for the prison’s more than 550 full-time workers and 1,200 inmates.
“We need to make sure we get this process right,” Hill said on the House floor on Sunday.
Union leaders representing correctional officers blasted the decision to close the facility, saying it was made without their input.
The Senate also approved a House bill (HF1143) by a wide margin that cancels $77.2 million in funding for a passenger rail line between Minneapolis and Duluth to help school districts pay for unemployment benefits for bus drivers, paraprofessionals and other hourly school workers.
The Northern Lights Express, a longtime dream of Duluth residents and transit enthusiasts, is dependent on winning federal grants to cover the majority of the cost. That funding seems unlikely to materialize under the Trump administration while it pursues drastic cuts that will further strain the state’s tight budget.
The bill didn’t cancel all the funding for the rail project, and Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, said she’s holding out hope that it will happen one day.
“Although we are making a substantial cancellation because of this austerity that is being imposed upon the people of Minnesota … the Northern Lights Express project is still alive,” McEwen said on the Senate floor.
The bill, which passed the House on Friday and is expected to be signed by the governor, would give school districts $100 million for unemployment insurance for hourly school workers.
Republicans have pushed to end the entitlement, which was passed in 2023 under Democratic control. School districts have complained the benefits make it harder to recruit staff to work part-time summer jobs, and that the mandate will take away critical resources for classrooms.
The state has been funding the cost so far, having appropriated $135 million in 2023. There’s about $33 million left in the account, only about half of what’s expected to be needed this summer.
The Senate also passed a bill (SF2884) with bipartisan support that increases pension benefits for public employees, including school teachers, firefighters and state patrol officers. If it becomes law, teachers would be eligible to retire at 60 years old with lower early retirement penalties if they have 30 years of service. State patrol retirees will receive a permanent 1.25% annual increase in their benefits to help keep up with the cost of inflation. The police and fire plan also gets a one-time 3% boost. The bill must still pass the House.
The House and Senate have also passed a bill funding housing and homelessness prevention (SF2298) as well as agriculture, broadband and rural development (HF2446).",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrE9lzpWQAAKeSW-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-18 21:59:05.381793

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit and its engineers have reached an agreement to end a three-day strike that entirely stopped rail service on the nation’s busiest commuter rail line, officials announced Sunday.
The deal, which must still be ratified by the union’s members and NJ Transit’s board, comes after a seven-year bargaining standoff that included years of mediation, interventions by two presidential emergency boards, and the first strike to hit the agency in more than 40 years. NJ Transit said service will resume Tuesday.
Details of the tenative agreement remain unknown. Tom Haas, the union’s general chairman at NJ Transit, said it would boost hourly pay for train engineers. Gov. Phil Murphy called the deal “fair and fiscally responsible.”
Though negotiators reached a tentative deal in March that offered wage hikes in line with those accepted by NJ Transit’s 14 other unions, rank-and-file members of the NJ Transit Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen overwhelmingly rejected that agreement.
Engineers argued wage differentials with counterparts at other rail agencies and the lengthy training process for their workers — it takes NJ Transit 20 months to train a locomotive engineer — justified larger wage increases.
Officials at NJ Transit resisted, worrying larger increases would trigger provisions to guarantee similar raises in other unions’ contracts, ballooning the cost of the engineers’ proposal into the hundreds of millions of dollars, costs NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri warned would bankrupt the agency.
In the hours ahead of the Friday’s strike deadline, union negotiators offered concessions on work rules and health benefits that would produce savings for the agency and allow larger raises for engineers without triggering increases for other NJ Transit workers, Haas said Friday.
The impact of the strike on New Jersey’s economy was not immediately clear. NJ Transit’s rail service carries roughly 350,000 riders daily, Kolluri has said, and the agency’s contingency plan for a work stoppage could only handle roughly 20% of that volume, and that at a cost of about $4 million per day.
Negotiations spilled into public acrimony with accusations of bad faith negotiation and mental health issues earlier in May, but the two sides appeared to moderate their tone in the final days before the strike.

 The union has been working under an expired contract since 2019.

Free.,Joe Biden diagnosed with a ‘more aggressive form’ of prostate cancer,Jane Norman,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/joe-biden-diagnosed-more-aggressive-form-prostate-cancer,,"WASHINGTON — Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with “a more aggressive form” of prostate cancer, according to a statement from his office on Sunday.The statement said Biden, 82, last week was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. “On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade group 5) with metastasis to the bone,” the statement said.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” it continued. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”The New York Times had reported on May 12 that a few days earlier, a “small nodule” was discovered on Biden's prostate that required “further evaluation,” according to a spokesman.According to the National Cancer Institute, prostate cancer is slow-growing, the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States and the most common cancer.‘Joe is a fighter’Statements of support immediately began pouring in on Sunday as word spread of the diagnosis.“Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis,” his former vice president and the 2024 Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, said on X. “We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time. Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.”“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” President Donald Trump wrote on social media. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who was the party’s vice presidential candidate after Biden dropped out of the race and  Harris took his place at the top of the ticket, said on X that Biden was “a truly decent man and a friend.”“Gwen and I are praying for President Biden and his family,” he wrote.“I am saddened to hear of President Biden’s cancer diagnosis and am wishing him and his family well as he begins treatment,” Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins wrote on X.Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor who served as Biden’s Transportation secretary after running against Biden, Harris and others in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, said Biden “is a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience.”“Chasten and I are keeping him, and the entire Biden family, in our prayers for strength and healing,” Buttigieg wrote on X.“Joe has been a fighter his whole life. He will prevail. Sending Dr. Jill Biden and their family my absolute support,” Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania posted on X.“This is very sad news. Praying for his recovery,” GOP Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said on X. “We are rooting for President Biden in this fight!” former Florida U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz wrote, reposting Luna’s post.Age a factor in presidential raceBiden’s doctors said he was fit and healthy enough to be president after evaluations in February, 2024.“President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” Dr. Kevin C. O’Connor wrote.But by that summer, Biden’s deteriorating state  — though not connected to the diagnosis disclosed Sunday — would force him out of his reelection bid.Biden dropped out of the race for the presidency on July 21, 2024, creating an unprecedented vacancy atop the Democratic ticket one month before he was scheduled to officially accept his party’s nomination. He endorsed Harris to take his place as the Democratic nominee, and she was nominated by Democrats but lost the election to Trump.Biden’s withdrawal came after a weeks-long pressure campaign from party insiders following a disastrous June 27, 2024, debate performance against GOP candidate Trump and rising criticism that he could not mount a winning campaign against the man he had defeated in 2020. Biden appeared frail and confused at several points during the debate, leading to worries he was no longer up to the task of governing.After leaving the White House on Jan. 20, Biden kept a low profile and did not make public remarks until April 15, when he criticized the current administration for cutting thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration and rebutted those who have questioned the program’s relevance.“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon,” Biden said. “They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing 7,000 employees — 7,000 — out the door in that time, including the most seasoned career officials.”Book publicationIn more recent days, the publication of a book by two political reporters, CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, sparked controversy by its claims that those in Biden’s inner circle worked to keep his cognitive decline from public view.Titled “Original Sin,” the book — based on interviews with what the authors said were more than 200 people, mostly Democratic insiders —  included new details about the presidency, such as Biden apparently failing to recognize movie star George Clooney at a fundraiser in June 2024 in Los Angeles. Biden’s decline was such in 2023 and 2024 that use of a wheelchair was discussed, if he was reelected, the book reported.Just Friday, the White House released audio of an interview of Biden by Department of Justice special counsel Robert Hur who issued a lengthy report concluding that while President Joe Biden “willfully retained” classified materials following his time as vice president, he would not be charged with a crime.Hur wrote in the 388-page February 2024 report that prosecutors considered “that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-18 19:01:09.912353

The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.



The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

Terrell McKinney recalls Nebraska’s rockier relationship with Malcolm X, the rather rough road to getting the Omaha-born human rights leader into the state’s Hall of Fame.
John Ewing Jr., who last week became Omaha’s first elected Black mayor, was a toddler when Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, and what sticks with him is how Nebraskans early on used him largely as a comparison point with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

Standing out to JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike is the slow march toward gaining communitywide buy-in to build up the Malcolm X memorial birth site and nonprofit foundation she now heads. Burned into her mind is a moment 15 years ago when she thought: “Where’s the people? Where are the people who are going to move this thing forward?”
But they and other fans said they’ve seen increased recognition and understanding in their state of what Malcolm X stood for. Buoyed by his rising national prominence, local voices have championed Malcolm X’s journey as one of self-determination, personal reformation and quest to unify Black people — and have successfully advocated for ways to enshrine his name in the state where he was born.
Efforts intensified as the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birthday approached — and is being observed Monday, May 19.
“There’s a shift of the tide,” McKinney said, for the Black empowerment advocate he says is often misunderstood. “People are actually honoring his legacy and respecting it. It’s a show of understanding of who he was and what he means to North Omaha, the city and the world.”
Racial antagonism abandoned
Born Malcolm Little, his family left Omaha after suffering harassment from white supremacists, before Malcolm X was two years old. He evolved from a street hustler who, while in prison, became self-educated and converted to the Nation of Islam. He took the new surname “X” to signify the unknown African surname of his ancestors.
After completing a pilgrimage to Mecca, Malcolm X had a new outlook that abandoned concepts of racial antagonism. He changed his name again and denounced the Nation of Islam, which led to death threats.
At 39 years old, as he was about to give a speech in New York City in 1965, the father of six daughters was shot multiple times at close range by three gunmen identified as members of the Nation of Islam.

McKinney, a lawmaker who represents the North Omaha area where Malcolm X first lived, reflected on the Little family that he said was a target of racism. Malcolm’s father, a minister, was active in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which led to the family’s being harassed. McKinney said the Littles would not have fathomed the recent turn of events in Nebraska.
Shifts
Consider these milestones:
In May 2024, the state inducted Malcolm X as the 27th person and first African American into Nebraska’s Hall of Fame. Some along the way thought he was too controversial for the hall the Legislature created in 1961 to recognize Nebraskans who have made significant contributions to the state and nation.
Indeed, it took three different nominations over nearly two decades, in 2004, 2007 and 2022, before he was selected in 2022 by a governor-appointed commission who considered public testimony. The formal induction came two years later, with a bronze bust in Malcolm X’s image installed in the State Capitol. Due to legislation passed in 1998, no more than one person can be added to the Hall of Fame every five years.


Malcolm X, 100 years celebration

	
Various activities, including a block party and youth poetry contest, helped mark the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birth date.
Bus tour “pilgrimages,” which come with an admission cost, will continue through June 1 to view the slain civil rights leader’s bust in the State Capitol — “the very institution that once ignored him,” says the marketing material. Included are presentations, held in partnership with the Black Studies Department at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, to deepen understanding of his legacy and relevance today.
Also part of the celebration is a May 30 free public screening of “Divisible,” a documentary film focusing on the history and current impacts of redlining in Omaha. The show starts at 7 p.m.
A May 31 Legacy Gala at the Durham Museum has an admission cost.

At the induction, former State Sen. Ernie Chambers quipped about what he saw as a near impossibility: “I never thought in my wildest dream that I would live long enough … to see a white conservative Republican governor in a white ultraconservative state like Nebraska participate in the induction of Malcolm X.”
Also in 2024, the Nebraska Legislature passed a law establishing a “recognition” of Malcolm X every year on his birthday. McKinney had pushed for a state holiday, but that measure stalled. He said financial barriers to designating a paid holiday prompted him to change direction. He called the alternative a “good first step.”
The legislation calls for each May 19, starting this year, to be “set apart for holding suitable exercises in the schools of the state in recognition of the sacrifices of the late Nebraska Hall of Fame inductee El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, Malcolm X and his contributions to the betterment of society.” El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name Malcolm adopted after completing the “Hajj” pilgrimage to Mecca and converting to Sunni Islam.
Museum on the horizon
Also in 2024, the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation officially was awarded a $20 million grant from the state to create a museum devoted to its namesake near 35th and Evans Street, a site where Malcolm X first lived with his family. The funds followed through on legislation, approved the previous year, to build the cultural center supporters foresee as a tourist destination.
Originally, the foundation had requested funding through a competitive process set up to dole out economic development grants to North and South Omaha from the state’s federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The museum was not among recommendations by a consultant, however. Amended legislation led by State Sens. Justin Wayne and McKinney carved out funds for the project.
As planned, the public dollars are set to build the museum, which is an anchor of a broader vision to transform the 17-acre campus that marks Malcolm X’s early childhood home.

Construction has yet to launch, but LeFlore-Ejike says planning is “moving along” with a review ongoing of requests that have been submitted for the master site plan development.
LeFlore-Ejike became executive director of the foundation in 2022, taking over work initiated in 1971 by Rowena Moore.
She said efforts to transform the still largely undeveloped area, which has gardens and a visitors center, has had “ebbs and flows.”
LeFlore-Ejike recalled the moment in 2010. She was a volunteer still in school, and the foundation had a grant for “visioning” work after having just purchased the current visitor’s center, which was the former home of a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation. She recalled disappointment in the lackluster support to continue building momentum.
Now, she said, “We’re finally in a season of harvest.”
Citing LeFlore-Ejike’s work with the foundation, USA Today named her a nominee for its Women of the Year program in 2025. The selection recognizes “heroines” across the country who break barriers, push for change and make communities better.
LeFlore-Ejike hopes Malcolm X supporters are proud that decades of volunteer work “has not been in vain.”

Malcolm X’s 100th birthday observance comes as Ewing also celebrates a historical win in Nebraska’s largest city. In last Tuesday’s election, he soundly defeated three-term Mayor Jean Stothert.
“It all goes to show how far we’ve come as a community when it comes to being inclusive and accepting of leaders in our community,” he said.
Ewing said leaders “come in all shapes and sizes and backgrounds.”
“It’s important they are accepted and know they belong here in Omaha and in Nebraska.”

Until last month, Nick Panicola was working at two environmental nonprofits in northern Michigan.
His jobs at SEEDS Ecology & Education Centers and Crosshatch Center for Art & Ecology ranged from organizing educational events to community composting. That included developing “a food recycling network in the area, which we just launched a few weeks ago.” He held the positions through AmeriCorps.
Then came a stop work order from the Michigan Community Service Commission at the end of April.
AmeriCorps provides paid community service jobs that span a wide range of fields, from disaster recovery to education, generally through temporary, low-paying positions.
In April, the agency placed most of its staff on leave.
The Trump administration also ended around $400 million dollars in funding for AmeriCorps grants. That was a big chunk of the program’s roughly billion-dollar budget, which effectively ended over 32,000 positions.
And almost instantly, those cuts were felt in communities across the country.
In Michigan, more than $15 million in funding was cancelled. That means nearly 700 people across dozens of organizations won’t receive the rest of their stipends, education awards and other benefits, according to the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, or LEO.
The state was expecting a National Civilian Community Corps team to assist with ice storm recovery. But that program was terminated.
Grants were canceled for MI Healthy Climate Corps, an AmeriCorps program that funded positions — like Panicola’s — at local governments and other organizations to further the state’s climate goals.
In northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, the program provided staff members to several organizations, including the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities, the Marquette County Planning Division, and Northern Michigan University.
At the state’s Office of Rural Prosperity, a Climate Corps member worked with rural communities to take advantage of revenue from renewable energy, among other duties, according to Erica Quealy, LEO’s deputy communications director.
In an email to IPR, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote that “Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump is restoring accountability to the entire Executive Branch.”
The AmeriCorps Office of Inspector General’s 2024 audit found that independent auditors found multiple issues but that the agency “took appropriate actions” to address some of the recommendations from the previous year. AmeriCorps didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday afternoon.
The agency has also reported that its environmental programs pay for themselves many times over, with high returns on investment.
At the end of April, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined other states in a lawsuit challenging the cuts as unlawful. A group of community organizations and grant recipients from across the country filed a separate lawsuit earlier this month.
The White House did not address IPR’s questions about how AmeriCorps work should be completed moving forward or the legality of the cuts.
Applications for the third cohort of MI Healthy Climate Corps members were still open on the website of the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, as of Thursday afternoon.
In an email, EGLE spokesperson Jeff Johnston wrote that the initiative supports Michigan’s leading clean energy job growth, “which currently accounts for over 127,000 jobs and is expanding rapidly,” along with areas like public transit and waste reduction.
Johnston said the department was “disappointed” in the Trump administration’s cuts, adding that the department hopes there will be an outcome that allows the program to continue.
In the meantime, those who were told to stop work are waiting — with little information about what’s next and bills to pay.
“I think we all have to figure out how we’re going to make that work in this time period,” said Panicola, who was in the midst of his term with SEEDS and Crosshatch. “And I think for a lot of us, that might just be in exiting the program and finding a full time job, hopefully within the same framework of what we cared about and what we were doing before.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-17-064610-1024x755.png,,,2025-05-18 14:03:14.729390

Attorney General Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of shares of Trump Media the same day that President Donald Trump unveiled bruising new tariffs that caused the stock market to plummet, according to records obtained Wednesday by ProPublica.
Trump Media, which runs the social media platform Truth Social, fell 13% in the following days, before rebounding.
Trump’s “Liberation Day” press conference from the White House Rose Garden unveiling the tariffs came after the market closed on April 2. Bondi’s disclosure forms showing her Trump Media sales say the transactions were made on April 2 but do not disclose whether they occurred before or after the market closed.

Trades by government officials informed by nonpublic information learned through work could violate the law. But cases against government officials are legally challenging, and in recent years judges have largely narrowed what constitutes illegal insider trading.
It’s unclear from the public record whether Bondi as attorney general would have known in advance any nonpublic details about the tariffs Trump was announcing that day. Trump, of course, publicly announced his plans to institute dramatic tariffs during the election campaign. But during the first weeks of his term, the market seemed to assume his campaign promises were bluster.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to questions about the trades.
The disclosure forms do not include the specific amount of stocks sold or their worth but instead provide a rough range. The documents do not say exactly what time she sold the shares or at what price. The company’s stock price closed on April 2 at $18.76 and opened the next morning, after the press conference, at $17.92 before falling more in the days ahead. In addition to selling between $1 million and $5 million worth of Trump Media shares, Bondi’s disclosure form shows she also sold between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of warrants in Trump Media, which typically give a holder the right to purchase the shares.
Bondi’s ownership of Trump Media shares has previously been disclosed. Before she became attorney general, Bondi was a consultant for Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company that merged with Trump Media to take the president’s social media company public.
As part of her ethics agreement, Bondi had pledged to sell her stake of Trump Media within 90 days of her confirmation, a deadline that would have allowed her until early May to sell the shares.
On April 1, Trump Media filed a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission with details about holdings of various top shareholders, including Trump and Bondi. The purpose of the filing is unclear, as is whether it relates to Bondi’s sales the next day. It appeared to reregister for sale shares held by several of the company’s top shareholders.

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)Emily Pike’s mother found out that her 14-year-old daughter had been murdered when she saw photos of garbage bags containing human remains posted on social media.
Police didn’t call Stephanie Dosela; she called them after viewing the photos that had been leaked from the Gila County Sheriff’s Department. Emily, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, had been missing for 18 days after running away from a group home in Mesa.
“A mother should not find out on social media about her daughter’s dismembered body,” Dosela said in a written statement to Arizona state legislators on May 14.
The unthinkable way that Dosela said she found out about her daughter’s murder is emblematic of the poor communication and failures of the individual pieces of the tribal, county and state systems — first, to keep Emily safe, and then to find her after she went missing.

During a Joint Legislative Oversight Committee hearing on May 14, Arizona lawmakers heard from law enforcement officials, leaders of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, Emily’s family and the Arizona Department of Child Safety about the failures of the system and ways to prevent what happened to Emily from happening again. Police, legislators and Emily’s family members alike could be seen quietly sobbing at various points during the nearly three-hour-long hearing.
Emily went missing from the Mesa group home on Jan. 27. Her remains were found near Globe, just outside of the reservation where her family lives, on Feb. 14.
But the systemic deficiencies that led her to disable the alarm on her bedroom window and to run away from the Mesa group home date back years.
In 2023, a 911 call was made from a remote area of the San Carlos reservation near Emily’s home, to report that she had been sexually assaulted. But instead of a San Carlos Apache police officer trained in dealing with sexual assaults, the tribe’s fish and game department responded.
San Carlos Apache Police Chief Elliot Sneezy couldn’t tell legislators specifically why fish and game responded instead of one of his officers, but said that fish and game are the experts in finding people in extremely rural areas of the reservation and that police were “busy” that day.
At that time, Sneezy said, there were only 22 police officers on staff to cover the entire 1.8 million acre reservation.
The family member who Emily accused of assaulting her was arrested, but was soon released without being charged. Emily, meanwhile, was taken into the custody of San Carlos Apache social services for her own safety and sent to the Mesa group home.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs previously told the Arizona Republic that it dropped the sexual assault case due to insufficient evidence, but other agencies disputed that claim.
“My niece was a victim, but yet she was punished and removed from her home,” Emily’s uncle, Allred Pike Jr., told legislators. “That’s how justice failed her. The person that she accused of hurting her got to go home. How is that justice? It’s just backwards.”
Terry Ross, director of tribal social services, told the committee that it’s often difficult to prosecute such cases when family members decide to protect the accused.
“What I experience with our tribe is that all the families will support the perpetrator, and we can’t do anything but to remove the child (for their safety),” Ross said.
After tribal social services removed Emily from her home and sent her to Mesa, more than 100 miles away, she attempted suicide and ran away multiple times.
She was placed in a residential mental health treatment facility for more than a year before being released back to the Mesa group home.
In a statement read by family spokesperson Gail Pechuli, Dosela said that Emily experienced culture shock when she was taken from her rural home near the tiny town of Peridot and placed in Mesa, a city of more than 500,000 people in the Phoenix metropolitan area.
“My Emily was far from home, she was alone and homesick,” Dosela said, adding that she told her grandmother that she missed home-cooked traditional foods like acorn soup and tortillas.

Emily lived on the reservation with her mother and other family members. Her father is currently in prison for an arson-related conviction. In her statement, Dosela said that she suffers from addiction issues and lives in poverty, but said she believed Emily was safe in the group home where she was sent.
Sen. Carine Werner, co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on the Department of Child Safety, said that the group home was not given background information on why Emily was there, something that she said was vital to her caregivers’ understanding of her behavior.
While Emily was living in a facility that is licensed by DCS when she went missing, she was not in the department’s custody — she was in the custody of the tribe, which contracts with the group home for placements. The San Carlos tribe has only one tiny group home on the reservation and must place children in other locations when it’s full.
Because Emily was in the custody of the tribe — a sovereign nation — certain reporting requirements outlined in Arizona law when a child in DCS custody goes missing didn’t apply to her.
Kathryn Ptak, director of the Arizona Department of Child Safety, explained that an amended state law signed last year in response to a surge in runaways from DCS group homes didn’t pertain to Emily because she wasn’t in the DCS system.
The law requires family, friends and the school of the missing child to be contacted within 24 hours of their disappearance to obtain any information about where they might be. It also stipulates that the child’s family and tribe must be contacted by phone and in writing to inform them that the child is missing.
Therein lies one of the major issues identified by numerous people who spoke to the committee: Tribal sovereignty means that the state generally doesn’t have the power to pass laws that control tribes.
DCS has memorandums of understanding with four of Arizona’s tribes, but not currently with San Carlos Apache.
“When a child is living on tribal land and either eligible for enrollment or enrolled in a tribe, the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction,” Ptak said. “The state can’t come in and tell them what to do with their children.”
She added that, because Emily was never in DCS custody, the department didn’t have access to information necessary to contact her family and friends.
Sen. Theresa Hatathlie, a Democrat from Coal Mine Mesa and a member of the Navajo Nation, argued that, no matter their race or tribal affiliation, all missing children should be treated the same.
“Emily Pike was born in the state of Arizona, resided in Arizona all of her life, regardless of what tribe she’s a member of,” Hatathlie said.
The senator added that DCS should not just sit by and refuse to help because of jurisdictional issues.
The group home reported Emily missing to police on Jan. 27, and the tribe was informed the next day. But her tribal case worker did not immediately consider her disappearance an emergency, San Carlos Attorney General Alex Ritchie explained, since she had run away and returned several times before.
San Carlos Apache Social Services didn’t inform Emily’s family that she was missing until she’d been gone for a week.
After Emily’s body was found, the San Carlos Apache tribe called for an investigation into group home licensing, and also agreed to investigate how her sexual assault report was handled.
Several of the speakers on May 14, including Ritchie, recommended that every child who goes missing from a group home be immediately considered missing instead of labeled as a “runaway.”

“Our recommendation is that every child, the moment they’re not accounted for, they are missing,” Ritchie said. “That way the level of scrutiny is heightened. Of course, there will be folks who don’t agree with that, but these are children. They are the most defenseless and the most in need of folks looking out for them.”
But because teens will regularly run away from group homes for the weekend, only to show back up the following Monday, Ptak recommended that reporting requirements be loosened so that group homes wouldn’t be required to report a child missing if they’re told they can’t go somewhere and they leave anyway, especially if caretakers know where they’re headed.
Nearly all of the speakers agreed that better communication between all the entities involved was vital to any attempts to prevent another tragedy like Emily’s death from happening in the future.
Suggestions included better sharing of background information about children in their custody between tribal social services and group homes, that group homes have pertinent information ready to provide to police when they report a child missing and that the tribes enter into agreements with DCS for information sharing about children in the group homes that they license.
Emily’s mother asked that the Gila County Sheriff’s Office look into how it handles the sharing of sensitive information on social media, and that the San Carlos Apache Tribe open a larger group home, with better mental health services, on the reservation.
Sneezy told legislators that group homes that house Native children should be better informed about their cultures, and that law enforcement entities should work on better communication, especially since local law enforcement doesn’t have jurisdiction on tribal land.
“What I’ve heard today is the failure of agencies, our departments, our jurisdictional issues, federal, state, tribal,” Allred Pike said. “We need to stop working in silos. We need to start sharing information. We need to start working together so this won’t happen again.”
The committee plans to host multiple stakeholder meetings in the coming months to figure out workable solutions, with plans to recommend changes in law during the next legislative session in 2026.
“This jurisdictional thing sounds easy but I know it’s not, but I commit, and I’m sure the whole legislature commits to finding solutions to make sure that this never happens again,” said Sen. Hildy Angius, R-Bullhead City.
The Gila County Sheriff’s Office, along with the San Carlos Apache Tribal Police Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the FBI are collaborating in the ongoing investigation into Emily’s murder.
Earlier this week, Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a new law that would create a Turquoise Alert, a new kind of alert that can be issued by the Department of Public Safety when a Native person goes missing. The legislation was introduced before Emily went missing but was renamed “Emily’s Law” after her body was found.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota has about half the number of syphilis cases this year as it did at the same time last year, and about a third as many as the same time in 2022, when the outbreak peaked and the state reported the highest rate in the country.
About 160 cases were reported by the end of last month, according to the state Department of Health. Although that’s an improvement compared to the past few years, the number remains high compared to cases before 2020.
Syphilis is a bacterial infection most often spread through sex that can be cured, but can cause serious health problems without treatment and can be spread from mothers to unborn babies.
How the state, tribes and federal government are working to curb SD’s syphilis epidemic

Syphilis was close to being eradicated in the United States in the 1990s, but cases in South Dakota were increasing in the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Syphilis infections nationwide climbed rapidly in recent years, reaching a 70-year high in 2022, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A majority of cases in South Dakota are among Native Americans. While the highest number of cases so far this year is in Pennington County, where Rapid City is located, the highest rates are in counties that include tribal lands, such as Buffalo, Dewey and Oglala Lakota counties.
There was a time not too many years ago when there were hardly any reported cases, said Meghan Curry O’Connell, chief public health officer at the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board in Rapid City.
“We still have lots of work to do,” she said.
Tribal and state entities have partnered in the last few years to address the situation. Some tribal health care systems send nurses to find and treat patients in the Rapid City area and on reservations. The state Department of Health launched its Wellness on Wheels program last year as well. The program provides a mobile health care unit for rural communities, including STI testing, treatment, education, counseling and referrals to community resources.
Curry O’Connell said the work has had an impact on syphilis cases.
“They’re coming down, but we’re not where they need to be yet,” she said. “We’ll just have to continue working to contain the outbreak, treat people, and get the rates back to where they were.”
The disease can potentially persist for decades if untreated, which can lead to death. During pregnancy, it poses a dangerous risk to the baby; congenital syphilis can cause bone deformities, severe anemia, jaundice, meningitis and even death.
The state had the highest rate of congenital syphilis in the country in 2023 with 54 cases, which was 482.1 cases per 100,000 births. Congenital syphilis cases are below that pace this year but remain higher than 2020, with eight cases reported so far. 
While efforts to address syphilis among adults as a whole have yielded results, efforts to screen pregnant women have been less successful. That’s because some women are not receiving prenatal care, Curry O’Connell said, which means they aren’t getting screened and monitored leading up to birth.
Curry O’Connell said she worries potential cuts to Medicaid by Congress and the Trump administration will worsen access to maternal care in the state, which could affect work to screen and catch syphilis.

The National Institutes of Health’s sweeping cuts of grants that fund scientific research are inflicting pain almost universally across the U.S., including in most states that backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
A KFF Health News analysis underscores that the terminations are sparing no part of the country, politically or geographically. About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.
The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation’s foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska and Texas.
The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump’s executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump’s second term.
Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.
KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.
Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.
Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.
“We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn’t make sense to us.”
NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
Adolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It’s science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don’t think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.
  Harm to HIV, Vaccine Studies 

The NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.
Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation’s public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.
Two National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH’s roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH’s website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.
Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,’” according to NBC News.
For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.
Researchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.
For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network’s funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.
“This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don’t have access to something that men have.”
Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.
“It’s important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.
He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.
They were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That’s when he got the notice from the NIH.
“It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.
Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.
  A Hit to Rural Health 

Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren’t immune to the NIH’s terminations.
Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn’t receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children’s vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.
Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.
“States like Montana don’t get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we’re able to do.”
Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH’s Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.
The NIH’s grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.
  Researchers Can’t ‘Just Do It Again Later’ 

The NIH’s research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant’s money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.
Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.
Kahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.
Rachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.
The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported more than 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that’s more acute in rural communities.
After pushback from the university — the institute’s projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.
Among the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state’s congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers.
“We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.
Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.
Other researchers haven’t had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.
“Even if there are changes in the next administration, we’re looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It’s not as easy as like, ‘OK, we’ll just do it again later.’ It doesn’t really work that way.”
  Methodology 

KFF Health News analyzed National Institutes of Health grant data to determine the states and organizations most affected by the Trump administration’s cuts.
We tallied the number of terminated NIH grants using two sources: a Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants published April 4; and a crowdsourced list maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as of April 8. We focused on the first month of terminations: from Feb. 28 to March 28. We found that 780 awards were terminated in total, with 770 of them going to recipients based in U.S. states and two to recipients in Puerto Rico.
The analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements, which we know happened in at least one instance.
Additional information on the recipients, such as location and business type, came from the USAspending.gov Award Data Archive.
There were 222 U.S. recipients in total. At least 94 of them were public higher education institutions. Forty-one percent of organizations that had NIH grants cut in the first month were in states that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election.
Some recipients, including the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are medical facilities associated with higher education institutions. We classified these as hospitals/medical centers.
We also wanted to see whether the grant cuts affected states across the political spectrum. We generally classified states as blue if Democrats control the state government or Democratic candidates won them in the last three presidential elections, and red if they followed this pattern but for Republicans. Purple states are generally presidential battleground states or those where voters regularly split their support between the two parties: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was also blue.
We found that, of affected U.S. institutions, 96 were in red or purple states and 124 were in blue states.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington residents will soon face heftier fines for littering and higher prices for plastic grocery bags.
A new law signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Saturday toughens the punishment for littering and delays requirements for retailers to offer thicker bags for sale from Jan. 1, 2026 until 2028. 
The Legislature will use the two years to review the state’s reusable bag policies, Ferguson said. Retailers who sell thicker bags before the mandate is in effect will be penalized four cents a bag, under the new law.
“We’re called the Evergreen State and is it really evergreen with all the litter?” said Rep. Mark Klicker, R-Walla Walla, sponsor of House Bill 1293. “Our freeways, our interstates, are just packed with litter, it’s horrible.” 
The state’s low fines could be a reason why “people don’t really care” about littering, Klicker said, noting Oregon has a higher penalty for littering. Washington’s new law raises the penalty from a class three to a class two civil infraction. 
The fine will increase from $103 to $256, which includes all state mandated charges, according to legislative staff. The fine would apply to amounts up to one cubic foot, or roughly the size of a backpack. The new law will take effect in late July.
Over the past five years, the number of Washington State Patrol encounters with suspected litterers decreased from 636 in 2019 to 258 in 2024. Most of those resulted in verbal warnings rather than citations, according to state patrol data.
While the state patrol tallied fewer contacts, the amount of litter has not decreased, Klicker said. He originally wanted a task force to study possible ways to better deal with the problem but that part was removed. 
The Senate added language to delay the date when retail establishments would be required to provide thicker, reusable plastic bags to customers.
“Increasing the thickness of the bag isn’t going to help people keep the bags,” Klicker said. “They’ll throw the bags away anyway, so it creates that much more litter into the landfills.”
In 2020, the state passed a law banning single-use plastic bags and required retail establishments to offer paper bags or thicker, reusable plastic bags for sale to consumers.
Reusable plastic bags are currently sold for eight cents and required to be a thickness of 2.25 mils. One mil is a unit of thickness equal to one-thousandth of an inch. The 2020 law increased the price to 12 cents and the thickness to four mils on Jan. 1 2026. But the Senate delayed the change in thickness by two years.
Retailers who sell reusable plastic bags with a thickness of at least four mils before 2028 will be penalized four cents a bag. Customers will see a total charge of 16 cents for each bag on their receipts.
The four cent penalty will be deposited in the Waste Reduction, Recycling, and Litter Control Account to address the negative impacts of litter which will go away in 2028.
The price for paper bags will remain at eight cents per bag.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0166-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-18 09:00:40.872257

We believe our teachers are the most important component of this system and are essential to the success of our schools and students.We see the increasing demands on the teaching profession locally and throughout the United States. Support from the federal, state and local levels is not keeping pace with ever-increasing demands and does not demonstrate the respect for teachers that their work deserves.As the current presidential administration makes drastic changes to education funding, we need to continue to advocate for and protect our students by allocating funding to the places where it is most effective for student learning. Despite what is happening federally, we still have power at the state and local levels to influence how funding is used.Most decisions about education are made locally by school boards, superintendents and state boards. Our school board has authority over what gets taught (or not), how students are supported and how money is spent with direct input from community members like us. We believe our greatest educational asset is our teachers.READ MORE
Today we ask: Why don’t we pay our teachers more? Is it because we can’t or because we simply don’t? When we do spend on education, is it on things that actually benefit student learning? Are we just telling our teachers we value them or using our resources to show them? How can we as community members influence change in these areas?As community members and parents, we want our tax dollars spent first and foremost on helping our children learn and ensuring that skilled teachers are attracted to and remain in the Rutland City School District.Today we ask the board for better pay for our teachers, a salary reflective of who they are as educated, highly trained and dedicated professionals.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov. John Rodgers: Building opportunities for our youth and businesses.","This commentary is by John Rodgers. He is the lieutenant governor of Vermont and continues to operate the family farm, his 35-year-old masonry business, his excavating business and a plowing business.Being a lifelong tradesman — stone mason and excavator, specifically — and now lieutenant governor, I feel obligated to utilize the resources of my office to encourage young (and disillusioned mid-career) Vermonters to embrace the opportunities available to them through the trades so that they may, too, experience success and fulfillment. At the same time, I know the state, as a whole, has an opportunity to collaborate with businesses to expand apprenticeships. A net positive for both working Vermonters and Vermont business. It’s a mission I am embracing with the help of my friends Christine Frost at Courtland Construction and Lisa Durocher at the Northwest Career and Technical Center. I invite you to join us.Vermont’s infrastructure — our roads, bridges, water systems, and stormwater control — is the backbone of our communities and economy. As our state struggles with aging public infrastructure, the need for timely repair, replacement and innovation has never been more urgent — to make no mention of the shortage of housing. Yet behind the shovels and backhoes is a crisis: the shrinking pipeline of skilled workers able to operate heavy equipment. The work of building and maintaining infrastructure is no longer just brute force labor — it’s technical, creative and increasingly reliant on sophisticated technologies. GPS-enabled machines, digital tablets, wireless communication tools and precision controls are now standard on modern heavy equipment. Today’s equipment operators need to be tech-savvy, safety-minded problem-solvers with strong communication skills and spatial awareness. This reality creates a promising opportunity for high school students, especially digital natives who already thrive in technology-rich environments. Careers in heavy civil industries can offer excellent pay, long-term stability and the satisfaction of building lasting public works. Yet, despite these benefits, students are rarely exposed to this pathway early enough to pursue it. Career and Technical Education centers have a crucial role to play. These programs provide hands-on experience, industry-aligned training and a direct pipeline to jobs that are vital to our economy. In Vermont, CTE’s effectiveness is undeniable.As of June 2024, 64.9% of CTE students graduated with an industry-recognized credential, and 46% earned college credit — up from about 20% a few years ago. These gains highlight the system’s adaptability and responsiveness, largely due to support from federal initiatives like the Perkins V grant. However, the limitations are real and growing. The high cost of launching heavy equipment programs, from acquiring machinery to building simulation labs, places a major strain on already limited budgets.Meanwhile, recruiting instructors who bring real-world experience into the classroom is an uphill battle. Industry professionals earn significantly more in the private sector than CTE centers can offer. Without these qualified instructors, we lose the bridge between students and meaningful career opportunities. This workforce shortage isn’t a distant threat, it’s a present-day reality. Without sustained investment in CTE infrastructure, staffing, and programming, we are not only failing our students, we are also jeopardizing our future infrastructure.Communities depend on people who know how to safely and efficiently operate the machines that build our roads, lay our sewer lines, build and renovate our homes, and maintain our bridges. If we don’t act now, we risk an even greater shortage in the years to come. The solution is within reach. Strategic public investment, industry partnerships and creative solutions to recruiting educators and acquiring training equipment can make a powerful difference. With the right support, we can build the workforce we need to meet the current and future infrastructure demands.When you grow up milking cows, banging nails and running — and fixing — equipment, your formative years on a Vermont farm are where you receive your CTE. And while the Vermont of today is different from that of my youth, there will always be a need for the Vermont work ethic and “get-er done” spirit. Our young people deserve the opportunities I had, and our businesses and communities need our young people. Please join us in investing in our state and young people by supporting career and technical education.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov.

Tom Lee, Tampa Bay Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez, and lobbyist Ron Pierce at the Tampa Tiger Bay Club in Ybor City on May 16, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida voters amended the state Constitution subjecting legislators to eight-year term limits more than three decades ago. But as this year’s legislative session continues with no end in sight, the issue of whether term-limits are working for all Floridians was the topic of debate at the Tampa Tiger Bay Club on Friday afternoon.
“I’ve seen a lot happen,” said Tampa Bay area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, the longest-serving member of the Legislature, who was first elected to the House in 2008. “The downside is the experts become the staff, and to some extent, the lobbyists, and to a larger extent, not so much the legislator … so I think it has its drawbacks.”
“Term limits have completely empowered lobbyists,” agreed Ron Pierce, a lobbyist himself who worked for eight years as a legislative staffer and has headed RSA Consulting Group since 2009.
The term-limit law became an issue earlier this year when Brevard County House Republican Debbie Mayfield filed to run for the Senate seat in which she had served from 2016-2024.
After she was term-limited from running again last fall, she instead ran and won a seat in the Florida House. But after the newly elected senator in District 19, Randy Fine, quit to run for and win a seat in Congress, Mayfield filed to run for that Senate seat again in a special election.
The Florida Division of Elections ruled that she couldn’t run again for the seat because of the term limit law. She challenged that ruling, and the Florida Supreme Court ruled for her unanimously in February, stating that her gap in serving in the Senate from November until February allowed her to run again for the Senate seat in a special election (which is slated to take place on June 10).
Concurrent to that drama, Hernando County Republican Blaise Ingoglia filed a resolution during the session (SJR 536) that would have clarified that the law imposes a lifetime limit of 16 years in state legislative office — 8 years max in the House, 8 years max in the Senate — with a caveat for senators who serve reduced two-year terms due to redistricting.
The measure would have gone to the voters as a constitutional amendment in 2026, but stalled after being approved in one committee stop.
“Let’s stop the practice of people continually running for the same office and bouncing back and forth between chambers,” Ingoglia said on X. “Serving the people of Florida should be a privilege, and an honor, not a career.”
Voter-imposed
The “Eight is Enough” constitutional amendment in 1992, which passed with 77% of the vote, did not just include eight-year term limits for the state Legislature, but also for members of Congress, former Hillsborough County Republican state Sen. Tom Lee noted on Friday.
“That was the primary motivation behind it, and term limits for Congress was ultimately ruled to be unconstitutional,” he noted.
Former Tampa Democratic Sen. Janet Cruz, who served in the Legislature for more than a decade before losing a bid for re-election to the Senate in 2022, asked the panelists whether term limits even matter anymore because of “gerrymandered districts.”
Pierce insisted they absolutely do matter, citing the fact that when Rouson does leave the Senate next year because of term limits, his successor will not be nearly as experienced or have the same amount of influence.
“It has been around forever and isn’t going away,” Lee said regarding the issue of gerrymandering.
He added that the way that Republicans gained more seats in the Legislature starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s was because they built a coalition with Black and Hispanic Democrats to carve out seats “to ensure their election in minority-access districts in exchange for the rest of the map looking very Republican. And before you knew it, you had a Republican-dominated Legislature. That’s what happened.”
‘Who’s going to pay for that?’
Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez, a Democrat, served in the Florida House from 1998 until 2006, when he was term-limited from his seat. He said he could make the argument that the state would be better off if term-limits could be extended to 12 or even 16 years, but it would be “controversial” for any lawmaker to push for that proposal.
“There have been efforts to try increase term limits to a different number. I don’t know what that sweet spot is — 12 years, 16 years. None of those have gone very far within the state Legislature,” Henriquez said.
Pierce said he could support getting rid of term limits outright, but added that there’s no way that could possibly happen, since it would require getting them repealed via a constitutional amendment.
“You’ve changed some things in Tallahassee this year, I think, that made it a little more difficult for citizen’s initiatives in the future, that’s number one,” he said, referring to the legislation signed by Gov. DeSantis that will make the process more difficult to get a measure on the ballot.
The second problem, he said, is that it would look “self-serving” for lawmakers to push the measure. But he added that the biggest hurdle would be finding anyone to educate the public about why term-limits should be repealed. “Who in the world is going to try to educate the public on why you’re trying to change term-limits?” he asked. “Who’s going to pay for that?”
The discussion took place just days after Gov. Ron DeSantis travelled to Ohio to give his support for a resolution in that state’s Legislature to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot calling for a constitutional convention to impose congressional term limits. The Florida Legislature passed a resolution last year calling for a U.S. Term Limits convention.

The post 71 years later, Massachusetts must deliver on the promise of Brown vs. Board of Education  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN MY Complexities of Urban Schooling class at Clark University, I have spent the last five years teaching future educators about the challenges and opportunities of US public schools, past and present.  The course is at the intersection of education, history, geography, political science, and sociology, using a mix of primary source historical documents, research studies, policy briefs, documentaries, and even TED Talks to frame our discussions and the student-led solutions to some of the most pressing challenges. A favorite TED Talk of mine in this class is one by Kandice Sumner, a fellow Massachusetts educator. Sumner grew up in Boston and was enrolled in METCO, a voluntary school integration program that sends Boston and Springfield students to suburban schools. In the TED Talk, Sumner discusses how her own METCO experience informed her approach as a teacher in Boston schools, and how, even with that integration program, many of her students faced the same segregated classrooms that she escaped. “Teaching my kids about desegregation, the Little Rock Nine, the Civil Rights Movement,” she says in the TED Talk, ”is a real awkward moment in my classroom, when I have to hear the voice of a child ask, ‘If schools were desegregated in 1954, how come there are no white kids here?’’” I can always count on an audible reaction from my students to that moment in her talk. And that jaw dropping line sums up so much about where we stand today—71 years to the week after the Supreme Court famously declared, in Brown vs. Board of Education, that “in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.”  While talk of school segregation from that period often conjures images of the American South, we know too well from Boston’s ignoble history that the stain of school segregation was present in communities throughout the country.  The bad news is that 71 years after Brown — and 50 years after the beginning of Boston busing — Massachusetts schools remain deeply segregated by race and class. The good news is that together, we can transform our schools and classrooms into the dynamic, diverse, and well-resourced learning spaces that our kids and communities deserve. I began my own teaching career about 20 years ago at the Edwards Middle School in Charlestown, the school that Boston’s former acting mayor, Kim Janey, was bused to in the 1970s.  That chapter of our story is only part of the unique and storied history of the fight in Massachusetts for excellent and equitable schools for all kids. While it has been 71 years since Brown, we actually mark 170 years in Massachusetts this year since the legal abolition of segregated schools, in 1855, the result of lawsuits and public protest led by Black families in Boston. In an 1848 letter from the first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, Horace Mann lays out the most lofty and aspirational goals for our then fledgling school system. “Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin,” he wrote, “is the great equalizer of the conditions of men — the balance-wheel of the social machinery.” Today we continue to strive toward Mann’s vision and Brown’s promise, schools that are the bedrock of community, opportunity, and the future we want for our children. The imperative is not only a matter of economic and racial equity, but of our shared democratic future. As the Supreme Court majority asserted of this integrated and equitable education in the Brown decision, “It is the very foundation of good citizenship.” Indeed, studies suggest that integrated schools prepare students to engage in democratic processes and increase civic participation. Despite that critical need, more than 225,000 students attend racially segregated non-white schools in the state, and Massachusetts public schools are among the most racially and economically segregated in the country.  According to data from The Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University, Massachusetts public schools are the sixth most segregated by income in the country, and only New Jersey has higher levels of economic segregation between school districts.  Students of color are disproportionately hurt by these trends: the average Black or Hispanic student’s school serves almost 30 percentage points more students experiencing poverty than the average white student’s school. The consequences are real, and visible in graduation rates, student disengagement, and college matriculation. We know it doesn’t need to be this way. In fact, we know that most of us here in Massachusetts don’t want it to be this way.  Two years ago, Brown’s Promise, a national nonprofit, was launched to combat school segregation in the US. This week, the first state chapter of Brown’s Promise is opening here in Massachusetts – a place with a rich history, both for better and worse, in the fight to ensure quality education for all. Our mission is to turn the vision of integrated, fully funded schools into a reality for all students, regardless of background.  My colleagues at Brown’s Promise have already been talking to many people in community gatherings across the state, and the results are clear. Families, educators, students, and advocates across Massachusetts agree that every child deserves the same opportunity to thrive regardless of race, income, or zip code.  In recent Springfield, Holyoke, and Lynn community engagement sessions, participants consistently expressed interest in understanding and addressing how segregation, district lines, and funding policies undermine educational quality. We will continue those community conversations and work with partners to analyze policy options to figure out what changes make the most sense in Massachusetts. We know that every community is different and will require different approaches. To help guide this work, Brown’s Promise has outlined five policy solutions already: Fund public schools fully and fairly Rethink school district lines  Ensure integration within districts  Center positive student experiences Cultivate a supportive policy ecosystem I am excited to work with policy leaders, students, and educators to make these things concrete in Massachusetts, and am learning already from the conversations that have already happened in communities across the Commonwealth. For example, families and students in early conversations have been particularly interested in the creation of a series of regional, themed magnet schools that enroll students across district lines without any admissions tests, with free transportation, and with a lottery that ensures socioeconomic diversity.  Massachusetts ranked No. 1 on the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, leading the nation in public education outcomes, but those of us on the ground in our communities know that this does not tell the whole story.  I saw firsthand as a youth worker years ago in Boston, Lowell, Holyoke, and Worcester the ways in which that top-ranked education is out of reach for many of our students of color and/or low-income students. We know that together we can build schools for every child to thrive. Together, we can add our own chapter to the storied history of Massachusetts’ educational leadership for all.  Today, as a parent of a Worcester Public School student and a longtime educator, I am excited to continue these conversations in cities and towns across the Commonwealth to build a shared vision of equitable and excellent schools for all of our kids. Together, we can deliver on Brown’s promise, and ensure that our kids get the integrated and equitable schools that every kid deserves.  Cara Berg Powers is Massachusetts state director for Brown’s Promise, a nonprofit organization advocating for integrated, well-resourced public schools.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-18 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Federal action again moves the Mississippi Legislature closer to the racial demographics of the state,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/18/federal-action-again-moves-the-mississippi-legislature-closer-to-the-racial-demographics-of-the-state/,"Column: The slow, steady increase in Black Mississippians being elected to public office is the direct result of actions of the federal government, not the state. With the latest federal court ruling, this is our state's reality once again.","The slow, steady increase in Black Mississippians being elected to public office is the direct result of actions of the federal government — the executive, legislative and most importantly the judiciary — and not because of actions of the state.
State officials have fought almost every effort of federal officials to expand voting rights for people of color and to increase the number of Black Mississippians holding public office. In the 1800s, the white political leadership crafted a state constitution, rooted in white supremacy and designed to block Black Mississippians from having or obtaining political power. Those Jim Crow efforts, well documented over the years, ranged from poll taxes to literacy tests and more. In the 1960s, laws were passed in Mississippi allowing potential voters to be disqualified based on their “character.”
Those efforts have continued to the modern day with efforts of white leaders to gerrymander political districts to weaken the political influence of Black Mississippians. And sometimes, those efforts have included reluctance and even outright refusal of white power brokers to remove some of those Jim Crow provisions.
The latest response from the federal courts to these continued decisions by the state’s white leaders is a recent ruling that forces the creation of three more Black-majority legislative seats: two in the Senate and one in the House.
As a result of that ruling, later this year candidates in 14 legislative districts (five in the House and nine in the Senate) will have to run in special elections.
Creating the three new Black-majority districts required the redrawing of multiple districts — 14 in this case — around the areas where the new districts were created.
It should not be a surprise that most if not all of those lawmakers are not happy that they are being forced to run for reelection in the middle of their four-year term. But this reality is the result of the Mississippi House and Senate leaders approving a redistricting plan that the federal courts found did not provide adequate representation for Black Mississippians.
The requirement forcing legislators to run in special elections is not unprecedented. In 1991, the Legislature passed a redistricting plan that was supposedly based on population shifts found in the 1990 Census. But the U.S. Department of Justice claimed, and the federal courts agreed, that the redistricting plan did not create enough Black-majority districts based on the population of the state.
After considerable legal maneuvering, the House and Senate created a legislative redistricting plan that the federal courts found did not dilute Black voter strength.
The federal courts ordered that all 174 House and Senate members run in a special election in 1992 under those newly drawn, racially fairer districts only a year after they had won election to a new four-year term. Many legislators were not happy about that.
To make matters worse in the mind of those lawmakers, they were having to run a year after passing over the veto of then-Gov. Kirk Fordice a 1-cent increase in the sales tax on retail items. Fordice promised to campaign in the special election against the lawmakers who approved the sales tax increase.
There is little evidence that Fordice was successful in defeating lawmakers because of the tax increase.
But the special election did result in a significant increase in Black representation in the Mississippi Legislature. As a result of that special election, the number of Black members of the 52-member Mississippi Senate increased from four to 10 and increased from 20 to 31 in the 122-member Mississippi House.
Those numbers have slowly but steadily increased since then because of the nature of population shifts and, yes, because of additional federal court actions.
The Black population of Mississippi is currently about 38%, and the Black voting-age population is a little less than that.
Even with these three new Black-majority districts approved recently by the federal courts, there will be 43 Black-majority districts in the House, making up just 35% of the membership in the 122-member chamber. On the other side of the Capitol, there are 16 Black-majority districts, comprising about 31% of the 52-member Senate.
Thanks to action of the federal government — and certainly not the state — the Mississippi Legislature continues to inch closer to a representation that looks like the demographics of Mississippi. But it’s still not there.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06174816/AP_21239459273852-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-18 07:59:45.564471

The project would have created between 16 and 20 rental units in the community’s century-old town hall while retaining space for town offices.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Let’s get back to work’: Greensboro grapples with vote against affordable housing project.","Two days before Greensboro voted on a contentious proposal to redevelop the town hall into affordable housing, longtime resident and brand-new selectboard member Judy Carpenter wrote a post on Front Porch Forum.“Residents and friends of Greensboro, the big decision is coming,” she said. “No, I don’t mean Tuesday’s vote on the future of the Town Hall. I mean what we all do as community members after that vote.”The housing project saw more than a year of passionate debate, spanning meetings — some organized by the town and others organized by community members themselves — a petition, yard signs, letters, a community website, numerous information sheets and a myriad of internet postings.In the end, residents delivered a clear message, voting 227 to 147 against signing a purchase and sale agreement with non-profit Northeast Kingdom housing agency RuralEdge. However, the small community, which has the highest rate of second home ownership in the state, is left with a dire shortage of housing as well as a divided community.“Greensboro has survived contentious changes in the past—can we do it again?” Carpenter wrote. “No matter what the outcome of this vote is, we have many community projects in need of our efforts. Let’s get back to work.”READ MORE
“You never know until you have an election”The seeds of the town hall redevelopment project were planted around 2019, when both the town plan and a housing needs assessment detailed Greensboro’s “great need” for moderately-priced housing, especially for local employees. According to town documents, the planning commission’s housing committee began a relationship with RuralEdge around that time to develop housing, but had trouble finding a feasible site.In 2022, local non-profit WonderArts decided not to pursue renovating the town hall — a former high school — due to the expense. Town officials turned to the possibility of redeveloping their town hall into rental housing.RuralEdge is proposing to build 20 apartment units at the Greensboro town hall. The units would be spread between the upper floors of the current building and an addition attached to the back of the building. Schematic design courtesy of the Town of Greensboro. RuralEdge Executive Director Patrick Shattuck made an initial presentation of the project at the 2023 Greensboro Town Meeting, and the town signed an option agreement with Rural Edge in May 2023. Somewhere along the way, the project gained opposition, which grew louder and louder.Had the plan been approved, Rural Edge would have bought the building from the town for $500,000 and created between 16 and 20 affordable one- to three-bedroom apartments split between the current town hall and an addition at the back of the structure. The current town offices would have been rented back to the town at operating cost and the Giving Closet, a free community donation space, would have been maintained in perpetuity in approximately half the space.Shattuck said the town hall redevelopment would have been a really impactful project.“One thing that struck me is just the amount of need in Greensboro for housing and people’s willingness to share their personal stories of really being unhoused and the struggles that caused,” he said. “And these are folks who work in the businesses that are so imperative to Greensboro being Greensboro.”Schematic design courtesy of the Town of Greensboro. Shattuck expressed regret that the need won’t be addressed with a project that would have added a significant number of housing units.“It’s sad and frustrating, but you don’t want to force something when it isn’t necessarily the right time and place,” Shattuck said. “Hopefully some of these folks who voiced their concerns, you know, it will mobilize them to continue to work for the change they want to see in their community.”Kent Hansen, current chair of the Greensboro planning commission and a member of the housing subcommittee back when things began in 2019, said last week he was surprised by the outcome of the vote.“I thought that the vote would be closer,” he said. “But you never know until you have an election.”According to Hansen, there were several distinct complaints about the project. One was the scale: A number of people would have felt more comfortable with 8 or 10 units. Another group, he said, thought the town should be holding on to the building and fixing it up for community use.And a third group, he said, was upset with the process, feeling like the selectboard didn’t build up community consensus before signing the initial option agreement with RuralEdge in May 2023.David Kelley, a selectboard member at that time, disagreed with that characterization, stating in an email that there were “plenty of meetings and opportunities to learn” about the project before the option agreement was signed. However, he pointed to another complaint: that the concept of affordable housing “is not fully embraced by significant and influential segments of many communities.”One other struggle the selectboard faced? Rampant misinformation.On Wednesday night, at the first selectboard meeting since the vote, Ellen Celnik — a current selectboard member and an original member of the housing subcommittee — spoke up. She was happy there was a vote and happy the town made a decision, she said.“The one thing that I am truly saddened by is an anonymous mailer that was sent to voters that had an enormous amount of misinformation,” Celnik said. “A part of me, who has worked on this since 2019, really was disappointed with the level of divisiveness that was put out there that was coming from other sources … I hate seeing a small town being hoodwinked by a very small group of people.”At the meeting, the board noted a need to think long-term about the town hall, what it’s used for, and where the money is going to come from to make it useful; the building needs major repairs and the third floor is currently not usable.READ MORE
“It is going to take education, communication and stronger leadership”Looking ahead, Hansen said the planning commission has received a $25,000 municipal planning grant from the state, which they applied for before the vote. The grant aims to help Greensboro build consensus on where they want to grow geographically and what types of housing structures townspeople support.The process is slated to include major public outreach and meetings, an expansion of a survey and several community conversations the commission conducted this past winter. Hansen expects the work to be completed around September.“Hopefully people can pull together,” he said.In the meantime, other smaller housing projects and initiatives are in the works. For one, Shattuck said the very same morning he heard about the results of the vote, he signed a check to fund an accessory dwelling unit in Greensboro. Local businesses have encouraged such units, and a panel discussion about them held last fall in neighboring Craftsbury is thought to have generated at least six such dwellings.The Greensboro Initiative, associated with Central Vermont Habitat for Humanity and whose steering committee is chaired by Hansen, is in the process of constructing a new duplex in Greensboro Bend. The proceeds from the sale of those homes are planned to be reinvested in constructing additional affordable homes.One major local employer, Jasper Hill Farm, continues to take matters into its own hands. Mateo Kehler, co-founder of the artisan cheesemaking business and an outspoken proponent of the town hall redevelopment project, wrote in an email that Japer Hill currently provides housing for employees in eight houses.Kehler said the business recently purchased an additional six housing units (currently occupied by inherited tenants) to support their team, and is in the process of subdividing and selling another house to one of its key employees. Following the vote, he said Jasper Hill is reassessing its ambitions for future growth, particularly in Greensboro.“To make sure our efforts have the most impact, we will be shifting our direct support and investments towards surrounding towns that are more aligned with our mission,” Kehler wrote.Kehler said Jasper Hill also plans to continue its focus on housing by engaging local organizations, including Let’s Build Homes, a pro-housing coalition (Kehler serves on its board), and the Headwaters Community Trust, a community land trust serving Greensboro and three neighboring towns — both of which were launched this year.Kelley, when looking back on the rejected project, noted that Greensboro’s struggle to create affordable housing is not unique. The problem is accelerating across Vermont and the country, he said — and the anger that has fueled recent national and local elections is not going to solve it.“It is going to take education, communication and stronger leadership,” he wrote. “And as a member of our Select Board, I think we failed on those accounts.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Let’s get back to work’: Greensboro grapples with vote against affordable housing project.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Greensboro-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-18 06:59:05.147097

Photo courtesy Lake Champlain Maritime MuseumNoah Diedrich is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.Those large yellow buoys floating atop Lake Champlain aren’t for monitoring the weather, nor are they for decoration. Instead, they mark the final resting places of centuries-old ships that wrecked on the lakebed.The floats are part of the Underwater Preservation Program, a 40-year-old initiative run by the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum that aims to uphold the federal Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987. The act looks to prevent historic wrecks from being disturbed by treasure hunters and salvagers. The museum oversees shipwrecks on Vermont’s side of the lake. “This preserve system is one of the very first in the nation,” said Chris Sabick, the museum’s executive director. “It really is a mechanism for the state to achieve its mandated goals of preservation and access to shipwreck sites.”Vermont’s system, implemented in 1982, has been a model that other states have replicated, Sabick said. The old ways of locating shipwrecks were hazardous to the wrecks themselves — a method the museum wants to avoid.“They would drag their anchor along until it snagged on something, and then they would dive down and see what that was,” Sabick said. “If that happened to be a shipwreck, it might take a piece of the shipwreck with it when you recovered the anchor or when the wind started blowing and pulled the shipwreck apart.”The current system provides a much less invasive technique. The yellow buoys mark the wrecks’ locations, and divers can follow buoys’ lines down to submerged signage identifying each wreck and providing pointers on how to observe without impacting the sites. The wrecks range from steamships to schooners, with most dating back to the early 1800s. A popular wreck is the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry, which is exactly what it sounds like — a horse-powered ferry that sank around 1814. The preserve program, now in its 40th year, is looking to expand access to the shipwrecks for non-divers, Sabick said. One such addition is taking visitors to wreck sites by boat and using remote-operated vehicles to transmit a live feed of the wreck to a TV screen on deck. The museum also created composite 3D models of the wrecks from digital images taken of the sites, which can be viewed on its website from anywhere with an internet connection. A still image from a 3D model of the General Butler, a wrecked schooner in the lake. Photo courtesy Lake Champlain Maritime Museum“It’s just broadening the access to these sites, even for people that aren’t local or aren’t divers,” Sabick said. H.494, a capital bonds bill, would allot $46,000 to the Underwater Preserves Program, an annual appropriation that goes toward site inspections and maintenance. The yearly sum increased from $36,000 in the past few years as the program added two new shipwreck sites. The bill has already passed through the Vermont House and now sits in the Senate. A committee of conference reported on Tuesday that it is recommending the upper house withdraw its recommended amendment .The proposed changes do not affect the allotment to the preserves program. Laura Trieschmann, state historic preservation officer, said the museum has been a tremendous partner that brings life to the wrecks. “They’re not just manning the wrecks with buoys and getting the permits,” she said. “They’re researching the stories of these places so that they’re not just a pile of wood on the bottom of the lake.”About 600 divers visit the wrecks each year, which contributes greatly to the continuation of the preservation program, Trieschmann said. “They’re not going to be around forever,” she said, “(considering) the nature of where they are and mussels and things like that could damage them, as well as boats. We definitely want to showcase them while we can.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lake Champlain shipwreck program to expand access to non-divers.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/diver-shipwreck-lake-champlain-e-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-18 06:59:05.147097

The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.













Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project





During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
 Restorative justice models

In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
 Calls for a cultural shift on expectations

While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.













Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.





Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

Her tenure encompassed President Donald Trump’s first term, a time when staff still addressed the “full range of complaints”  — from racial and gender discrimination to schools denying services to students with disabilities.

But to Simons, the Justice Department’s recent dismissal of a school desegregation order in Louisiana — at a time when racial and socioeconomic isolation continues — is a sign that the current administration has turned its back on students who don’t receive an equal education. It’s why she left the Educational Opportunities Section at the DOJ after 14 years  in April.
“The administration has been very clear that resources are going to be allocated to certain identified priorities,” she said — primarily keeping trans students out of women’s sports and punishing universities it accuses of tolerating anti-semitism. But that agenda, she said, “is leaving a lot of parents and kids with nowhere to turn.”
Now she aims to be part of a solution. She’s lending her expertise to a new initiative intended to give families another way to resolve their concerns — the Public Education Defense Fund.
The National Center for Youth Law, a 50-year-old nonprofit, launched the project on Friday to help families with complaints that the DOJ or the Office for Civil Rights at the Education Department either won’t acknowledge or no longer has the capacity to investigate. Simons will co-chair the fund’s advisory council.
Announced in advance of Saturday’s 71st anniversary of the Brown v. Board decision ending segregation, the effort will include a fellowship program for former OCR attorneys who lost their positions when the Trump administration gutted the agency and closed seven regional offices in March. The goal is to capitalize on the “brain drain” caused by the elimination of nearly 250 OCR staffers and connect families with pro-bono attorneys who can conduct investigations and bring lawsuits to resolve their concerns.
“I have zero confidence in [the department’s] ability to administer the system effectively,” said Johnathan Smith, chief of staff and general counsel at the center. “I think most parents who are looking at what’s happening probably would reach the same conclusion.”

Thousands of Student Civil Rights Cases Left Adrift After Trump Guts Ed Dept

 




As it shifts attention away from discrimination against LGBTQ students and racial minorities, OCR has left thousands of complaints untouched and dismissed many others. Trump’s 2026 budget proposal calls for an additional 35% cut to the office as the administration pushes to eliminate the department.
The center, along with parents and special education advocates, sued the department over the firings, and asked the District of Columbia federal court to immediately reinstate staff. A hearing is set for May 20.
Andy Artz was a supervising attorney in OCR’s New York City office until March 11, when the department placed him and hundreds of other department staffers on leave and locked them out of their computer systems. He was in the middle of helping a student who had been denied access to a senior trip because of multiple disabilities and close to reaching a resolution for a victim of sexual assault by a classmate.
“I found the work really meaningful,” said Artz, who hopes to work with the fund. “OCR was able to do a great job helping school districts and universities understand their obligations.”
To the new administration, however, OCR perpetuated discrimination by focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion and harmed women by extending Title IX protections to transgender students.
“Let me be clear: it is a new day in America,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said when the department announced an investigation into a gender-neutral bathroom in Denver schools. “Under President Trump, OCR will not tolerate discrimination of any kind.”
Even if the court blocks the job cuts, it’s unclear whether attorneys would be allowed to return to cases that don’t align with the administration’s priorities. Smith still sees a need for the new project.
His team will work with local NAACP chapters, bar associations and other community organizations to get the word out about the OCR alternative, Smith said.
In addition to seeking attorneys who will represent students pro-bono, the fund hopes to attract some of the talent forced to leave the federal government by offering four- to six-month fellowships. Attorneys will receive a $12,500 stipend and non-attorneys will receive $9,000. Depending on funding, Smith expects up to 10 fellows in the first round.

 ‘Top-performing personnel’

When Trump was inaugurated, OCR had over 12,000 open cases, according to its website. But the database hasn’t been updated since before the new administration took over. According to Julie Hartman, a department spokeswoman, OCR continues to “evaluate all legitimate complaints” and has initiated over 200 disability-related investigations and dozens related to Title IX and anti-discrimination laws.
“OCR’s staff is composed of top-performing personnel with years of experience enforcing federal civil rights laws who work vigorously to protect all Americans’ civil rights,” she said.
She declined to comment on the fund specifically, but said the department “welcomes support from — and has often worked with — outside groups who want to advocate for students and families and help those who believe that their civil rights have been violated.”
Factoring in staff reductions and those who left voluntarily, Artz estimates that only about a third of OCR’s staff remains out of the over 560 attorneys, supervisors and other employees who worked there last fall.

As Trump Shakes Up Oversight of Special Ed, Frustrated DC Parents Want Change

 




As a former deputy assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, Smith doesn’t solely blame Trump for OCR being “terribly backlogged.”
“It was a system that often was a black hole for families,” he said. “What does it mean to have an Office for Civil Rights that’s actually responsive to families and to young people?”
For Callie Oettinger, a Fairfax County, Virginia, parent and special education advocate, getting OCR to act has yielded mixed results. She has seen complaints linger for years as well as recent steps by the new administration to act on disability cases.
OCR still hasn’t completed a probe into her 2019 complaint that the Fairfax district denied transportation to students with disabilities who needed extra time to complete the PSAT. At the same time, she’s noticed an uptick in OCR investigations on more recent issues. Since early April, officials have responded to two complaints she’s involved in, one filed in December and another in March.
“It’s not clear why they’re starting where they’re starting,” she said. “Things are definitely moving forward, but they’re not doing themselves a favor by keeping their website so outdated.”

Others are looking elsewhere for relief.
In Delaware’s Cape Henlopen School District, Louise Michaud Ngido, an English language teacher, said she’s heard nothing about her complaint that schools have failed to provide English learners with adequate support. Students new to the country, she said, don’t receive specific English development classes and staff members don’t provide translation services or interpreters for parents. The district denied any discrimination.
Under Cardona, OCR opened an investigation last October, but Ngido has heard nothing since. She said she hopes Delaware will be “more proactive” and investigate complaints that OCR won’t.
 Department of Justice priorities

At least one Republican proposal to eliminate the education department would shift OCR’s workload to the DOJ. But the education staff there has always been a fraction of the size of OCR’s. Simon’s former office once had 40 attorneys. Now, she said, it has six.
The agency’s priorities have also changed.
In an interview with the Epoch Times, a conservative media outlet, Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights, said her agenda includes doing “some law enforcement” against hospitals conducting gender-affirming surgeries, elevating parental rights and dismissing school district consent decrees over desegregation.
The DOJ said in a press release that it ended its “probing federal oversight” of integration efforts in Louisiana’s Plaquemines Parish schools because the district was spending “precious local resources” to meet past administration’s demands for data on issues such as hiring and discipline.
In the interview, Dhillon said the department wants to “let people off the hook” if they corrected past discrimination. Consent decrees, in which a district pays a court-appointed monitor for ongoing oversight, are “a powerful tool” and appropriate when there’s been severe corruption or racism, she said. “What’s not appropriate is to maintain these rent-seeking financial arrangements …  beyond their normal life cycle.”
But Simons, the former DOJ section chief, said Black students are still disciplined at higher rates than their white peers and are more likely to attend “crumbling” schools. Research shows that racial and socioeconomic isolation has steadily increased since the 1980s.
“Segregation persists; inequality persists,” she said.
Working with universities to collect and preserve existing data is another one of the fund’s goals. The administration, Smith said, might point to a declining number of OCR complaints as evidence of fewer problems in schools, when, in fact, it’s a byproduct of fewer investigations.
“We want to be able to counter that narrative by showing that just because people aren’t going to OCR doesn’t mean that there aren’t real concerns and real issues of discrimination in our schools,” he said.

 ‘The aid of legal counsel’

Jackie Wernz, a civil rights attorney and consultant who worked at the department during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said it’s important for nonprofits like the center to “step up,” but cautioned that outside efforts have limitations.
“Without a robust federal civil rights arm, civil rights in this country are not going to be enforced,” she said.
States don’t have the same expertise and resources, she said, and it’s unclear who would enforce any changes.
But Smith countered that the bulk of what OCR investigators do is negotiate solutions between families and district staff.
“Having parents and children do that with the aid of legal counsel,” he said, “will yield far better results and outcomes than if they try to navigate those systems on their own.”

Reproductive health advocates are sounding the alarm over the case of a pregnant woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead months ago but must now stay on life support, according to her family, because of the state’s strict abortion ban law.
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse from the metro Atlanta area, experienced a medical emergency in February that involved blood clots in her brain. Smith, who was about nine weeks pregnant at the time, was declared legally dead, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station 11Alive Action News.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Newkirk said that staff at Emory University’s network of hospitals told her they cannot remove the devices that are helping Smith to breathe because of the state’s six-week abortion ban. The staff said they are legally required to keep Smith breathing until the fetus reaches viability, Newkirk added.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk told the television station of Smith, who also has a 5-year-old son. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.”
The case puts a spotlight on the consequences of restrictive abortion bans following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal constitutional right to an abortion. Georgia’s abortion ban has an exception for a pregnancy that threatens the life of the pregnant person. But Smith’s case doesn’t fall under those exceptions, her family said. Since Smith is brain-dead, the pregnancy no longer poses a risk to her life. And because Smith’s fetus still has a heartbeat, the family said that she must still be kept on life support to comply with Georgia’s abortion ban.
Rep. Nikema Williams, an Atlanta-area Democrat, said in a statement Friday that Smith and her family “deserve better.”
“Everyone deserves the freedom to decide what’s best for their families, futures, and lives. Instead, anti-abortion politicians like Donald Trump and Governor Brian Kemp are forcing people through unimaginable pain,” Williams said. “Adriana’s story is gut-wrenching. It’s also a painful reminder of the consequences when politicians refuse to trust us to make our own medical decisions.”

Smith initially sought medical treatment in February for intense headaches, according to her mother. She went to Northside Hospital, where she was given medication and sent home. The following day, at her home, her boyfriend found her gasping for air. Representatives for Northside Hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Smith was then seen by and sent to different doctors throughout the Emory University hospital system, including Emory University Hospital, where she worked as a nurse. A CT scan showed blood clots in her brain. She was subsequently declared brain-dead, which means she is considered legally dead.
Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Newkirk said the hospital staff told her they plan to keep her daughter breathing until she is at least 32 weeks pregnant.
Representatives for Emory told the Associated Press that the hospital network could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules but said in a statement: “Emory Healthcare uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia’s abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.”
Despite historic indictment, doctors will keep mailing abortion pills across state lines

Alicia Stallworth, director of Georgia campaigns for the reproductive rights advocacy group Reproductive Freedom for All, called Smith’s condition “a devastating tragedy.”
“But what makes it even more unconscionable is that her family has been denied the space and dignity to grieve,” said Stallworth. “Instead of being allowed to say goodbye, they are being forced to endure an agonizing limbo because of the state’s extreme abortion ban. This is not care. This is not justice. It is a cruelty rooted in a system that refuses to see Black women as fully human, even in death.”
Newkirk told 11Alive Action News, Georgia’s NBC affiliate, that the state’s strict abortion laws have robbed her family of the choice about whether to continue Smith’s pregnancy and the ability to make decisions on their own terms. They’re now left in limbo and facing the prospect of paying for several more weeks of expensive medical care.
“I think every woman should have the right to make their own decision,” Newkirk told the station. “And if not, then their partner or their parents.”
Smith’s fetus also has fluid on his brain, Newkirk said, carrying unknown implications for his health and future.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said.
“This decision should’ve been left to us. Now we’re left wondering what kind of life he’ll have — and we’re going to be the ones raising him,” she said.
Members of the House Reproductive Freedom Caucus, co-chaired by Democratic Reps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, said in a Friday statement that “there is no desensitizing to the horror of this moment.”
“Adriana’s mother spent Mother’s Day watching her daughter undergo unconscionable medical torture by orders of the state,” they said. “Her young son spent Mother’s Day thinking his mom was just asleep and will soon wake up to hold him again. There are no words that can provide clarity or comfort. There is only the promise that we will say her name until her family sees peace and justice.”
Black women face higher maternal mortality rates in the United States and in Georgia, a public health crisis that has been underscored by the loss of federal abortion rights.
Smith’s case is the latest instance in which Georgia’s six-week abortion ban and its impacts on Black women have made national news. In 2024, the investigative newsroom ProPublica reported on the cases of two other Black women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died of infections after seeking to end their pregnancies in the state. The state’s maternal mortality review committee determined that both deaths were preventable, the outlet reported.
Monica Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong, an Atlanta-based reproductive justice organization focused on women of color, is also the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the state’s six-week abortion ban. In a statement Wednesday, she noted that Smith, a registered nurse, knew how to advocate for herself and navigate the medical system. Still, she didn’t get the treatment she needed until it was too late. Black women, she said, “must be trusted when it comes to our health care decisions.”
“We’ve sounded the alarm for years,” Simpson said. “Yet, after the devastating and preventable deaths of multiple Black women, the message still rings clear: our lives are on the line, and our human right to bodily autonomy has been violated. Our bodies are not battlegrounds for political power plays.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-18 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"One skirmish over the CT budget is over, but the big battle looms",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/18/ct-budget-battle-looms/,Last week's deal among Gov. Ned Lamont and Democrats solved one problem but sets the stage for budget battles that could continue for years.,"At first glance, last week’s budget brinkmanship between Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly’s Democratic majority was over a mundane issue.
When would Connecticut take $300 million out of its $6.5 billion pile of unused cash to make mandatory Medicaid payments to clinics, social service agencies and other providers that treat the poor?
But beneath this procedural conflict was a much bigger battle over the budget controls that helped generate the state’s $4.1 billion rainy day fund — accumulated largely since Lamont took office in 2019 — and the $2.4 billion surplus projected for this fiscal year.
Lawmakers used loopholes for years to avoid a showdown with the fiscally moderate governor and to spend billions outside of a cap system many complain saves excessively to the detriment of education, health care and other core services.
But the chief loophole, nearly $3 billion in emergency federal COVID grants that could be spent regardless of cap limits, has largely been exhausted. 
And as other workarounds also become problematic, Democrats now refuse to constrain programs — at least not while an eight-year explosion of government reserves continues.
Lamont ended last week’s standoff late Thursday, agreeing to the first exception in 18 years to a spending cap that limits most budget growth to increases in household income or inflation. That will allow lawmakers to authorize $300 million next week for Medicaid payments, even though that action will push this fiscal year’s $26 billion budget marginally over the cap by at least $25 million. 
Had the governor not made this concession, providers were expecting that state payments owed in late May would be pushed back until after July 1, a delay some said would make them unable to cover payroll.
More importantly, the spending cap exception will open the door for Democrats and Lamont to compromise on a new two-year state budget, because roughly $300 million extra also will be appropriated to support the next budget cycle.
But with the governor and minority Republicans still championing these budget controls and many Democrats insisting the extra funding —  though helpful — won’t reverse years of fiscal neglect, last week’s struggle could be the first of several for years to come. The budget controls, which last were set in 2017, are largely fixed by law and contract until July 2028, but still can be adjusted with the governor’s consent.
Ritter: No new budget ‘If you don’t solve this Medicaid puzzle’
“If you don’t solve this Medicaid puzzle,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a mid-morning press conference last Thursday, “I don’t know how it all gets paid for.”
The speaker was referring not just to the latest payments owed providers who treat Connecticut’s poor but to planned investments over the next two years in K-12 education, public colleges and universities, municipal aid, social services, nursing homes and other health care programs.
At first glance, Connecticut has the resources it needs to handle all these challenges.
The state has amassed close to $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017, which represent 8% or more of the General Fund. The $2.4 billion cushion projected for this year represents 10%.
Lawmakers have used these post-2017 windfalls to build what was a tiny $212 million emergency reserve — barely larger than 1% of the budget — to a record-setting $4.1 billion, and to pay down more than $8.5 billion of the massive pension debt Connecticut incurred between 1939 and 2010. The state still owes more than $35 billion. And the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think-tank, last year ranked Connecticut’s per capita pension debt highest in the nation.
Critics, including some Democrats in the legislature, nonetheless say the state has overcompensated for its past poor savings habits, stashing cash too aggressively and weakening services for one generation to fix a debt problem created by three.
A spending cap exception of $300 million cannot offset the billions siphoned out of programs and into reserves and pensions over the last seven years, they add.
“We cannot continue to excuse the sufferings of our communities in order to irresponsibly manage our long-term liabilities,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a progressive coalition of faith, labor and other civic groups. 
Critics of the savings programs cite many shortfalls:

Connecticut hasn’t broadly adjusted Medicaid rates for doctors who treat low-income patients since 2007. A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states.


The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an advertising campaign this spring attacking Lamont for allowing the state’s overreliance on property taxes to worsen even as Connecticut’s coffers swell. Communities lose more than $400 million annually because statutory education grants — general aid, special education and funds for charter and magnet schools — haven’t kept pace with inflation, CCM says.


Nonprofit agencies serving clients with intellectual disabilities or struggling with mental illness say state payments effectively are down 30% since 2007 because they haven’t kept pace with inflation, costing providers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. “The safety net is ripping, whether people want to admit it or not,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance.


And the state’s largest health care workers union recently set a May 27 strike deadline for about 6,400 caregivers at dozens of nursing and group homes, saying members can earn more serving fast food than they can assisting elderly residents and clients with disabilities.

“Every day there’s something more,” Ritter said, adding that a more comprehensive debate over budget controls is unavoidable in the coming years.
Lamont, GOP still expect Democrats to make hard choices
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the administration will continue working with legislators, but “the governor’s position has been clear throughout this process: the budget … must adhere to all constitutional and statutory requirements.”
Spending more than the cap permits this fiscal year means legislative leaders must secure not just bare majorities but 60% votes of approval in the House and Senate.
That comes with some political risk to Lamont, who must declare a state budget emergency before the limit can be surpassed — and who has not announced whether he will run for a third term next year.
State officials have legally exceeded the spending cap seven times since it was created in 1991 but not since 2007. That’s when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature, with GOP support, appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But after a severe recession pushed state finances deep into the red and triggered a historic $1.8 billion-plus tax hike in 2011, legally exceeding the cap became politically taboo.
Given the political sensitivity that surrounds the cap, the Lamont administration also has pushed Democrats to be more frugal. But it hasn’t always been successful.
Public colleges and universities’ budgets currently are propped up with roughly $270 million in federal pandemic grants that expire next fiscal year. The Democrat-controlled Appropriations Committee recommended a $55.7 billion two-year budget this spring that replaces much of that vanishing aid with state dollars.
But the Lamont administration notes that public colleges and universities have amassed more than $1 billion in reserves in recent years and should be required to spend some of that massive cushion down before getting more help from the Capitol.
House Republicans note that both the Appropriations Committee and Lamont failed to budget about $230 million requested by the comptroller’s office to cover contractually obligated health benefits for retired state workers over the next two fiscal years combined.
“I think we need to be honest about where we are and where we’re going,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
Connecticut will be hard-pressed to continue prioritizing paying down pension debt if it allows spending to grow quickly as it did for decades prior to 2017, he said.
The House GOP leader added that this past week’s Medicaid billing fight was unnecessary. Democratic legislators and Lamont ignored projections one year ago that showed Medicaid costs were surging, opting not to budget more or trim coverage levels to offset the anticipated demand.
House Republicans also say Connecticut could save tens of millions of dollars annually by ending Medicaid coverage for undocumented adults and children, an idea that Democrats consistently have rejected.
Lamont, GOP also struggle to stay under spending cap
But Democrats counter that Lamont and the GOP have their own struggles when it comes to budget controls.
Lamont, who called the cap “sacrosanct” during a January meeting with state business leaders, needed several gimmicks to keep the two-year spending plan he proposed in February under the limit.
Besides underfunding health care for retired state workers, Lamont also proposed paying for the $60 million-per-year Town Aid Road municipal grant with borrowing, which is spending-cap exempt, rather than including it in the budget. Towns can use TAR funds for capital projects, but many also use them to pay for winter snow plowing — a service not normally financed over many years with interest costs.
And after pledging to bolster Connecticut’s flagging child care industry, the governor recommended creating a $300 million fund outside of the budget and spending cap rules to support new investments in this area for many years to come.
House Republicans recommended a similar shift off-budget to back child care in the biennial plan they proposed earlier this month, while the Senate GOP declined to propose any state budget in this cap-constrained environment.
Democrats add they’ve taken great care to respect Lamont’s top fiscal priorities throughout his tenure, sometimes at the expense of public services.
The governor opposes raising taxes on wealthy households to finance greater state spending or tax relief for the poor or middle class, a position many of his fellow Democrats don’t share. And while the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee has endorsed some wealth-redistribution tax measures during Lamont’s tenure, legislative leaders haven’t included any in the budgets sent to the governor’s desk.

Usage spikes, not just rates, drive costs up. Eversource encourages energy-saving habits—like adjusting thermostats, using appliances off-peak, and switching to LEDs—to stay cool while managing expenses. Efficiency pro[...]","By Eversource
After a long, cold winter, warmer weather is finally here and many of us have been looking forward to shutting off the heat, packing away the coats, and spending more time outside. We all know how hot Connecticut summers can be, and it’s only a matter of time before the return of those scorching temperatures has us turning on the fans and cranking up the air conditioners again. But even with electric rates dropping this summer, it’s important to remember that when the mercury climbs, energy usage typically does too—and that’s what can cause your bill to spike.
Think of it this way: if you buy more groceries, you’d expect to pay more at checkout. If you drive your car more often than usual, you’d expect to pay more in gasoline. The more you use, the more you pay, and your energy bill is no different, as the most of it is based on usage. In Connecticut, the average residential customer uses about 35% more electricity to keep cool during the summer months. Last year, due to a record-breaking summer with multiple heat waves, that increase was even greater, and customers certainly saw the change reflected in their energy bills.
While the significant increase to the Public Benefits portion of the bill in July 2024 was one of the factors that led to higher bills last summer, usage was the number-one reason for the dramatic surge customers saw. If a homeowner used the exact same amount of energy from June to July last year (approximately 700 kWh on average), their Eversource electric bill would have increased by about $8. Even though Public Benefits increased, and Standard Service (the supply rate Eversource purchased from power generators for customers) decreased substantially at the same time, many of us saw an increase far larger than $8 on our summer bills — because of higher usage.
But those are last year’s numbers. What can you expect this year? There are two rate decreases happening. The first started May 1 with the Public Benefits portion of the bill going down. An average Eversource residential customer saw their total bill decrease by approximately $13.50. Energy supply is also expected to go down starting July 1, but even with those two decreases, you shouldn’t be surprised to see your bill go up this summer because of increased energy usage. 

How much energy you use, and therefore how much your bill total will be, depends on several factors, and weather is a big one. If blistering hot days dominate the summer months, your usage will naturally increase. Even if you keep your thermostat set at the same temperature, on a 90-degree day your system works much harder to keep your home or business cool compared to an 80-degree day, which means your usage has increased. 
This may leave you wondering: is there anything I can do to help keep costs down this summer? The answer is yes. Customers can take advantage of energy efficiency measures and programs because it all adds up and makes a difference for your bottom line. Setting your thermostat one degree higher can mean your air conditioner is using one to three percent less electricity. Turning on your major appliances, like dryers and dishwashers, in the morning or late evening hours means you’re not adding heat to your home during the hottest parts of the day. Switching to LEDs means your lights are running cooler and, as a bonus, last a lot longer than incandescent lights. For the windows that get a lot of sunlight shining in, closing the blinds will also help keep your home cooler. In addition, we offer a variety of energy efficiency programs that can help lower your usage and save money on certain products, as well as financial assistance and payment plans that can help you manage your monthly bills. 
We all want to stay cool during the summer months, but that doesn’t mean you can’t stay on budget too. We hope that by sharing these tips, tools, and information about the many solutions available to our customers, we can help you accomplish both.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)One afternoon not long ago, I walked the south lawn of the state Capitol at Topeka, camera in hand, seeking inspiration. I wasn’t looking for photographic subjects exactly, but something deeper, some sign or cypher that might be a key to hope in the early months of 2025.
Simply put, I was bone tired.
The American carnival of politics had left me numb.
During the five years I’ve written this column, I’ve shared my concern, anxiety, and outrage over state and national politics. I have at times warned of uncharted terrain and at others admitted fear, but now I must convey an existential cultural exhaustion. It is something that reaches down to the personal.
A week or so before driving the 58 miles from my front steps to roam the Capitol lawn, as we got into the Jeep to run some errand, Kim paused and pointed to the roof of our house. A course of shingles, about the size of a door, was missing on the south side, exposing the wood decking beneath. She had found the wind-ripped shingles on the ground on the other side of the house, but we hadn’t known where they had come from until that moment.
The bare patch of wood deck was over the center of the house. Below it was our second-floor bedroom, and below that was the living room where I played acoustic guitar a couple of times a week. The house is more than 100 years old, but the roof was rather new, and as I looked up at where the shingles had been, I imagined rainwater pouring into the heart of the house. I’m handy with tools when I’ve a mind to, but I’m afraid of heights. I muttered something to Kim about not worrying, that I would find somebody to climb up and fix it, but inside me something was shrieking like a stall alarm on a Cessna 172. There had been a series of weather-related challenges at home over the past two years, including a favorite maple tree blowing down on the garage. Due to professional setbacks, money was tight.
The missing shingles felt personal.
Those shingles were still on my mind when I went to Topeka for lunch business. I had placed a call to the contractor who originally put on the roof but had not yet received a response. At least the sky was clear that afternoon.
After lunch, I drove over and parked at the meters on the other side of the street from Capitol Police headquarters. I plugged the meter with four quarters, enough for an hour, and then slung my old Canon DSLR camera over my shoulder. There were a few people on the sidewalk, bags over their shoulders coming to or from work, and a handful of workman at the east entrance to the Capitol. But when I followed the sidewalk to the south lawn I found myself alone, amid green lawns, a few statues, and the immensity of the copper-domed building rising before me.
The solitude was restful.
I passed a sculpture of a seated Abraham Lincoln on my journey, then approached the Capitol and photographed a number of architectural features, steps, columns, pediments. I circled the flower beds. I went over and examined a ground-level replica of the Ad Astra statue atop the statehouse dome, an eight-foot Kansa warrior with drawn bow. Then I wandered back to the Lincoln statue, which I found oddly comforting.
The seated Lincoln faces away from the Capitol. One hand rests on a lanky knee. The face is of the bearded Lincoln, the one familiar to us from the profile on our pennies and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and Alexander Gardner’s 1865 “cracked plate” photograph. But while Gardner’s portrait carries a hint of a smile, the Lincoln on the state Capitol lawn is full of care and sorrow.
This sorrowful Lincoln offered wisdom.
I’m no Lincoln scholar. I cannot tell you anything about the flawed and fated man who led the nation through its greatest trial that you cannot read in a dozen biographies. Doris Kearns Goodwin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who wrote “Team of Rivals,” has said that Lincoln suffered from depressive episodes so severe that his friends removed all razors and scissors from his room. Jon Meacham, another presidential historian, author of “There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,” has said Lincoln “was a politician — but a politician ultimately driven by conscience.”
Knowing that Lincoln went through dark periods of depression and managed to redeem the soul of America gives me hope. It isn’t an expectation that I am personally destined for greatness, but it is proof that seemingly overwhelming burdens can be endured.
I sometimes declare in my weaker periods that I can’t stand things anymore.
Kim observes: “And yet there you stand.”
Indeed, here we all stand. We may be frightened, anxious, at the end of collective or individual ropes, but as long as we remain standing we are not yet beaten. The primary task before us is to endure. To help others, we must ourselves remain on our feet.
The bronze statue of Lincoln at the Kansas Capitol was the first public commission by Merrell Gage. It was unveiled Feb. 12, 1918.
Gage, a 1911 graduate of Topeka High School, later studied sculpture with Gutzon Borglum, a bigot who carved Mount Rushmore. Gage, who taught for 33 years at the University of Southern California, considered Lincoln an “inexhaustible” subject. In 1955, Gage was the subject of a short documentary in which he sculpted the head of Lincoln from clay while talking about the president’s life. The film won an Oscar. Gage died in 1981.
Gage was an artist of his time, an era when poet Carl Sandburg produced a hagiographic biography of Lincoln that is now recognized as being more literature and less fact. But it is Sandburg’s Lincoln, perhaps more than any other single work, that shaped the perception of the 16th president as a benevolent and martyred father.
Each American generation interprets Lincoln anew. While Gage likely had Sandburg’s Lincoln in mind, my interpretation of Lincoln has been shaped by Goodwin and Meacham and others, including Steven Spielberg. It has also been skewed by Richard Nixon’s manic and impromptu visit with anti-war protestors at the Lincoln Memorial one night in May 1970. Lincoln continues to evolve in my understanding, as the dangers facing democracy have deepened.
These dangers have sharpened so fast that it is worth a moment to recount. It is the most grotesque freak show of any carnival midway.
Eighty years of global leadership has been endangered by the clumsy authoritarian urges of a president drunk with self-importance and enabled by a Congress controlled by a Quisling majority. The hunt for DEI in government is the new McCarthyism with a bigoted twist, due process is trammeled by mass deportations that send some detainees to a notorious foreign prison, and the U.S. turned its back on longtime military and commercial allies. The rolling crises lurch from the catastrophic to the absurd, from a tariff war that few credible economists understand to an apparatchik-worthy declaration that Veterans Day would be known as “Victory Day for World War I.” And then there is DOGE, the revenge-driven wrecking ball dismantling the federal government in the name of cost-saving efficiency.
All of this was predictable. Anybody who had paid attention to Donald Trump’s insane ramblings or was familiar with Project 2025 knew where we were headed. We are in the midst of a radical transformation of America into a bizarro-world of opposite values. The grifting of the presidency, from Trump’s crypto scam worth billions to the Qatari gift of a $400 million luxury jet to replace Air Force One, should dismay all but surprise none.
What has surprised me is the apparent inability of Democrats to mount a coherent political response. Oh, there have been scattered strong voices –Bernie Saunders, Cory Booker, AOC, Elizabeth Warren — but these seem like cries in the wilderness. Mass political protests, including the May Day event in Topeka, seem to have the most momentum. But at some point, to be effective, protest has to coalesce around a leader with a conscience who is able to articulate the case for democracy and a path forward to a better America.
Meanwhile, we must remain standing.
We do not need another Lincoln — our allotment was one — but we do need a human being and not a seated statue. Where will this individual come from? I have no idea. But they are surely already among us, if only we take the care to recognize them, flaws and all.
This is a time not only for resisting, but for knowing why we resist. American greatness, in the Trumpian sense, is antithetical to American goodness. What is best for democracy — that is, what benefits the most fortunate as well as the least fortunate — is not efficiency but empathy. Governments are not businesses because the goal should be to serve all of the people, not the monied few.
Nobody wants waste. But the touting of cost-cutting efficiencies is a canard to distract us from the unchecked kleptocracy of oligarchs and the influence of foreign princes. To repair this rot, we must engage in a vigorous campaign to restore fundamental American values of dignity, equality, and robust democracy.
I finally reached someone who agreed to come take a look at our roof. He was a young man named Brian who took a couple of days to show up, but who was cheerful and talkative when he did. He extended a ladder above our gutter and climbed up on the roof, walking about as easily as I would in my living room.
He inspected the damage with a practiced eye.
“No problem,” he declared.
The repair was made in half an hour. Brian promised to send a bill, but I never got one.
My weariness will likely continue for a while longer. But I am helped by the knowledge that I don’t have to remain standing forever. I will stand today, and after that I will stand tomorrow. For the places in which I am afraid, there are others who will stand for me. In the places in which others are afraid, I will stand for them.
Statues belong to the past and the future.
The present belongs to the living.

HIGHWAYS:

The average distance driven on I-95 in Connecticut is 11 miles.

Some 180,000 vehicles drive all or part of the 112 miles that I-95 runs through our state.  But even factoring in true interstate drivers (think Florida to Maine), the average distance driven in Connecticut is tiny.  Why?  Because we use I-95 like a local road to avoid Route 1, not just for interstate travel.

Trucks are banned from the Merritt Parkway. But in 1943 trucks were allowed on that roadway as part of the war effort.

But trucks in those days were much lower, easily clearing the bridges.
AVIATION:

The supersonic Concorde was a real gas-guzzler. In the 15 minutes from leaving the gate until takeoff, the jet burned two metric tons of Jet A gas… enough to fly a conventional jet for an hour — from Heathrow in London to Charles DeGaulle Airport in Paris.

Carrying just 100 passengers, The Concorde would burn about a ton of fuel per passenger crossing the Atlantic.

The busiest airport in the world is Atlanta’s Hartsfield International (ATL), handling 108 million passengers last year… almost 296,000 a day.

And most of them fly Delta, which hosts 165 of the airport’s 192 gates, a 86% share of the capacity. 

This is a January 21, 1976 photo of a British Airways Concorde as it makes its inaugural flight from Heathrow Airport in London.   Credit: AP Photo/Dave Caulkin
METRO-NORTH:

Did you know that a fully loaded eight-car train on Metro-North can carry over 1,000 passengers… more than double the capacity of a fully loaded 747.
The 24-mile-long Danbury branch line used to be electrified. But the wires were ripped out in 1961 to save money by running diesels. The copper was sold as scrap.
Grand Central Terminal has 67 tracks and 44 platforms, more than any station in the world.

And never call it “Grand Central Station.”  That’s the name of the post office and subway station nearby.
HIGH SPEED RAIL:

America’s only “high speed train” (Acela) can go up to 160 mph. But the average speed it runs traveling 456 miles from Washington, D.C. to Boston is just 70 mph.
China has the largest high speed network in the world covering more than 29,000 miles and carrying 4 billion passenger trips. Its trains run as fast as 260 mph.

TRANSIT FARES:

In Portland Oregon the trains don’t have “Senior” fares. Instead, Seniors, Veterans, active-duty military personnel, handicapped and low-income residents are called “Honored Citizens” and get 50 – 75% off regular fares.

SHIPPING:

The biggest container ships sailing today can carry over 24,000 containers.

But those mega-ships are too big for the Panama Canal… but not for the Suez Canal, which has no locks.

New York’s Staten Island Ferry can carry over 6,000 passengers per trip. That added up to 25 million passengers in 2019… more than double the population of Greece.

And yes, the Staten Island Ferry is free.  The old 50 cent fare was dropped in 1997 in a nod to the city’s efforts to make access to the tiny borough more affordable.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ap-chinese-rail.jpg,,,2025-05-18 05:00:52.503172

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A major elections reform bill, a priority of House and Senate leaders, is dead in the Alaska Legislature.
Wednesday is the last day of the regular legislative session, and members of the House’s multipartisan majority said on Saturday that they lack the support needed to overcome the opposition of the House’s Republican minority in the time they have left.
Bills don’t expire at the end of the first year of the two-year legislative session, but Senate Bill 64 needed to become law this year in order to be implemented in time for the 2026 election.
Among the changes in the bill: Speedier ballot counting, better tracking of absentee ballots, ballot dropboxes across the state, free return postage for absentee ballots, a liaison to help fix voting issues in rural Alaska, permanent absentee ballot registration, a method to fix paperwork problems after an absentee ballot is cast, the elimination of the requirement that a “witness” sign a voter’s absentee ballot, and additional security audits.
Many of the House’s Republicans objected to the bill, saying that they believe it did not do enough to address their concerns about election security.
The Senate passed SB 64 on Monday, but Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome and co-chair of the House Finance Committee said that House Republicans were prepared to offer so many amendments to the bill that it would have required members of the House to abandon all other work in order to push the bill across the finish line. Even then, it could have been vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican. 
With those possibilities in play, the House majority’s 14 Democrats, five independents and two Republicans met behind closed doors and decided to abandon the effort. 
“The caucus just said, ‘We’re either gonna have to set everything else aside and focus on that, and probably still won’t get it through, or we just say we’re going to have to set it aside,’” Foster said.
“We all decided as a group that … to try to do it in four days, it was not good public process. If we had two weeks, that would have been fast tracking it, and maybe we could have gotten it through,” he said.
A disproportionately large number of absentee ballots are rejected from rural Alaska in each election cycle, and Foster — in charge of scheduling bills for the House Finance Committee — said he really wanted to see SB 64 advance, but it was clear that it wasn’t possible, barring an unlikely special session.
Late Friday, as the bill’s fate became clear, the Republican minority issued a triumphant news release.
“This bill greases the skids for all mail-in elections like Anchorage has. SB 64 is the biggest hoax that the Democrats have promulgated so far this year — and that is saying a lot since there are some other bills that are contenders,” said Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, in the message. “Alaskans should be appalled. Talk about a bill that will bring out more fraud! SB 64 is the Election Fraud bill!”
Other Republican opponents were more measured.
“Rushing a nonpartisan bill through at the last minute isn’t how the legislative process is meant to work. I’m glad we’ll have the chance to take a closer look at SB 64 next year,” said Rep. Frank Tomaszewski, R-Fairbanks, in the news release.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and the lead person pushing SB 64, noted that this is the third time in the past three legislative sessions that the Legislature has failed to pass a significant elections bill.
“I know there’s groups out there that are looking at ballot initiatives. Very frankly, at this point, they’re just so frustrated with the Legislature because it’s been a decade working on this bill,” he said. “So I think if we don’t get something done this year, you’re going to start seeing some people talk about just doing an initiative for the sections that they want.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)There will be no extra money for the University of Alaska’s sports teams, its effort to become a top-tier research university or its attempts to hire and keep staff.
On Friday, the legislative committee assigned to write the final version of Alaska’s state operating budget axed all of those items — and many more — from its in-progress draft.
Alaska is facing a severe budget crunch, thanks to low oil prices and reduced federal spending, and lawmakers are eliminating almost every previously considered addition, even before Gov. Mike Dunleavy gets a chance to use his veto pen.
Flat funding, combined with inflation, means cuts for most state services. The Permanent Fund dividend isn’t immune, either. It’s expected to be about $1,000 this year, the lowest figure in state history, once adjusted for inflation.
“It’s just a really challenging time, and there’s a lot of volatility, and Alaska’s heavily dependent upon federal funds,” said Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks. “We don’t have that huge buffer of oil and gas funds that we once did.”
Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, appeared resigned to the decisions when asked for comment.
“It is what it is,” he said.
Among the university’s budget cuts is $150,000 for a staff member to help the university’s efforts on diversity, equity and inclusion. The University’s Board of Regents voted earlier this year to cancel DEI efforts, including those intended to help Alaska Native students.
“We obviously are cut down to the bone if we’re talking about individual, singular positions in the budget, and the board of regents has taken a position that’s alternative to what I think the UA community broadly wants to see happen, so it puts our Legislature as an appropriating body in a really difficult position making those kinds of decisions,” said Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks.
The budget maneuvering isn’t restricted to the University of Alaska. At the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, legislators have cut road maintenance spending and have requested a report on the feasibility of turning the Dalton Highway — Alaska’s overland link to the North Slope — into a toll road.
A plan to put more Alaska state troopers in Kotzebue to fight child abuse crimes was only partially funded, and $2.3 million for additional trooper overtime was trimmed to $1 million. 
The conference committee, in charge of combining different budget drafts approved by the state House and Senate, may also cancel plans for additional state and wildlife troopers in Talkeetna.
Legislators are asking DPS to begin meeting with the Kenai, Fairbanks and Matanuska-Susitna boroughs about setting up local police in those areas in order to replace troopers.
“It is the intent of the legislature to direct public safety funds to areas of the state that do not have the tax base to provide needed policing services to their communities,” the latest budget draft states.
A few budget increases remain — $250,000 more for maintenance at the state’s trial courts, $292,000 more for security screening of legislative mail, and additional state funding for Alaska’s forestry program as part of an effort to increase logging.
For the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, the conference committee approved backstop funding for public schools in case Dunleavy vetoes House Bill 57, which would permanently increase the state’s per-student funding formula.
The backstop language includes a one-time bonus that’s slightly smaller than the increase included within HB 57. That increase is itself lower than the rate of inflation.
The committee declined to increase funding for special education, child nutrition, early education, and state libraries, archives and museums. But lawmakers did approve an increase for career and technical education initiatives.
They temporarily postponed a decision on items related to foreign teacher recruitment and training, at the request of Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage.
Those may be taken up as soon as Sunday.
The committee approved $5.5 million for child advocacy centers, which support child victims of physical and sexual abuse. That money was added after the federal government cut funding for the centers.
For the state prison system, the budget directs the closure of part of Spring Creek Correctional Center and directs the Alaska Department of Corrections to prepare a report for the Legislature evaluating which prisons would provide the most cost savings if closed. Budget negotiators also rejected increased funding for vocational training programs intended to aid Alaskans who leave the prison system. 
Several items are still being debated, and the conference committee was scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. Sunday to finalize the compromise budget draft.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)The Utah GOP’s state delegates have charted the next chapter for the state’s dominant political party — sticking with an incumbent who characterized himself as a “bridge builder” rather than a burner.
With nearly 67% turnout during their organizing convention at Utah Valley University in Orem on Saturday, 2,645 Utah Republican Party state delegates voted to reelect Rob Axson as their party chair, handing another loss to his challenger and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Phil Lyman.
Axson won with about 54% (1,430 votes), to Lyman’s nearly 46% (1,215 votes), according to the party’s election results. 
The vote settled what many delegates considered a toss-up contest — but Axson won with a healthy majority. Though Lyman and his “Make Utah Great Again” campaign was given a warm reception with loud cheers from passionate supporters, Axson was a formidable incumbent, buoyed by an endorsement from President Donald Trump about a week before the convention. 
To Axson, his victory showed delegates “want to see more” of what he’s started in the Utah Republican Party. 
“They want to see additional momentum. They want to see growth,” Axson told reporters after his win. “They’ve seen what I’ve delivered over the last two years … and that is now the new foundation. Let’s build from there.”

Axson vs. Lyman
Axson — who championed his fundraising record as chair of the party since 2023 and framed himself as a “bridge builder” rather than a burner — was also endorsed by other Utah Republican Party heavyweights, including Sen. Mike Lee and other Utahns in Congress, as well as high-ranking state leaders including House Speaker Mike Schultz, and former party chair Carson Jorgensen.
Axson or Lyman? Utah Republican delegates to elect their next leader

Lyman, on the other hand, campaigned against the “establishment,” continuing a barrage of unsubstantiated claims that he peddled during his unsuccessful bid last year against Gov. Spencer Cox that there’s “corruption” and election fraud in Utah government. 
In the end, though, delegates signaled they liked the track Axson has put the party on over the last two years, while they rejected Lyman’s pitch for a more combative — perhaps even unlawful — future GOP. 
While challenging Axson for party chair, Lyman painted himself as a leader who would position the Utah GOP to more aggressively assert its capability to select Republican nominees rather than follow SB54, a 2014 state law that allows a dual path to the primary through both the caucus and convention process and through signature gathering. 
Though Axson also agreed Utah Republicans should continue fighting SB54, he disagreed with taking Lyman’s approach, which Axson argued would amount to breaking the law. Instead, Axson said the party should focus on working with the Utah Legislature to change the law. 
During his speech, Axson told delegates that SB54 “still undermines the principles of our party.” However, he also said “the law is the law, and claiming otherwise is not a strategy for success, no matter how loudly you do so.”

“We must repeal SB54, but we cannot unless we are united,” he said. “We can’t beat SB54 if we spend all our time beating one another.”
Without naming Lyman during his speech, Axson said there’s a “clear difference between me and others: I am not willing to break the law, especially to break the law in a way that will jeopardize our Republican candidates and force them to get signatures instead of leaning into the delegate process that we all believe in.” 
Axson also touted the endorsement from Trump, along with support from members of Utah’s congressional delegation and others.
“Ultimately if we want to be successful beyond the next 20 years, if we hope to bring the next generation into the Republican Party, we must build,” he said. 
Lyman, during his speech, didn’t specifically address SB54 or specifics about his vision as party leader, but he focused on his philosophical stance for a government that “belongs to the people.”

“I wish that I lived in 1765 back in Boston,” Lyman said, adding that if he did, “I would have been a member of the Sons of Liberty,” referring to a secretive and sometimes violent political organization in the 13 American Colonies that worked to fight taxation by the British government. 
“I would have been there in 1770 when the Boston Massacre occurred, I would have been there in 1773 when the (Boston) Tea Party took place,” Lyman said. “Because those people were pushing back against the government that did not have their interests at heart. That’s what we’re about.”
Lyman said the Sons of Liberty were “called all kinds of horrible names too, including bridge burners, but they actually burned bridges to impede the direction of their enemy.” 
Lyman also issued a call to action to unite Utah Republicans, regardless of the outcome of the race for GOP chair. 
“From this point, we will be united,” he said. “I will stand behind Rob Axson. He’s a friend of mine. I love Donald Trump, he’s my president. I’ve supported him. I appreciate Sen. Lee. … I recognize their efforts, I support them.”
But Lyman concluded his speech by telling delegates “this is a time for you.” 
“This is your party. The Republican Party is yours. And today you will decide what direction this party takes,” he said, to loud cheers.

Continued angst with SB54
On full display throughout the convention was Republican delegates’ continued hatred of SB54.  Utah lawmakers passed the law more than 10 years ago as a compromise to ward off a looming ballot initiative to do away with the caucus and convention system altogether in favor of signature gathering. 
But ever since, Utah Republican Party caucus system loyalists have despised the law, even though it’s survived multiple court challenges that almost drove the Utah GOP to bankruptcy. It’s become one of the largest wedges dividing Utah Republicans, and Republicans’ strategy to continue fighting it was at the heart of the contest between Axson and Lyman. 
But if there was an early indication that most delegates weren’t in favor of taking a scorched earth approach to challenge SB54 further, one of the first votes they took Saturday morning was to strip from the agenda a proposed amendment to the party’s constitution that would temporarily revoke a Republican candidate’s party membership if they gain access to the ballot through signature gathering rather than through the caucus and convention system.

State law specifies two types of political parties: registered parties and qualified political parties. Candidates of registered parties must use signature gathering to access the ballot, while candidates of qualified parties (a designation the Utah GOP currently functions under), can either gather signatures or be nominated at convention. Utah law does not have a designation that lets parties only allow ballot access through nomination. 
If the state GOP’s proposed amendment to strip a candidate’s party membership for using a legal pathway to the ballot had passed, it would have violated state law and possibly could have led to yet another court challenge. 
The amendment’s sponsor, Arnold Gaunt, motioned to remove it from the agenda, saying “there’s a better path for responding to the problem.” 
Axson told reporters that he’s “not a fan” of SB54 and the signature gathering path, but he  focused his message on “not lawsuits, not division, not purity tests. It’s building something that can’t be ignored.” 
“If we build an apparatus that every Utahn and every community feels that there’s a value in that, well they’re going to come along with us,” Axson said. “They’re going to be supportive of what we’re trying to do, and the Legislature is going to listen to that.”

Axson said his preference would be for the Legislature to repeal SB54. Pressed on whether that’s a real possibility, he told reporters “the votes are there in the House” while they’re “not there yet in the Senate.” 
“But it can’t be a vitriolic conversation. It’s not threats. It has to be a conversation that’s transparent and up front and collaborative,” Axson said. “If we can show the value of what the Republican Party is doing … and trying to grow and build additional capacity, we make it a lot easier on these elected officials to take the hard votes of repealing SB54.” 
However, Axson acknowledged “it’s going to take some time.” 
“How long or how short that is, I don’t know,” Axson said. “But I do know we have in our ability the opportunity to build a strong party, and that will be a benefit in repealing SB54 or solving other complex issues.” 
Axson’s influential supporters 
The morning of the convention, Axson’s predecessor, former Utah GOP Chair Carson Jorgensen, was chatting up delegates wearing an Axson button on his shirt. He said Axson is the right leader for the party, lauding him as a proven organizer and fundraiser who helped bring the party out of bankruptcy after multiple failed legal challenges of SB54. 
Jorgensen said Axson will take the right approach by focusing on working with lawmakers to strengthen the caucus-convention system rather than more lawsuits. 
Are delegates in touch with Utah voters? Survey reveals where they ‘align and diverge’

“I like Phil personally as a friend, I think he’s a nice guy,” Jorgensen said. “But here’s the thing. There are three ways we’re going to navigate SB54, and only three. One is the lawsuit route. We’ve tried it. It doesn’t work. Phil is 0 for 5 on lawsuits. The party can’t afford another lawsuit.”
Jorgensen said the next option is a “legislative fix,” which requires a “relationship with the Legislature.” 
“Sorry, but Phil has burned every — every — bridge he had with any legislator,” Jorgensen said. 
The last option, he said, is the party opts to hold its own primary. 
“What does that take? Money,” Jorgensen said. “If the party’s going to hold their own primary, they’ve got to fund it. We figure between $1.5 and $3 million to run it. Rob has shown he can raise that kind of money.” 
So Axson has “two of the three that need to happen, and Phil doesn’t have any,” Jorgensen concluded. “That’s why I support Rob.” 
Jorgensen also issued a call to Utah Republicans to set their differences aside and coalesce behind the new chair. 
 “Everybody needs to get back on the same page. This has been a pretty toxic election,” he said, adding that someone recently called him an “establishment RHINO hack.” To that, he said, “you obviously don’t know me and you’re on the wrong side of things, because you don’t find anybody more conservative than I am.” 
Utah’s SB54 still stands despite 10 years of angst. Will lawmakers change it?

Another Axson supporter seen mingling with delegates was House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, who was also acting as a delegate Saturday. He told Utah News Dispatch that he’d be voting for Axson for party chair “because we need somebody to bring all sides together.” 
“That’s what we do in the Legislature,” Schultz said. “We have to work to find common ground.”
Why not Lyman? Schultz declined to comment, focusing his remarks instead on his support of Axson. Trump’s endorsement of Axson, Schultz said, indicates Trump “has noticed something different about Utah.” 
“He has embraced Utah and sees Utah as being able to help push the agenda that he’s pushing on a nationwide level,” Schultz said. “I think that’s why you saw President Trump chime in and say, what you’re doing in Utah is working, stick with it.” 
Schultz added that Utah Republicans need to realize “if we split up our party, we lose.” 
“If the party gets split, it’s the best thing that can happen for Democrats in the state of Utah,” he said. “So finding ways to keep the party together keeps Utah Republican, it keeps Utah conservative. That’s what President Trump sees and that’s why I’m supporting Rob Axson.” 
How will Utah lawmakers tackle SB54? 
Pressed on efforts to repeal SB54, Schultz told Utah News Dispatch he and lawmakers are open to working with the Utah Republican Party to find a path forward that’s focused on strengthening the caucus and convention system — but he also warned that completely undoing SB54 could have negative consequences. 
“Count My Vote has been very open and saying that they will run a ballot initiative that does away with the caucus convention altogether,” he said. “I think that would be very harmful to the grassroots of our party.” 
Schultz added: “I love the caucus convention system because it does keep money out of politics. So I would like to look for ways to make the caucus and convention system stronger and get their people involved in the caucus and convention system.” 
“That is a good pathway forward,” he said, but he didn’t offer any specifics of what that could look like in legislative action. 
“I truly don’t know,” he said, “but I think we need to understand the consequences of (undoing SB54). We look at the polling, and it’s not even close. If it goes to ballot initiative, we lose the caucus and convention system. And I think that would be horrible. I would rather find ways to make the caucus and convention system stronger.”

The ‘MUGA’ message that resonated with many, but failed
Wearing a maroon MUGA hat in support of Lyman, Tiffany Mendenhall, of Ivins, said she was all in favor of Lyman for chair. 
Signature audit finds ‘some errors’ — but Cox still ultimately qualified for primary

“Lyman has our best interest at heart,” she said, adding that she didn’t like the outcome of the governor’s race last year and the direction the Utah GOP has been heading. “Phil is very well aware of what’s going on with all the crookedness and all of that stuff. He intends to get us back to more traditional voting methods so that there’s no fraud.” 
Though Utah’s election was certified and Cox legally qualified as a Republican candidate before he went on to win the election, Mendenhall said she believed the governor’s race was “absolutely stolen,” arguing he “didn’t have the signatures.” 
While signature gathering audits did find “some errors” and that based on statistical error rates Cox could have initially fallen short of the 28,000-signature requirement, auditors also reported that had clerks told him he hadn’t qualified (which they didn’t), he would have had 28 days more days to submit enough signatures. Ultimately, the audits concluded Cox followed the law and qualified for the primary.
Mendenhall, however, stood firm on the false claim that Lyman has repeatedly pushed throughout both his gubernatorial and Utah GOP chair campaigns — that Cox was an illegitimate candidate and “stole” the election.
“You can’t tell us that it wasn’t. And so how can we feel that we have a fair election when our governor in charge is a cheat?” Mendenhall said. She argued Axson hasn’t done enough to challenge what happened during the governor’s race. “He hasn’t stood up to take care of this. This shouldn’t have happened.”

Photo by Andrew VonBank/House Public Information Services.With just over 48 hours prior to the Legislature’s mandatory adjournment midnight Monday, lawmakers are still struggling to resolve a few key issues as they aim for a two-year budget to fund everything from roads to schools, parks, health and social services.
Several large budget bills have yet to be negotiated between the 67-67 divided House and the Democratic-controlled Senate — health and human services, education, a potential infrastructure package and a tax bill — i.e., the most complex and contentious.
The lack of movement on these bills makes a special session all the more likely. Legislative leaders say they anticipate a one-day special session prior to Memorial Day, though it could be longer.
Lawmakers have to pass a budget by June 30 or the government will shut down.
Among the major sticking points: cutting MinnesotaCare for undocumented immigrant adults. Some rank-and-file, progressive Democrats broke with their leaders and Gov. Tim Walz and protested the budget agreement over the proposal and harshly criticized Democratic leadership for acquiescing to one of the Republicans’ top priorities.
House DFL Caucus leader Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, appearing Friday on TPT Almanac, said Democrats will need to compromise given the divided government.
“People need to bend. They need to understand they won’t get everything they want,” Hortman said.
Rep. Cedric Frazier, DFL-New Hope, who is also co-chair of the progressive People of Color and Indigenous Caucus, told reporters Saturday that the POCI Caucus doesn’t plan to shut down the government over cutting MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults.
“We care about all the Minnesotans, and we’re not willing to shut the government down, but we’re willing to make sure we work very hard to ensure the Minnesotans get what they need,” Frazier said.
Other contentious debates include potential changes to the state’s new paid leave and earned sick and safe time programs and cuts to taxpayer aid for private schools.
Walz has proposed cutting $109 million in aid that helps private schools with transportation, counseling and textbooks. The state has allocated this funding to private schools for decades, but Walz and Democrats are proposing the cuts amid a projected multi-billion dollar budget deficit beginning in 2027.
On Thursday, House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, gave reporters the impression that private school aid would not be touched and presented this as a win for Republicans.
“We also know that we have made great strides in protecting the funding for non-public education. We are protecting our schools,” Demuth said. “We are protecting our students so they can learn in the best way forward.”
But cuts to private school aid are still in play, as far as a key DFL senator is concerned.
Sen. Mary Kunesh, DFL-New Brighton, said that funding for private school aid wasn’t part of the global budget agreement, and protecting public education is a priority for Senate Democrats.
“I understand the uniqueness and the value of non-public schools, but as the chair of the Education Finance Committee in the state of Minnesota, my priority is to fund public schools at the best rate and in the best way possible,” Kunesh said in an interview with the Reformer.
A source with the House Republican caucus told the Reformer that there’s “no scenario where we will agree to” any cuts.
Kunesh, who also serves as an assistant majority leader, said that the cuts to private schools are part of her education budget, and she anticipates this issue to be a sticking point in budget negotiations between members of the House and Senate — also known as a conference committee.
“We just have to remind those members also that we have that obligation to public schools first,” Kunesh said. 
In between the Senate and House floor sessions, Rep. Dave Baker, R-Wilmar, and Sen. Judy Seeberger, DFL-Afton, held a small press gaggle near the Capitol rotunda to tell reporters that significant changes to the state’s paid leave and earned sick and safe time programs are still on the table, despite their absence from the legislative leaders’ budget agreement.
Legislative leaders agreed to reduce the paid leave payroll tax cap that the Department of Employment and Economic Development could implement each year from 1.2% to 1.1%. But since paid leave will launch in January with a 0.88% payroll tax split between employers and workers, the reduction does nothing to change the program as currently constituted.
Baker said Demuth has given him her blessing to keep trying to implement paid leave changes in conference committee, though he didn’t say what he would specifically look to change. Throughout the session, Baker has attempted to exempt small employers from the paid leave requirement.
“We’re just trying to get (paid leave) right-sized a little bit,” Baker told reporters.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrLrAVuXkAAtEyn-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-05-17 19:03:33.120583

(Jackie Fortíer/KFF Health News)In the dim basement of a Salt Lake City pharmacy, hundreds of amber-colored plastic pill bottles sit stacked in rows, one man’s defensive wall in a tariff war.
Independent pharmacist Benjamin Jolley and his colleagues worry that the tariffs, aimed at bringing drug production to the United States, could instead drive companies out of business while raising prices and creating more of the drug shortages that have plagued American patients for several years.
Jolley bought six months’ worth of the most expensive large bottles, hoping to shield his business from the 10% across-the-board tariffs on imported goods that President Donald Trump announced April 2. Now with threats of additional tariffs targeting pharmaceuticals, Jolley worries that costs will soar for the medications that will fill those bottles.
In principle, Jolley said, using tariffs to push manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. makes sense. In the event of war, China could quickly stop all exports to the United States.
“I understand the rationale for tariffs. I’m not sure that we’re gonna do it the right way,” Jolley said. “And I am definitely sure that it’s going to raise the price that I pay my suppliers.”

Squeezed by insurers and middlemen, independent pharmacists such as Jolley find themselves on the front lines of a tariff storm. Nearly everyone down the line — drugmakers, pharmacies, wholesalers, and middlemen — opposes most tariffs.
Slashing drug imports could trigger widespread shortages, experts said, because of America’s dependence on Chinese- and Indian-made chemical ingredients, which form the critical building blocks of many medicines. Industry officials caution that steep tariffs on raw materials and finished pharmaceuticals could make drugs more expensive.
“Big ships don’t change course overnight,” said Robin Feldman, a UC Law San Francisco professor who writes about prescription drug issues. “Even if companies pledge to bring manufacturing home, it will take time to get them up and running. The key will be to avoid damage to industry and pain to consumers in the process.”
Trump on April 8 said he would soon announce “a major tariff on pharmaceuticals,” which have been largely tariff-free in the U.S. for 30 years.
“When they hear that, they will leave China,” he said. The U.S. imported $213 billion worth of medicines in 2024 — from China but also India, Europe, and other areas.
Trump’s statement sent drugmakers scrambling to figure out whether he was serious, and whether some tariffs would be levied more narrowly, since many parts of the U.S. drug supply chain are fragile, drug shortages are common, and upheaval at the FDA leaves questions about whether its staffing is adequate to inspect factories, where quality problems can lead to supply chain crises.
Private equity snaps up disability services, challenging state regulators

On May 12, Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to bring down the prices Americans pay for prescriptions, to put them in line with prices in other countries.
Meanwhile, pharmacists predict even the 10% tariffs Trump has demanded will hurt: Jolley said a potential increase of up to 30 cents a vial is not a king’s ransom, but it adds up when you’re a small pharmacy that fills 50,000 prescriptions a year.
“The one word that I would say right now to describe tariffs is ‘uncertainty,’” said Scott Pace, a pharmacist and owner of Kavanaugh Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas.
To weather price fluctuations, Pace stocked up on the drugs his pharmacy dispenses most.
“I’ve identified the top 200 generics in my store, and I have basically put 90 days’ worth of those on the shelf just as a starting point,” he said. “Those are the diabetes drugs, the blood pressure medicines, the antibiotics — those things that I know folks will be sicker without.”
Pace said tariffs could be the death knell for the many independent pharmacies that exist on “razor-thin margins” — unless reimbursements rise to keep up with higher costs.
Unlike other retailers, pharmacies can’t pass along such costs to patients. Their payments are set by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers largely owned by insurance conglomerates, who act as middlemen between drug manufacturers and purchasers.
Neal Smoller, who employs 15 people at his Village Apothecary in Woodstock, New York, is not optimistic.
“It’s not like they’re gonna go back and say, well, here’s your 10% bump because of the 10% tariff,” he said. “Costs are gonna go up and then the sluggish responses from the PBMs — they’re going to lead us to lose more money at a faster rate than we already are.”
Smoller, who said he has built a niche selling vitamins and supplements, fears that FDA firings will mean fewer federal inspections and safety checks.
“I worry that our pharmaceutical industry becomes like our supplement industry, where it’s the wild West,” he said.
Narrowly focused tariffs might work in some cases, said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Health Policy. For example, while drug manufacturing plants can cost $1 billion and take three to five years to set up, it would be relatively cheap to build a syringe factory — a business American manufacturers abandoned during the covid-19 pandemic because China was dumping its products here, Wosińska said.
It’s not surprising that giants such as Novartis and Eli Lilly have promised Trump they’ll invest billions in U.S. plants, she said, since much of their final drug product is made here or in Europe, where governments negotiate drug prices. The industry is using Trump’s tariff saber-rattling as leverage; in an April 11 letter, 32 drug companies demanded European governments pay them more or face an exodus to the United States.
Brandon Daniels, CEO of supply chain company Exiger, is bullish on tariffs. He thinks they could help bring some chemical manufacturing back to the U.S., which, when coupled with increased use of automation, would reduce the labor advantages of China and India.
“You’ve got real estate in North Texas that’s cheaper than real estate in Shenzhen,” he said at an economic conference April 25 in Washington, referring to a major Chinese chemical manufacturing center.

But Wosińska said no amount of tariffs will compel makers of generic drugs, responsible for 90% of U.S. prescriptions, to build new factories in the U.S. Payment structures and competition would make it economic suicide, she said.
Several U.S. generics firms have declared bankruptcy or closed U.S. factories over the past decade, said John Murphy, CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, the generics trade group. Reversing that trend won’t be easy and tariffs won’t do it, he said.
“There’s not a magic level of tariffs that magically incentivizes them to come into the U.S.,” he said. “There is no room to make a billion-dollar investment in a domestic facility if you’re going to lose money on every dose you sell in the U.S. market.”
His group has tried to explain these complexities to Trump officials, and hopes word is getting through. “We’re not PhRMA,” Murphy said, referring to the powerful trade group primarily representing makers of brand-name drugs. “I don’t have the resources to go to Mar-a-Lago to talk to the president myself.”
Many of the active ingredients in American drugs are imported. Fresenius Kabi, a German company with facilities in eight U.S. states to produce or distribute sterile injectables — vital hospital drugs for cancer and other conditions — complained in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that tariffs on these raw materials could paradoxically lead some companies to move finished product manufacturing overseas.
Fresenius Kabi also makes biosimilars, the generic forms of expensive biologic drugs such as Humira and Stelara. The United States is typically the last developed country where biosimilars appear on the market because of patent laws.
Louisiana considers ‘homelessness courts’ as housing advocates stress lack of resources

Tariffs on biosimilars coming from overseas — where Fresenius makes such drugs — would further incentivize U.S. use of more expensive brand-name biologics, the March 11 letter said. Biosimilars, which can cost a tenth of the original drug’s price, launch on average 3-4 years later in the U.S. than in Canada or Europe.
In addition to getting cheaper knockoff drugs faster, European countries also pay far less than the United States for brand-name products. Paradoxically, Murphy said, those same countries pay more for generics.
European governments tend to establish more stable contracts with makers of generics, while in the United States, “rabid competition” drives down prices to the point at which a manufacturer “maybe scrimps on product quality,” said John Barkett, a White House Domestic Policy Council member in the Biden administration.
As a result, Wosińska said, “without exemptions or other measures put in place, I really worry about tariffs causing drug shortages.”
Smoller, the New York pharmacist, doesn’t see any upside to tariffs.
“How do I solve the problem of caring for my community,” he said, “but not being subject to the emotional roller coaster that is dispensing hundreds of prescriptions a day and watching every single one of them be a loss or 12 cents profit?”

Andy Beshear says at least 14 people are dead after tornadoes, wind and hail tore across Kentucky Friday evening into Saturday morning. Beshear said he expects the death toll from the storms to rise.
The Southeastern Kentucky cities of London and Somerset appear to be especially hard hit by tornadic damage. Somerset Mayor Alan Keck declared a local state of emergency Saturday morning, and London Mayor Randall Weddle told Lexington TV station WKYT that “lives have been changed forever here tonight.” 
Beshear had declared a statewide state of emergency on Friday ahead of the “dangerous” storm system. Beshear wrote on X that five counties had declared a local state of emergency as well. 
“This is another tough morning for Kentucky after a night of deadly weather,” Beshear said in posts on X, mentioning he has spoken with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials. “The devastation from last night’s deadly weather is heartbreaking, but we are going to make sure we get the support needed to recover and rebuild together.”
Social media users on Facebook and X posted pictures of what appears to have been a significant overnight tornado in Southeastern Kentucky. South Kentucky RECC, a local electricity cooperative, stated on Facebook that its building in Somerset took a “major hit.” The London-Corbin airport in Laurel County posted on Facebook drone footage of demolished airport buildings, along with nearby homes sustaining damage as well.

Over 90,000 Kentuckians across Kentucky, from west to southeast, had lost power as of Saturday morning, according to the website PowerOutages.us that compiles power outage data. 
Beshear said in an X post the Red Cross had available space at First Baptist Church of London and that more information on other shelter space would be shared when available. 
State lawmakers from the area issued this joint statement tatement from Sen. Brandon Storm, who represents Laurel County, Sen. Rick Girdler, who represents Pulaski County, and Senate President Robert Stivers, who represents multiple southeastern Kentucky counties:
“This is one of the hardest days our communities and region have faced. Lives have been lost. Families have been shattered. Homes and businesses have been destroyed. Sadly, we expect the loss to grow as search and rescue efforts continue.
“The destruction in Laurel and Pulaski counties is overwhelming, but so is the strength of the people who call this place home. Neighbors are already showing up to help one another, and first responders continue working around the clock.
“Local and state officials are working to get immediate help to those in need. If you’re looking for a way to help, please do. Every act of kindness makes a difference.“Our hearts are heavy today, but our commitment to helping these communities rebuild is even stronger.”

Jeff Landry’s directive to link state law enforcement agencies with federal immigration enforcement is a move toward more illegal policing, a civil rights group leader says. 
Landry issued an executive order this week, which he tabbed “Operation Geaux,” that calls for state agencies to join the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 287(g) program. It’s part of a federal law approved in 1996 that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to delegate its power to enforce federal laws to state and local police agencies.
Louisiana is one of 40 states with active 287(g) agreements with ICE. Hawaii, Delaware, Rhode Island and Vermont have no such agreements in place. California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut have banned them in their respective state laws.

Landry joined ICE officials Thursday to sign the order authorizing the agreement, which he has dubbed Operation Geaux. According to a news release from the governor’s office, it will include “enhanced screening, aggressive identification, and a massive public awareness campaign that is going to wake people up. This isn’t just talk—it’s action. And it’s happening now.”
“If you’re here illegally and you engage in criminal activity, you are going to be deported or sent to jail,” Landry said in the statement.. “Operation Geaux is the kind of historic, one-of-a-kind partnership that the Trump Administration is looking for to fulfill the President’s promises of restoring law and order! Making America Safe Again.”
Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, said in a statement Friday her group opposes Operation Geaux. 
“This blatant targeting of the immigrant population continues to exacerbate racial profiling, instill fear in communities, and put disproportionate numbers of Black and Brown people into the deportation pipeline,” Odoms said. “Moreover, the majority of agencies participating in this program have documented records of civil rights abuses, including beatings and killings.”

As of Friday, ICE had signed 571 memorandums of agreement for 287(g) programs in the 40 participating states. They include 91 Jail Enforcement Model (JEM) agreements, which indicate local detention centers will identify, process and help ICE remove non-citizens with criminal or pending criminal charges. There are 12 more JEM agreements pending, according to ICE.
Another 205 law enforcement agencies in 32 states have agreed to take part in ICE’s Warrant Service Office (WSO) program, which allows the federal agencies to train, certify and authorize state and local police to serve and execute warrants on unauthorized immigrants. There are 29 pending WSO agreements as well.
ICE has also reached Task Force Model agreements with 275 police agencies in 28 states. TFMs are described as “as a force multiplier for law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties,” according to the ICE website. Another 51 TFM agreements were pending as of Friday.  
The only Louisiana law enforcement agencies ICE listed as 287(g) program participants are the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Kenner Police Department. Both had reached Jail Enforcement Model agreements with the federal government. The Beauregard Parish Sheriff’s Office is listed as having a pending Task Force Model agreement.
No state law enforcement agencies in Louisiana are listed in the ICE 287(g) participant or pending records, though the Landry administration has said Louisiana State Police and the state Department of Public Safety and Corrections it falls under will join the program. The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is also expected to sign an 287(g) agreement as well.
State Police assisted ICE with a raid at the Port of Lake Charles in March, when 11 employees of a port contractor were arrested for allegedly not having legal status to work in the U.S.
Former LDWF Secretary Madison Sheahan joined Landry when he signed his executive order. She’s now ICE deputy director, having previously worked as an aide for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when the latter was governor of South Dakota.

While last year's pink salmon runs and harvests were weak, big increases are expected this year. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)After a poor showing last year, Alaska’s statewide commercial salmon harvest appears poised for a rebound, according to projections by state biologists.
This year’s total salmon harvest is expected to be more than twice as big as last year’s total, thanks primarily to stronger returns of pink salmon, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s annual statewide run forecast and commercial harvest projection. The report was released this week.
The department’s projected 2025 total harvest is 214.6 million fish, above the 2000-2023 average of 175 million fish, though well below the record 280 million salmon harvested commercially in 2013. This year’s projected total is much higher than the 103.5 million salmon harvested commercially last year.
If the harvest occurs as projected, it would be the 10th-largest on record, said Forrest Bowers, director of the department’s Division of Commercial Fisheries.
Key to the projection for this year is a much-improved outlook for pink salmon. This year’s harvest of pink salmon, also known as humpback salmon, is expected to exceed last year’s harvest by 98.2 million fish, according to the department.
Pink salmon are the most abundant and low-priced of all five Alaska salmon species. But last year’s harvest of about 40 million pink salmon was considered abysmal, even taking into account the normal pattern of weaker runs in even-numbered years.
The species has a two-year life cycle, the shortest of all Alaska salmon species, and odd-numbered years generally have bigger returns, a pattern that has become especially pronounced in about the last decade, Bowers said.
 

  The year-to-year fluctuations in statewide pink salmon trends since 1970 are shown in this graph from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s 2025 run forecast and harvest projection report. The odd-even-year contrast has become more pronounced in recent years. (Graph provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game)
 

	The department is also forecasting increases in other species: 10.8 million more sockeye, also known as red salmon; 544,000 more coho salmon, also known as silver salmon; and 876,000 more chum salmon.
But for Chinook salmon, also known as king salmon, recent returns and harvests that have been anemic are expected to be even lower this year, according to the department’s forecast.
Last year, Alaska fishermen harvested 244,000 Chinook, according to the department. This year’s harvest is expected to be only 144,000 fish.
Because of poor returns, the state has had to “severely restrict” Chinook harvests in recent years, Bowers said. This year’s projected Chinook totals also reflect obligations under the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty, he said.
The treaty aims to ensure that enough salmon return to spawning grounds to provide adequate fish for harvesters in both countries, a goal that has proved elusive.
For now, there are limited opportunities in Alaska to fish for Chinook, outside of one “directed” fishery where it is intended harvested species.
“Southeast Alaska is the only place that we have a directed Chinook salmon fishery that’s open this year,” Bowers said. Any other Chinook harvesting is done incidentally, with those fish accidentally netted by harvesters targeting other species, he said.
Chinook notwithstanding, there is another way that this year’s commercial harvest is expected to be better than last year’s harvest: The fish will not be as small, biologists believe.
Pacific salmon have been shrinking in size for decades, a trend attributed to climate change, competition for food in the ocean and other conditions. Results of that trend were apparent last year. The average size of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay, the dominant source of Alaska sockeye, was only 4.53 pounds, the smallest on record.
Measured by pounds, the total commercial harvest of Alaska salmon across all species was the third lowest on record, at about 450 million.

	Last year’s slimmed-down average size of Alaska salmon was influenced by the mix of age classes in the Bristol Bay harvest, the state’s dominant source of sockeye salmon. Last year, about 80% of the returning fish were younger, having spent only two years in the ocean, according to the department.
But this year’s returning Bristol Bay salmon are expected to be older, with 63% of them coming back after three years in the ocean, Bowers said.
“As you can imagine, a 3-year ocean fish is going to be larger than a 2-year ocean fish because most of their growth occurs in the ocean,” he said “So if they have an additional year of growth in the ocean, you know, they’re going to be larger than fish that that have spent less time in the ocean.”
Beyond the well-studied Bristol Bay runs, most other salmon runs have either single age classes returning or much less detailed information about age-class distributions, Bowers said. That makes it difficult to predict fish sizes beyond those in the Bristol Bay runs, he said.
The department’s harvest projections are based on forecasts of run sizes compared to the needed levels of “escapement,” the term for fish that reach spawning grounds where they reproduce.  
Once escapement needs are subtracted from projected run sizes, the remaining sum is considered the “harvestable surplus,” which is what the department uses as projected harvest totals, Bowers said.
Whether fishers will do with the harvestable surplus is unknown, he said.
Market conditions influence fishing efforts, the department’s annual statewide forecast notes. Therefore, the numbers calculated “may not be indicative of actual harvests,” it said.

(South Dakota Searchlight photos)It may seem a little early to start wondering about who’s likely to be elected governor of South Dakota in November of 2026. However, November is not the date that’s important. Just more than a year from now, in June 2026, the Republican Party will have its primary election to decide on a gubernatorial candidate. Since Democrats are close to a nonentity in this state, it’s the GOP primary that will likely decide the next governor of South Dakota. 
It was with that timing in mind that South Dakota News Watch, in cooperation with the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota, conducted a poll of 500 registered Republican voters and asked them who they supported for governor. 
A News Watch story accompanying the poll listed some important factors for the success of the candidates: the money they can raise, their name recognition and their standing in the state’s geographic regions. What it didn’t mention was perhaps the most important factor of all: who’s the most likely to get the endorsement of President Donald Trump. 
Hold on, you might say. Why does Donald Trump care who fills the governor’s office in South Dakota? Maybe he doesn’t, but history tells us he loves to make endorsements. Already for 2026 he has offered endorsements in races elsewhere for the U.S. Senate and House, state legislative races and governorships.

The News Watch poll found Trump with a 68% favorability rating among Republicans in South Dakota, a far better rating than any of the candidates likely to run in the GOP primary. Consequently, his endorsement would carry some weight. Just as it may not be too soon to poll Republicans on their choice for the next governor, it’s not too soon to handicap which candidate might have the best shot at getting a thumbs-up from Trump. 
The highest finisher in the poll was U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson with 28% followed by Gov. Larry Rhoden with 27%, Attorney General Marty Jackley with 18%, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden with 4% and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen with 2%. Hansen is the only one so far to announce that he’s running for the nomination, though there is plenty of speculation about the intentions of the others. 
Johnson, the marginal leader in the poll, also finds himself in the closest proximity to the White House. During Trump’s second term he has embraced the president’s policies, going so far as to introduce legislation that would allow Trump to purchase the Panama Canal. He’s even praised the government-cutting efforts of Elon Musk’s DOGE, while admitting that the whole thing could be handled better. 
Rhoden, like Johnson, has been full of praise for the president’s policies. Rhoden’s connection to Kristi Noem, his predecessor and Trump’s secretary of Homeland Security, may be valuable if the president chooses to endorse. However, you never know when the mercurial Trump may wake up angry. He went through three Homeland Security secretaries in his first term. While he has been supportive of the president, Rhoden has a long history in South Dakota politics that may be tainted by the current GOP philosophy that scorns bipartisanship. 
Jackley has to wonder what a life in public service has been worth politically, garnering just 18% support in the poll. Serving as attorney general twice and running for governor once before has to be worth more than that. Jackley, too, has ingratiated himself to Trump, going so far as to visit Mar-a-Lago to consult with the president-elect on the politicization of the Justice Department. Known for his law and order stance in South Dakota, it must be galling for Jackley to consider the blanket pardons Trump handed out to the Jan. 6 insurrectionists.

At the bottom of the poll is the only official candidate, state Rep. Jon Hansen of Dell Rapids. His low finish in the poll is an indication that hard work in the Legislature doesn’t necessarily result in name recognition within the party. Fortunately for Hansen, he has another legislative session as speaker of the House in which to make his mark. A leader in the state’s anti-abortion and property rights efforts, he’ll need to drum up a Trumpian issue to keep his name in the news and enhance his chances of getting an endorsement.
Finishing ahead of Hansen in the poll was Doeden. He’s never held elective office but his influence can be felt in the Legislature. His Dakota First Action PAC helped elect a number of populist Republican candidates who had to notch primary wins against incumbents to get to Pierre. Doeden is known for his prolific videos that often point out what’s wrong with the members of his own party. He has something brewing, announcing an event for May 28. 
Of all these candidates, Doeden is the most Trump-like with his wealth and his disdain for the status quo. He now has a cadre of lawmakers beholden to his generosity who can carry his message to far-right members of the party. That wing of the party is known for getting out the vote during primaries.

(Tony Leys/KFF Health News)SPENCER, Iowa — This town’s hospital is a holdout on behalf of people going through mental health crises. The facility’s leaders have pledged not to shutter their inpatient psychiatric unit, as dozens of other U.S. hospitals have.
Keeping that promise could soon get tougher if Congress slashes Medicaid funding. The joint federal-state health program covers an unusually large share of mental health patients, and hospital industry leaders say spending cuts could accelerate a decades-long wave of psychiatric unit closures.
At least eight other Iowa hospitals have stopped offering inpatient mental health care since 2007, forcing people in crisis to seek help in distant facilities. Spencer Hospital is one of the smallest in Iowa still offering the service.
CEO Brenda Tiefenthaler said 40% of her hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are covered by Medicaid, compared with about 12% of all inpatients. An additional 10% of the hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are uninsured. National experts say such disparities are common.
Tiefenthaler vows to keep her nonprofit hospital’s 14-bed psychiatric unit open, even though it loses $2 million per year. That’s a significant loss for an organization with an overall annual budget of about $120 million. But the people who use the psychiatric unit need medical care, “just like people who have chest pains,” Tiefenthaler said.
Medicaid covers health care for about 72 million Americans with low incomes or disabilities. Tiefenthaler predicts that if some of them are kicked off the program and left without insurance coverage, more people would delay treatment for mental health problems until their lives spin out of control.
“Then they’re going to enter through the emergency room when they’re in a crisis,” she said. “That’s not really a solution to what we have going on in our country.”
Republican congressional leaders have vowed to protect Medicaid for people who need it, but they also have called for billions of dollars in cuts to areas of the federal budget that include the program.
The U.S. already faces a deep shortage of inpatient mental health services, many of which were reduced or eliminated by private hospitals and public institutions, said Jennifer Snow, director of government relations and policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. At the same time, the number of people experiencing mental problems has climbed.
“I don’t even want to think about how much worse it could get,” she said.
The American Hospital Association estimates nearly 100 U.S. hospitals have shuttered their inpatient mental health services in the past decade.
Such closures are often attributed to mental health services being more likely to lose money than many other types of health care.
“I’m not blaming the hospitals,” Snow said. “They need to keep their doors open.”
Medicaid generally pays hospitals lower rates for services than they receive from private insurance or from Medicare, the federal program that mostly covers people 65 or older. And Medicaid recipients are particularly likely to need mental health care. More than a third of nonelderly Medicaid enrollees have some sort of mental illness, according to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization that includes KFF Health News. Iowa has the highest rate of mental illness among nonelderly Medicaid recipients, at 51%.
As of February, just 20 of Iowa’s 116 community hospitals had inpatient psychiatric units, according to a state registry. Iowa also has four freestanding mental hospitals, including two run by the state.
Iowa, with 3.2 million residents, has a total of about 760 inpatient mental health beds that are staffed to care for patients, the state reports. The Treatment Advocacy Center, a national group seeking improved mental health care, says the “absolute minimum” of such beds would translate to about 960 for Iowa’s population, and the optimal number would be about 1,920.
Most of Iowa’s psychiatric beds are in metro areas, and it can take several days for a slot to come open. In the meantime, patients routinely wait in emergency departments.
Sheriff’s deputies often are assigned to transport patients to available facilities when treatment is court-ordered.
“It’s not uncommon for us to drive five or six hours,” said Clay County Sheriff Chris Raveling, whose northwestern Iowa county includes Spencer, a city of 11,000 people.
He said Spencer Hospital’s mental health unit often is too full to accept new patients and, like many such facilities, it declines to take patients who are violent or charged with crimes.
The result is that people are held in jail on minor charges stemming from their mental illnesses or addictions, the sheriff said.
“They really shouldn’t be in jail,” he said. “Did they commit a crime? Yes. But I don’t think they did it on purpose.”
Raveling said authorities in many cases decide to hold people in jail so they don’t hurt themselves or others while awaiting treatment. He has seen the problems worsen in his 25 years in law enforcement.
Most people with mental health issues can be treated as outpatients, but many of those services also depend heavily on Medicaid and could be vulnerable to budget cuts.
Jon Ulven, a psychologist who practices in Moorhead, Minnesota, and neighboring Fargo, North Dakota, said he’s particularly worried about patients who develop psychosis, which often begins in the teenage years or early adulthood. If they’re started right away on medication and therapy, “we can have a dramatic influence on that person for the rest of their life,” he said. But if treatment is delayed, their symptoms often become harder to reverse.
Ulven, who helps oversee mental health services in his region for the multistate Sanford Health system, said he’s also concerned about people with other mental health challenges, including depression. He noted a study published in 2022 that showed suicide rates rose faster in states that declined to expand their Medicaid programs than in states that agreed to expand their programs to cover more low-income adults. If Medicaid rolls are reduced again, he said, more people would be uninsured and fewer services would be available. That could lead to more suicides.
Nationally, Medicaid covered nearly 41% of psychiatric inpatients cared for in 2024 by a sample of 680 hospitals, according to an analysis done for KFF Health News by the financial consulting company Strata. In contrast, just 13% of inpatients in those hospitals’ cancer programs and 9% of inpatients in their cardiac programs were covered by Medicaid.
If Medicaid participants have mental crises after losing their coverage, hospitals or clinics would have to treat many of them for little or no payment.
“These are not wealthy people. They don’t have a lot of assets,” said Steve Wasson, Strata’s chief data and intelligence officer. Even though Medicaid pays hospitals relatively low rates, he said, “it’s better than nothing.”
Birthing units, which also have been plagued by closures, face similar challenges. In the Strata sample, 37% of those units’ patients were on Medicaid in 2024.
Spencer Hospital, which has a total of 63 inpatient beds, has maintained both its birthing unit and its psychiatric unit, and its leaders plan to keep them open. Amid a critical shortage of mental health professionals, it employs two psychiatric nurse practitioners and two psychiatrists, including one providing care via video from North Carolina.
Local resident David Jacobsen appreciates the hospital’s efforts to preserve services. His son Alex was assisted by the facility’s mental health professionals during years of struggles before he died by suicide in 2020.
David Jacobsen knows how reliant such services are on Medicaid, and he worries that more hospitals will curtail mental health offerings if national leaders cut the program.
“They’re hurting the people who need help the most,” he said.
People on Medicaid aren’t the only ones affected when hospitals reduce services or close treatment units. Everyone in the community loses access to care.
Alex Jacobsen’s family saw how common the need is. “If we can learn anything from my Alex,” one of his sisters wrote in his obituary, “it’s that mental illness is real, it doesn’t discriminate, and it takes some of the best people down in its ugly swirling drain.”

(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”

For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.

Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”

David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.











States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

(U.S. Department of Agriculture)Kirk Pearson, a former longtime Washington state lawmaker, was appointed this month as a top Washington official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Pearson, a Republican, resigned from the Legislature in 2017 to take the same role as Washington’s rural development director in the first Trump administration.
He couldn’t be reached for an interview. A spokesperson for the USDA said via email that the “Office of Communications is not approving individual media interviews while they coordinate messaging during this transition period.”
“I look forward to working closely with local leaders, Native American Tribes, farmers, small businesses, and families to expand opportunity and deliver the resources they need to thrive,” Pearson said in a press release. “Our mission is clear: to support rural America with solutions that are locally driven and nationally backed.”
Pearson, of Monroe, represented the 39th Legislative District in Snohomish, Skagit and King counties. He was in the House for a dozen years before serving from 2013 to 2017 in the state Senate. At the time, his departure briefly left a 24-24 balance of power in the chamber.
Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley, later replaced Pearson in the Legislature.
Before his resignation, Pearson chaired the Senate Natural Resources and Parks Committee and also served on the Agriculture, Water, Trade and Economic Development Committee.
Between his stints at USDA, he was the vice president of external affairs for the Volunteers of America Western Washington.
Pearson was one of many new state rural development directors that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins appointed this month.
“When America’s farming communities prosper, the entire nation thrives,” Rollins said in the release. “This new group of USDA appointees will ensure President Trump’s America First agenda is a reality in rural areas across the country. I am grateful for the leadership of these new state directors and look forward to their work reorienting the agency to put Farmers First again.”
Rollins also reappointed Jon Wyss as the Washington state executive director of the Farm Service Agency. President Donald Trump first tapped Wyss for the role in 2019. Then-President Joe Biden also picked him in 2022.
In a statement, U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, said “Washington farmers are lucky to have him charting the course at FSA.”
Wyss ran unsuccessfully for state Senate in 2016 in central Washington’s 12th Legislative District, losing to a fellow Republican. Over a decade earlier, he served in the Senate for a few days while the sitting senator had to briefly leave his duties.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WA_Kirk_Pearson_Oath_002_050525-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-05-17 09:02:00.449643

In Brown v. Board of Education and Bolling v. Sharpe, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the “separate but equal” doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson was unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed equal treatment under the law. 
The historic decision brought an end to federal tolerance of racial segregation, ruling in the case of student Linda Brown, who was denied admission to her local elementary school in Topeka, Kansas, because of the color of her skin.

(Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.

With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.
The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
Legislation and pilot programs
A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
Potential savings
In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

The post Grand Teton ultra-runner to fight switchback-cutting charges in Jackson trial appeared first on WyoFile .","The trail runner ticketed by Grand Teton National Park rangers for cutting a switchback during his fastest-ever out-and-back climb of the Grand Teton heads to court Tuesday to challenge the charges in a bench trial. 
It is the latest fallout over Michelino Sunseri’s decision to follow what he said is an oft-used and recognized route during his descent of the iconic peak. 
The ultra-runner and Jackson bartender rose to infamy in the outdoor world last fall in a dizzying sequence of events. On Sept. 2, Sunseri ran and scrambled the 13.2 miles from the Lupine Meadows parking lot to the summit of the 13,775-foot Grand Teton and back with a time of 2:50:50 — a stunning feat that broke a 12-year-old record. 
But on his way down the mountain, he cut a switchback while following the route of other previous record holders. Fastest Known Time — the organization that arbitrates and tracks official speed attempts — rejected his submission due to the offense. Not long after, national park rangers issued him a citation.

Pictures of Michelino Sunseri posted on a change.org petition pleading for authorities to drop the charges against the athlete. (Screengrab) 
Rangers gave Sunseri a ticket for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation comes with a penalty of $5,000 and/or up to six months in jail. 
When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor guilty plea, five-year ban from the national park and fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges.
The bench trial is scheduled to take place in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson. The high-elevation incident has stirred a lot of debate about appropriate behavior for trail users and appropriate penalties for infractions, and the trial is expected to be closely watched. 
Made an example?
Sunseri, an elite athlete with several record-breaking backcountry feats to his name, trained intensely through the summer with the goal of breaking the speed record that ultra-runner Andy Anderson set in 2012. North Face-sponsored Sunseri had done much preparation, including assembling a small team of photographers to film the attempt. 
Late-August snow complicated his weather window, and Sunseri set out on Labor Day, a federal holiday that can see crowded trails conditions not ideal for a speed attempt. After racing up the peak, he was behind Anderson’s pace and cut a switchback on the way down to avoid a line of hikers. Anderson, an off-duty climbing ranger at the time of his 2012 record, did not use the shortcut. 
Sunseri was open about his decision to cut the switchback in a post he wrote on the personal speed-tracking website Strava, adding that “if I had to make this choice again, I would 100% make the exact same choice.” 
The choice drew disapproval from some fellow runners and outdoor recreation figures, however, and was the reason FKT cited when it declined to recognize Sunseri’s record. 
FKT didn’t add Sunseri’s name to the top of its Grand Teton page, but it did update the page after his climb with a new bold-faced note: “The National Park Service has emphasized that cutting switchbacks on this route is a violation of the park service regulation 36 CFR 2.1(b) … Any future attempts to cut switchbacks will result in complete rejection, and the NPS intends to pursue criminal charges against athletes who engage in this behavior.”
Not long after that, in October, park rangers cited Sunseri with a federal misdemeanor. 
“Shortcutting a switchback along a trail is prohibited in the park because it causes resource impacts, like trampling vegetation, creating erosion and worsening trail conditions,” Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis told WyoFile.

Sunseri and his defenders were quick to point to the routes of previous record holders Kílian Jornet and Jen Day Denton, both recognized by FKT. “My route retraced their exact steps for what I knew to be an accepted course to achieve a new speed record,” Sunseri said in a September statement emailed to WyoFile. There are also more blatant examples of off-trail travel for which the park doesn’t have such a heavy hand, supporters say. 
Those supporters have created stickers, t-shirts and music videos under the label #freemichelino as well as a change.org petition with more than 2,000 signatures. The plea bargain offered to Sunseri is unreasonable, according to the petition’s web page. 
As a professional mountain runner, a five-year ban would force Sunseri to move away from a place where he makes his living, they argue. “To him, the six months in jail threatened by the GTNP Spokesperson is more palatable, though entirely unacceptable,” the page reads, adding that “a misdemeanor on his record carries a variety of collateral consequences, impacting employment, housing and international travel.”
Sunseri’s team cited insufficient evidence of a valid closure, selective enforcement, inadequate notice and unconstitutional delegation of legislative power when it asked for charges to be dismissed, according to court documents, 
Sunseri’s lawyers also asked for a jury trial, in which a panel of his peers would have determined the outcome. However, that request was not granted and instead, Judge Stephanie Hambrick will preside over a bench trial in which she will make the determination. 
A message to users 
While Sunseri supporters have framed the situation as a high-profile opportunity to make an example of someone, others consider it a high-profile opportunity to positively influence the public. 
David Gonzales, a writer, filmmaker and creator of the Jackson-based triathlon known as the Picnic, made a video analysis of the situation he posted on Instagram.

Sunseri took the shortcut knowing the park service had closed off the route, Gonzales said. Before the speed attempt, Sunseri “did a lap on the ground with Andy Anderson, and they didn’t use the shortcut, so it seems like he was aware of the park’s rules.”
Instead, Gonzales said, evidence seems to show Sunseri’s route decision was premeditated with full knowledge of the closure. 
“It does seem insane that Michelino could go to jail for taking a shortcut that hundreds, if not thousands of people have taken before him, but the park could very well make an example of him,” Gonzales said, adding that future users should heed a simple message. 
“So this summer in Grand Teton National Park, don’t take the shortcut,” Gonzales said.

Mayor Mike Duggan is preparing to leave office after 11 years at the end of 2025. The city’s next leader will inherit not only a revitalizing downtown but also neighborhoods like Belmont, Petosky-Otsego and Van Steuban that are grappling with housing instability and decades of neglect and disinvestment.
My research on housing insecurity, homelessness and urban governance, along with broader scholarship on equitable development, suggests that Detroit’s future depends on more than marquee developments like the Michigan Central Station Development. It depends on strengthening neighborhoods from the ground up. 
Here are three strategies that could help Detroit’s next mayor build a just and resilient city by focusing on transitional neighborhoods:
 Stabilize housing and prevent displacement

Stable housing is the foundation of thriving communities.
Yet, housing instability in Detroit is both widespread and deeply entrenched. Before the pandemic, roughly 13% of Detroiters, or about 88,000 people, had been evicted or forced to move within the previous year. Families with children faced the highest risk.
Many Detroiters had little choice but to remain in deteriorating housing, crowd into shared living arrangements or relocate elsewhere because of an estimated shortfall of 24,000 habitable housing units.
While building more housing is essential, preventing displacement requires more than new construction. It also demands policies that preserve affordability and protect tenants. Researchers have found that household stabilization policies, such as legal representation in eviction court, rent control and property tax relief, have the most immediate impact.
In Detroit, addressing the wave of expiring Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, units remains an urgent priority. When units reach the end of their compliance period in this federal program, typically 15 years, owners are no longer required to maintain affordable rents and can raise prices. This “conversion to market rate” often results in the loss of affordable housing for low-income residents.
In response to a projected loss of 10,000 units by 2023, Detroit launched the Preservation Partnership that secured affordability commitments for about 4,000 units. However, it remains difficult to determine exactly how many of the at-risk units were ultimately lost, and when, due to reporting lags, inconsistencies and overlapping affordability programs.
Despite the city’s efforts, a 2023 analysis found that a substantial affordability gap persists, with many households unable to comfortably afford market-rate housing without spending more than 30% of their income, which is the standard set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for affordability.
The Michigan State Housing Development Authority continues to support affordable housing through tax credit allocations. However, a growing number of LIHTC properties in areas experiencing redevelopment are reaching the end of their affordability periods, putting them at risk of converting to market rate. National estimates suggest that nearly 350,000 units could lose affordability by 2030 and over 1 million by 2040 without sustained local and regional preservation efforts.
Stabilizing Detroit’s housing market means ensuring that those who stayed during the hardest times are not pushed out as reinvestment takes hold. To achieve this, the next mayor could expand rental assistance and support tenant organizing efforts. This is particularly needed in transitional neighborhoods where renters come together to fight unfair evictions, improve housing conditions and push for more stable rents.
 Reclaim and reimagine vacant land for community benefit

Many view Detroit’s vast tracks of vacant land, estimated in the hundreds of thousands of parcels, as blight. But they could also be seen as a public asset and a generational opportunity if brought together with the right public strategies.
Land trusts can turn empty lots into valuable neighborhood spaces. A land trust is a nonprofit that holds land for the community and keeps housing affordable over the long term, a key to preventing displacement.
Research also shows that greening strategies can improve community health, cohesion and equity. Cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland have launched urban greening initiatives that transform vacant lots into community gardens, small parks and tree-filled spaces. Research shows that these projects can help stabilize property values and strengthen neighborhoods by reducing blight, encouraging investment and creating safer, more attractive environments.
Detroit has a land bank, a public agency that manages vacant and foreclosed properties. The city has also invested in some green infrastructure. But experts say that these efforts require stronger city leadership, teamwork across departments and real input from residents. These are areas where Detroit still has room to grow.
By collaborating with residents to cocreate a land use vision, the next mayor could prioritize community ownership and ecological restoration instead of speculative redevelopment.
 Invest in social infrastructure

Neighborhood strength is about more than buildings — it’s about people.
As the Brookings Institution notes, economic opportunity is key to long-term safety, and investing in youth is a proven violence reduction strategy.
Detroit’s neighborhoods have long faced a lack of investment in schools, recreation centers and social services. This leaves families vulnerable and fuels cycles of poverty and criminalization. Under these conditions, young people, especially Black and brown youth, are more likely to be policed, punished and pushed into the criminal justice system.
A 2021 study found that the Detroit Public Schools Community District reported 2% of its students experienced homelessness, despite 16% of households with children reporting recent eviction or forced moves. This gap reveals major service and awareness gaps. And when families fall through those gaps, it’s often children who suffer the most.
Addressing these gaps requires investing in mental health services, youth development programs and violence prevention, rather than relying solely on policing or incarceration. These approaches recognize that true public safety comes from access to stable jobs, quality education and supportive services that meet people’s health, housing and social needs. Some of the most effective strategies include restorative justice in schools and outreach to older adults and residents experiencing homelessness.
These are not luxuries. They are essential infrastructure for neighborhood vitality.
 The work ahead

Detroit is often held up as a cautionary tale of urban decline, or more recently, as a comeback story driven by downtown revitalization. But in my opinion, its true test lies in what comes next: whether the city can translate momentum into equity for the communities that have long been left behind.
The next mayor has the chance to shift the narrative by centering housing justice, reclaiming land for public good and investing in the people who make Detroit a city worth fighting for.

People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.

Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, National Disability Rights Network attorney


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)Maine’s reproductive health providers are raising alarm about the thousands of patients that would be left without care if a proposal to cut off Medicaid funding from family planning providers comes to pass.
The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees health care, approved a massive tax cut and spending bill this week, which proposes the largest cuts to Medicaid in the history of the program, and would leave more than 8 million Americans without coverage. But a part of the bill also proposes cutting off funding to any  nonprofit health care providers that offer abortions and receive more than $1 million in Medicaid funding. 
That means two of Maine’s largest family planning service providers, both of whom serve a large number of patients on MaineCare — the state’s Medicaid program — may no longer be reimbursed by the federal government for services. 
Both Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning have policies to serve patients regardless of their ability to pay, meaning they would still commit to providing services for patients, they said. 
Medicaid reimbursements are already lower than what providers receive from private insurance, which means many Maine centers, particularly those in rural areas, are already facing significant deficits. With the likely loss of a major funding stream, these providers are now confronting a fiscal cliff, according to Olivia Pennington, director of advocacy and community engagement for Maine Family Planning, the largest network providing a wide range of services including abortions across 18 centers in Maine.

“This is a clear attack on rural Mainers, on working class Mainers. Folks who otherwise may not be able to access the health centers if their local family planning clinic has to close its doors,” Pennington said.
Already, some rural health centers in Rumford, Damariscotta and Dexter can only stay open once or twice a week because of the persistent deficits these centers have been facing, she said. The targeted exclusion from Medicaid funding, which 47% of all Maine Family Planning patients used last year, further jeopardizes the services they can provide, she said.
The bill “segregates abortion providers, and cuts folks off from making us their provider of choice,” said Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for the Maine Planned Parenthood centers.
“There’s an intention to destabilize our funding streams, such that we aren’t able to fulfill our core mission, and really put us out of business,” she said.
The centers’ ability to use Medicaid or Title X, a federal grant that supports family planning services for low-income individuals, is already restricted by the Hyde Amendment, a provision prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortions that President Donald Trump reinstated at the start of his second term. 
Maine Family Planning has been subject to regular audits to make sure Medicaid funding is not used for abortion, Pennington said.
It is not clear how Maine’s congressional delegation is going to vote on the proposed health care cuts, but during a press conference Friday Planned Parenthood of Northern New England CEO Nicole Clegg said the organization expects them to reject the proposal.
“Based on their long-standing records of opposing defunding efforts of Planned Parenthood and restrictions to reproductive health providers, our expectation is that they would not support any of these proposals moving forward,” she said. 
In light of the proposed cuts, the providers are hoping the Maine Legislature can help fill the funding gap. They highlighted LD 143, a bill that would provide $6 million a year for family planning services, including routine gynecological exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control, cancer screenings, and gender-affirming and behavioral health care. 
“We really see LD 143 as essential for weathering the national storm, sort of weatherproofing our family planning care network in the midst of these potential federal defunds,” Marguiles said. “It’s really critical that the state partners with us in providing care to anyone who needs it.”
Both the Maine House and Senate cast initial votes to pass the legislation, but it was placed on the appropriations table where it will compete with many other funding needs for whatever is available as the state faces a substantial budget deficit.

(Catherine McQueen/Moment via Getty Images)In today’s digital world, people routinely turn to the internet for health or medical information. In addition to actively searching online, they often come across health-related information on social media or receive it through emails or messages from family or friends.
It can be tempting to share such messages with loved ones — often with the best of intentions.
As a global health communication scholar studying the effects of media on health and development, I explore artistic and creative ways to make health information more engaging and accessible, empowering people to make informed decisions.
Although there is a fire hose of health-related content online, not all of it is factual. In fact, much of it is inaccurate or misleading, raising a serious health communication problem: Fake health information — whether shared unknowingly and innocently, or deliberately to mislead or cause harm — can be far more captivating than accurate information.
This makes it difficult for people to know which sources to trust and which content is worthy of sharing.
 
The allure of fakery
Fake health information can take many forms. For example, it may be misleading content that distorts facts to frame an issue or individual in a certain context. Or it may be based on false connections, where headlines, visuals or captions don’t align with the content. Despite this variation, such content often shares a few common characteristics that make it seem believable and more shareable than facts.
For one thing, fake health information often appears to be true because it mixes a grain of truth with misleading claims.
For example, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, false rumors suggested that drinking ethanol or bleach could protect people from the virus. While ethanol or bleach can indeed kill viruses on surfaces such as countertops, it is extremely dangerous when it comes into contact with skin or gets inside the body.
Another marker of fake health information is that it presents ideas that are simply too good to be true. There is something appealingly counterintuitive in certain types of fake health information that can make people feel they have access to valuable or exclusive knowledge that others may not know. For example, a claim such as “chocolate helps you lose weight” can be especially appealing because it offers a sense of permission to indulge and taps into a simple, feel-good solution to a complex problem. Such information often spreads faster because it sounds both surprising and hopeful, validating what some people want to believe.
Sensationalism also drives the spread of fake health information. For instance, when critics falsely claimed that Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical adviser to the president at the time, was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, it generated a lot of public attention.
In a study on vaccine hesitancy published in 2020, my colleagues and I found that controversial headlines in news reports that go viral before national vaccination campaigns can discourage parents from getting their children vaccinated. These headlines seem to reveal sensational and secret information that can falsely boost the message’s credibility.
 
The pull to share
The internet has created fertile ground for spreading fake health information. Professional-looking websites and social media posts with misleading headlines can lure people into clicking or quickly sharing, which drives more and more readers to the falsehood. People tend to share information they believe is relevant to them or their social circles.
In 2019, an article with the false headline “Ginger is 10,000x more effective at killing cancer than chemo” was shared more than 800,000 times on Facebook. The article contained several factors that make people feel an urgency to react and share without checking the facts: compelling visuals, emotional stories, misleading graphs, quotes from experts with omitted context and outdated content that is recirculated.
Visual cues like the logos of reputable organizations or photos of people wearing white medical coats add credibility to these posts. This kind of content is highly shareable, often reaching far more people than scientifically accurate studies that may lack eye-catching headlines or visuals, easy-to-understand words or dramatic storylines.
But sharing content without verifying it first has real-world consequences. For example, studies have found that COVID-19-related fake information reduces people’s trust in the government and in health care systems, making people less likely to use or seek out health services.
Unfounded claims about vaccine side effects have led to reduced vaccination rates globally, fueling the return of dangerous diseases, including measles.

Social media misinformation, such as false claims about cinnamon being a treatment for cancer, has caused hospitalizations and even deaths. The spread of health misinformation has reduced cooperation with important prevention and treatment recommendations, prompting a growing need for medical professionals to receive proper training and develop skills to effectively debunk fake health information.
 
How to combat the spread
In today’s era of information overload, when anyone can create and share content, being able to distinguish between credible and misleading health information before sharing is more important than ever. Researchers and public health organizations have outlined several strategies to help people make better-informed decisions.
Whether health care consumers come across health information on social media, in an email or through a messaging app, here are three reliable ways to verify its accuracy and credibility before sharing:

Use a search engine to cross-check health claims. Never rely on a single source. Instead, enter the health claim into a reputable search engine like Google and see what trusted sources have to say. Prioritize information from established organizations like the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United Nations Children’s Fund or peer-reviewed journals like The Lancet or Journal of the American Medical Association. If multiple reputable sources agree, the information is more likely to be reliable. Reliable fact-checking websites such as FactCheck.org and Snopes can also help root out fake information.
Evaluate the source’s credibility. A quick way to assess a website’s trustworthiness is to check its “About Us” page. This section usually explains who is behind the content, their mission and their credentials. Also, search the name of the author. Do they have recognized expertise or affiliations with credible institutions? Reliable websites often have domains ending in .gov or .edu, indicating government or educational institutions. Finally, check the publication date. Information on the internet keeps circulating for years and may not be the most accurate or relevant in the present context.
If you’re still unsure, don’t share. If you’re still uncertain about the accuracy of a claim, it’s better to keep it to yourself. Forwarding unverified information can unintentionally contribute to the spread of misinformation and potentially cause harm, especially when it comes to health.

Questioning dubious claims and sharing only verified information not only protects against unsafe behaviors and panic, but it also helps curb the spread of fake health information. At a time when misinformation can spread faster than a virus, taking a moment to pause and fact-check can make a big difference.

Wes Moore (D) inspects damage at a library in Westernport on Thursday in the wake of flooding in Western Maryland in the previous week. (Photo by Patrick Siebert/Governor's office)The Allegany County Department of Emergency Services announced that a multiagency resource center would open Saturday in Westernport to help residents of the flood-damaged area find the help they need to recover from the week’s storms.
The resource center will alternate daily between Westernport and Lonaconing for the next week, offering walk-in help with food stamps and other benefits, senior services, health care, disaster relief, community referrals and other services.
The center opening comes two days after Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency Thursday for Allegany and Garrett counties in the wake of the sudden heavy rains earlier this week that flooded roads, inundated homes and schools, and damaged utilities.
More than 5 inches of rain fell Tuesday, causing flooding in the state’s two westernmost counties and pushing Georges Creek to its second-highest levels on record. Georges Creek rose more than 6 feet in 5.5 hours Tuesday, to 12 feet, while the North Branch of the Potomac River near Cumberland surged almost 15 feet from Tuesday afternoon to early Wednesday, reaching flood stage of 23 feet around midnight, according to the Allegany County Department of Emergency Services.
Some roads were washed out or buried and water service the town of Lonaconing was briefly suspended after a roadway washout caused pipe damage.
More than 200 students and faculty were trapped by rising waters and had to be rescued from the Westernport and George’s Creek elementary schools by area swiftwater rescue teams Tuesday afternoon and evening.

Kati Kenney, communications director for Allegany County, told WTOP radio that the focus on Tuesday, after rescues, was on damage assessment and assuring the safety of residents in the community. She said the town of Westernport was hit hardest.
“The majority, if not all of those structures, have severe water damage and the crews there are now doing some structural assessments to figure out if they’re even safe to go back in,” Kenney said, referring to damage along the town’s Main Street.
Kenney said severe flooding is not frequent, but has happened in the past, with the most recent damaging floods occurring in 1996. “So this isn’t a first for them, but it’s been quite a few years since we’ve experienced anything quite like this,” she said.
Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th), who toured the region Thursday with Moore and other state and local officials, said that “seeing the aftermath of the flooding firsthand is overwhelming.”
“You don’t fully grasp the scale of it until you’re standing here, witnessing it for yourself,” Delaney said. “We’ve met families who had to evacuate their homes and small business owners now facing tough choices.”
Moore and Delaney were joined by Maryland secretaries of Emergency Management, Transportation and Environment, the deputy secretary of Natural Resources Police, Maryland State Police officials, Allegany County Commission President Dave Caporale and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton.
After a briefing, the delegation toured the Westernport Main Street corridor and surveyed flood damage at Westernport fire hall, library, local businesses and Westernport Elementary School. Moore issued the emergency declaration during his tour.
“This was a serious test for public safety and health, and we responded with urgency,” Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain said after the tour. “Drinking water systems were damaged, homes were flooded, and families were impacted. We acted quickly to confirm that our dams were operating correctly, offer emergency help for contaminated home heating oil tanks, and support safe debris removal.”
McIlwain said the focus now is on “long-term recovery, guiding infrastructure repairs, fast-tracking permits, and staying close to communities as they rebuild.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)They share a Metro line, they share a ZIP code and they share a dream of revitalized older communities. And, come Saturday, the Prince George’s County towns of Capitol Heights and Fairmount Heights and the city of Seat Pleasant will have something else in common.
They will all be members of the new 20743 Coalition.
The mayors of those three inside-the-Beltway municipalities will meet Saturday to launch the coalition, named for the ZIP code they have in common. Their goal is to ensure that their often-overlooked communities share in the Blue Line corridor redevelopment projects that are scheduled in coming years as part of an effort to redevelop central Prince George’s County.
Saturday’s signing ceremony is meant as a show of unity for the communities clustered along Metro’s Blue Line and the county’s Central Avenue. All three mayors already signed a memorandum of understanding in March for each municipality to share resources “that promote economic development, enhance public services, and improve residents’ quality of life.”
The Maryland Stadium Authority is slated tom invest $400 million toward five projects planned for areas near Largo Town Center, Morgan Boulevard, Addison/Seat Pleasant and Capitol Heights Metro stations. The first will be a civic plaza by the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Largo, scheduled for completion in December.
One official who plans to be in attendance at the Fairmount Heights Municipal Building for Saturday’s event will be At-Large County Councilmember Jolene Ivey (D).
“I think it’s really important that we’re all on one accord when it comes to using this as an opportunity for economic development and to really push getting good things happening in that part of the county,” she said in an interview Wednesday. “We all have to kind of agree on what that looks like.”

Officials and residents from the three municipalities located inside the Beltway have said for years there has been a lack of economic development, especially when it comes to healthy food choices.
A food desert was created in July 2016, when a Safeway closed at Addison Plaza in Seat Pleasant on Central Avenue, less than a mile from the Washington, D.C., border.
Since that time, there’s been no major food retailer on that road for the almost four miles between the D.C. border and the Capital Beltway in Capitol Heights.
A small full-service grocer called Good Food Markets and Café opened in Addison Plaza in September 202. Because of financial challenges, however, only the café remained open. a year later. The business has since closed.
To help fill some of the void, The Capital Market has hosted farmers markets and various workshops in all three municipalities. Because of the nonprofit organization’s relationship with officials and residents, it will serve as a facilitator to the coalition.
According to the agreement, Capital Market will also “provide quarterly financial reports to all Parties (municipalities) detailing the use of funds and progress on initiative to each municipality.”
“These are three majority African American municipalities … [with] a lot of shared history and culture,” said Kyle Reeder, interim administrative director with Capital Market and a sixth-generation Prince Georgian, who lives in Capitol Heights. “I’m excited to see what the municipalities are able to do together.”
So is Belinda Queen, a community activist who also lives in Capitol Heights.
But at a community meeting Wednesday night, Queen urged state lawmakers from legislative District 25, which includes the neighborhood of Walker Mill in an unincorporated part of Capitol Heights, to make sure economic development does happen.
“The Blue Line corridor is supposed to be for all of us going through Capitol Heights,” she said. “So I need you guys to stay on this.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Addison-Road-Seat-Pleasant-station-5-15-2025-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-05-16 23:58:16.473608

(Image from MassAGO livestream)Attorneys general from around New England struck a defiant posture at a town hall gathering on Friday evening. Together they pledged that nothing is off the table when it comes to holding immigration officials accountable, lauded the courts for standing firm so far, and pointed at an ever-growing pile of litigation targeting the Trump administration’s actions on everything from energy policy to anti-discrimination law.
“All of us probably have a target on our back,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said, speaking from the IBEW Local 103 union hall in Dorchester. “But we say bring it on.”
The town hall included the region’s Democratic AGs – Campbell, William Tong of Connecticut, Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, Charity Clark of Vermont, and Aaron Frey of Maine. Billed as “United in Justice,” the gathering was distinctly aimed at Trump administration policies that the group has declared will damage the region and its residents.
Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are “unlawful” and “damaging.”
“After last November’s election and the anxiety that goes with it, we all felt our fight was gonna get a little tougher, a little steeper, and our work a lot harder,” said introductory speaker Lou Antonellis, business manager of the Dorchester union and executive vice president of the building and construction trades with the Greater Boston Labor Council. “And those words ring truer and truer every day for Americans because of this administration. Unless, of course, you’re rich.”
A union member at the town hall noted the administration’s antagonism toward renewable energy options, when unions are training their members on offshore wind work. Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Boston federal court this month to block Trump’s pause on all federal wind-energy approvals.
Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad. Gov. Maura Healey made a national name for herself as attorney general by, like her successor Campbell, taking an aggressive stance toward the first Trump presidency. Her office sued the administration nearly 100 times, while Campbell has filed more than a dozen suits against the administration in the first 100 days of the new Trump term.
State law enforcement officials are in a tricky spot when it comes to defending against some federal policies, the attorneys general noted, especially around immigration. Multiple attendees asked what the state can do to push back on what one described as an “autocratic police state.”
There is significant federal authority to enforce and create immigration policies, placing the attorneys general in “uncharted territory” in figuring out how to wield state power against federal actors.
The offices are putting out guidance for individuals and organizations, fighting against policy changes that would claw back immigration protections like Temporary Protected Status, connecting people with lawyers, and reminding law enforcement that it does not need to enable Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Campbell spoke complimentarily of the decision by Worcester’s police chief to request that charges be dropped against the distraught 16-year-old daughter of a woman arrested in an ICE incident that has drawn intense backlash.
But “nothing is off the table” when it comes to pushing back on ICE oversteps, she said.
“If the US attorney can threaten us about us getting in the way of these policies and immigration enforcement, well guess what? We can bring it back,” Campbell said, adding slyly, “in a collaborative and loving way.”
Neronha, of Rhode Island, said withholding cooperation to federal agents looking to “commandeer” state law enforcement could be a serious impediment to ICE efforts.
He also laid out how he sees the administration’s playbook in general: bypass congressional power of the purse, strip allocated taxpayer dollars from essential programs or make sweeping declarations on constitutional matters, and challenge the legitimacy of district courts when they issue nationwide injunctions blocking the president’s actions.
“What we’re dealing with here, in my view, is a creeping authoritarianism,” he said. “And it’s not really creeping, is it?” To constituents who are looking for hope, he asked that they remember “every day there are lawyers who get up in the morning, like my colleagues here and all across the country in Democratic states, and fight for you. We are your lawyers. We are fighting for you, and we are winning.”
The latest legal volley from a collective of Democratic attorneys general – including the five New England AGs participating in the town hall – challenges a federal threat to withhold billions of dollars in transportation and disaster-relief funds unless states agree to cooperate with certain immigration enforcement actions.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an emailed statement to Axios that no funding has been withheld.
New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who was elected president of The National Association of Attorneys General in December and has not joined attorney general coalitions suing the Trump administration during this second term, is the only Republican attorney general in New England and was the only regional AG not present. A spokesperson said Formella had a full schedule for New Hampshire law enforcement memorial day, but the spokesman was not aware of Friday night’s town hall.
As attorney general of the most conservative New England state – though it narrowly voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election – Formella’s office does not always split along partisan lines. He joined other Republican attorneys general in suits against former President Joe Biden, such as a volley against a vaccination-testing mandate, but also brought a civil rights lawsuit in 2024 against members of the neo-Nazi group Nationalist Social Club-131 who allegedly harassed a Concord cafe hosting drag story hours.
The day before the town hall, Campbell and Tong joined Democratic attorneys general from New Jersey, Washington, and California after U.S. Supreme Court arguments on Trump’s executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who enter the U.S. illegally or on a temporary visa.
Tong noted on Friday that so far the “courts are holding,” but some of the voices in the current administration are still talking about potentially “de-naturalizing” American citizens like his parents, Tong said.
The case currently before the nation’s high court is ostensibly about whether lower court judges can issue injunctions halting presidential executive orders nationwide – rather than only applying to a specific set of plaintiffs who bring suits inside specific jurisdictions – but justices toyed with whether they should consider the underlying merits of the birthright citizenship suit as well.
“I think what’s most important is not just the limited argument today,” Campbell said. “It’s that everyone should care about this birthright citizenship issue. It is not just about the access to citizenship and the privileges afforded by citizenship. If they can dismantle the 14th Amendment in our Constitution, they can also dismantle the other rights and privileges afforded our residents.”
The president took to his social media platform, Truth Social, after the arguments before the Supreme Court.
“The Radical Left SleazeBags, which has no cards remaining in its illegal bag of tricks, is, in a very coordinated manner, PLAYING THE REF with regard to the United States Supreme Court,” he posted. “They lost the Election in a landslide, and with it, have totally lost their confidence and reason. They are stone cold CRAZY! I hope the Supreme Court doesn’t fall for the games they play. The people are with us in bigger numbers than ever before. They want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”
Trump continued lashing out throughout Friday after the U.S. Supreme Court maintained a block on his deportations under wartime law.
The U.S. government is ultimately “an honor system,” Tong said, constructed of people bound together by belief and commitment to democratic principles. No higher power is going to force Trump to comply with the rule of law, but the country is too diverse and decentralized to be “swallowed whole” by any one administration, he added
“Be as noisy and chaotic and boisterous as we can be,” he said, “in every state and every jurisdiction, and make it hard for them every step of the way.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House voted to advance a bill that would establish a statewide tracking system for sexual assault examination kits, expedite processing times, and ensure that survivors can privately monitor the status of their own kit. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed the legislation, House Bill 62, and the House passed the bill on Friday with a vote of 39 to 0. One member, Rep. Rebecca Schwanke, R-Glennallen, was absent.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage and chair of the House Judiciary Committee spoke in support of the bill on the House floor on Friday. 
“House Bill 62 is a vital step toward strengthening Alaska’s response to sexual assault,” he said. “Currently, there’s no legally required timeline for when health care providers must notify law enforcement after completing a kit. House Bill 62 corrects this.”
If passed, the legislation would set more expedient timelines for processing sexual assault examination kits, which is a collection of physical evidence that can be used in criminal prosecution. Health care providers would have to notify law enforcement that a kit is ready for forensic testing within 14 days. The law enforcement agency would then have to submit the kit for forensic testing also within 14 days, down from 30 days. The lab would have to test the kit within 120 days, down from 180 days or six months.
Alaska law enforcement has made major progress on a statewide backlog in testing sexual assault examination kits in recent years, and Gray urged support for the bill to continue that positive trend. “Supported by advocacy groups, medical professionals and public safety officials, this bill is the result of a statewide collaboration,” he said. “With the backlog of untested kits now behind us, House Bill 62 ensures that we never have a backlog again.”
The legislation would also create a tracking system for survivors to privately monitor their own forensic kit through the testing process. David Kanaris, chief of the scientific crime detection laboratory in the Department of Public Safety testified before lawmakers in February that this was a major priority for the department.  
“Doing this previously had to be done through them contacting a law enforcement agency,” he said of kit tracking. “Which can be a traumatic experience in itself for the victim-survivor, and so allowing them to do it at their own pace through the kit tracking system was huge for us.”
The state already has a tracking system in place, supported by grant funding, according to the department, and the bill would provide that the state maintain the system, at an estimated cost of $200,000 per year.
With just five days left in the legislative session, the Alaska Senate is likely to take up the bill next year.

(Photo by Russ Taylor/National Park Service)As a fourth-generation sockeye salmon fisherman, I have my own reasons for disliking farmed fish. I started fishing with my family in Bristol Bay in 1979 on my great-grandfather’s site. That was the first year independent fishermen were paid $1 per pound for their salmon. The price increased for several years and then declined drastically when the farming of Atlantic salmon grew to an industrial scale in Norway and Chile, flooding the salmon market. Small-boat salmon fishermen found themselves bargaining for pennies per pound. Forty years later, it is not uncommon for us to be paid a base price less than a dollar per pound, with no adjustment for inflation. 
Despite how harmful industrial-scale finfish aquaculture has been for fishing families like mine, we are seeing efforts to expand it, at federal and state levels. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s bill to introduce inland finfish farming to Alaska threatens our wild seafood’s reputation. To keep finfish aquaculture at bay outside of state waters, the federal Keep Finfish Free Act of 2025, S.1529, provides a ray of hope. KFFA would block federal agencies from authorizing industrial fish farms in federally managed U.S. waters without congressional approval. This bill, first championed by the late Rep. Don Young, was just reintroduced by our own Sen. Dan Sullivan, along with Sen. Cory Booker. Note that KFFA would not deter beneficial forms of aquaculture, such as oyster and kelp farming; oysters filter water and kelp sequesters carbon.
Beyond finfish farming impacting the livelihoods of small-boat fishermen who feed the world, there are many reasons to be concerned. Ocean health is a big consideration: Large-scale finfish farms create oxygen-starved dead zones from fish waste that piles up. Net pens create conditions for disease that spread to wild fish. Antibiotics and antiparasitics, required to keep stocks from dying in crowded pens, flow freely into open water, contaminating ecosystems. They also end up in the farmed fish brought to market, ingested by consumers who think it’s as nutritious as wild fish. Dyes are added to feed to give the flesh of farmed salmon the color and appearance of wild salmon. And farmed fish consume vast amounts of feed made of wild fish, a practice that is depleting fish stocks and fueling global food insecurity.
The Keep Finfish Free Act helps preserve the proud legacy of Alaska’s wild seafood. It is an encouraging reflection of Sen. Sullivan’s appraisal and support of our state’s seafood sector. Perhaps a House companion bill will be taken up by our freshman legacy lawmaker Congressman Nick Begich, whose grandfather preceded Rep. Young in the same office. At the same time, Gov. Dunleavy’s bill to introduce finfish farming to Alaska concerns me as an Alaskan and fisherman alike. The touting of onshore recirculating aquaculture systems does not allay my fears of what could happen to our seafood industry. Lifting our 1990 finfish farm ban would open the door for fish farms to be built anywhere in our state — onshore or offshore, and harm our cherished salmon populations.
The words “wild,” “natural” and “sustainable” will hold no meaning to the Alaska seafood brand if finfish aquaculture is developed here. There is endless room for innovation with fish that are already available in our waters — and these fish grow themselves. Building local processing infrastructure, improving distribution routes, innovating products, and creating new markets could answer food security needs in our state and feed our own people. That includes full utilization of each fish — rather than wastefully discarding parts that aren’t neatly cut into fillets.
As a delegate to the World Forum of Fisher Peoples, I’ve spoken to enough small-scale and Indigenous fishermen from other parts of the world to learn that small-boat fleets are being pushed out of fishing grounds by industrial fish farms globally. And, this is not just about farmed versus wild seafood, the problem is one of scale across both aquaculture and wild capture fisheries. Around the world, large-scale commercial fishing operations catch enormous amounts of nontarget species, causing ecosystems and people to suffer. We cannot industrialize ourselves out of these problems.
The Alaska Senate and House versions of the finfish farming bills, Senate Bill 108 and House Bill 111, are alive in committees. The newly reintroduced Keep Finfish Free Act in the U.S. Senate, along with a potential companion bill sponsored by Congressman Begich, could create a positive balance and continue to protect our wild fish populations and the communities that depend on them from the harms of industrial aquaculture. Take the time to think about where you want your food to come from: a net pen of fish laden with antibiotics, pesticides, and dyes, or a small boat run by a family-owned fishing business.

Supplementing my teacher pay is helpful but my main reason for tutoring is to help struggling students to success.  This starts with being able to read.

I am troubled by the governor’s intention to cut the tutoring program for literacy and numeracy tutoring in favor of providing private school vouchers.

Whilst there may be some benefits to providing some students with vouchers to attend private schools, teaching a child to read– and therefore to be able to engage with the curriculum – should remain a top priority.

Louisiana went from being ranked 49th to 32nd in five years. I believe the tutoring program is a contributing factor to this success.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Rep. David Eastman lost his bid for reelection last November, but the Wasilla Republican’s legacy is still affecting the Alaska Legislature.
On Friday, the Legislature passed four bills that are attempts to redo legislation that passed the Capitol last year. The redo was encouraged by a lawsuit filed by Eastman against the Legislature in November. 
At the end of last year’s legislative session, lawmakers combined multiple bills — dealing with child care, state boards and hunting guide changes — in an effort to get them passed before the session’s constitutional deadline.
Legislative attorneys and even some legislators said at the time that the combination would be a violation of Article II, Section 13, of the Alaska Constitution, which says that “every bill shall be confined to one subject unless it is an appropriation bill or one codifying, revising, or rearranging existing laws.”
Eastman cites that section of the constitution in his lawsuit. With the suit moving forward, thus raising questions about the legality of the policies within the contested bill, legislators reintroduced each of the contested bills separately when the Legislature reconvened in January.
One of the bills creates a concession program for hunting guides, allowing the state to more tightly regulate the big-game hunting industry in Alaska. Two others are intended to help Alaska’s child care shortage, one by offering additional tax credits to companies that offer child care for their employees.
Each of the bills started in the Senate, and each passed the House on Friday, all by wide margins.
Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, called the redo “part of doing business” in the Capitol.
Last year’s state House was led by a predominantly Republican coalition majority. This year’s House is led by a predominantly Democratic coalition. Lawmakers traditionally feel pressure to finish their work before the end of the second year of the session and adjournment “sine die,” or without a fixed date to return.
“Being able to roll bills together on the sine die session can be a valuable tool, but I know at times it’s misused, which on occasion it is, (and) it can be a real sort of nuisance,” Edgmon said. “So I think more legislators support having that tool available if it’s used sparingly and sort of judiciously. But there are some who think that it’s not a necessary tool. So it’s been interesting to see that sort of juxtaposition.”
House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, said he feels good that all of the needed bills passed “unscathed.”
By phone, Eastman said that he doesn’t disagree with the policies in last year’s bill, but he does worry about the process and is concerned that lawmakers could be doing things in a way that the constitution’s framers didn’t intend.
Even though replacement bills have passed, the lawsuit should continue, he said, in order to prevent future legislatures from trying to repeat what happened last year.
“It’s not about whether I liked (the policies in the bill) or didn’t like them politically. It’s about whether or not we’re going to create a new normal where you can put any kind of things into a bill you want from whatever source, topic or subject matter, and you can just call it good,” he said.
Eastman said the Legislature’s actions last year raised a question that still isn’t resolved: “Are we going to build on that in the future and start a new direction, or are we going to go back to more the way that we’ve done things in the past? I hope that we go back to the way we’ve done things in the past.”
Attorney Joe Geldhof is representing Eastman in court.
“I’m glad it appears the Legislature enacted things according to the Constitution. This doesn’t end the case. David Eastman wants, David Eastman deserves, and I’ll try to get a declaration that what the Alaska Legislature did last year was unconstitutional,” Geldhof said by phone.
While the multi-subject legislation was aimed at wrapping up work before the end of the last day of the 2024 session, the House still passed five bills after midnight on that day. Gov. Mike Dunleavy later vetoed them, saying that they missed the deadline.
All five have been either re-introduced or introduced as part of a broader bill, and each of the five has either passed the Legislature or is on track to do so.
Eastman’s lawsuit and the resulting legislative process are likely to change the Capitol, Kopp said. “I think that there is going to be more of a concerted effort, not only with the single-subject rule, but also with the timing of passage of bills, not letting things get stacked up against midnight.”

Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are ""unlawful"" and “damaging.” 
The post New England AGs to Trump: ‘Bring i[...]","ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM around New England struck a defiant posture at a town hall gathering on Friday evening. Together they pledged that nothing is off the table when it comes to holding immigration officials accountable, lauded the courts for standing firm so far, and pointed at an ever-growing pile of litigation targeting the Trump administration’s actions on everything from energy policy to anti-discrimination law. “All of us probably have a target on our back,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said, speaking from the IBEW Local 103 union hall in Dorchester. “But we say bring it on.” The town hall included the region’s Democratic AGs – Campbell, William Tong of Connecticut, Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, Charity Clark of Vermont, and Aaron Frey of Maine. Billed as “United in Justice,” the gathering was distinctly aimed at Trump administration policies that the group has declared will damage the region and its residents.  Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are “unlawful” and “damaging.” “After last November’s election and the anxiety that goes with it, we all felt our fight was gonna get a little tougher, a little steeper, and our work a lot harder,” said introductory speaker Lou Antonellis, business manager of the Dorchester union and executive vice president of the building and construction trades with the Greater Boston Labor Council. “And those words ring truer and truer every day for Americans because of this administration. Unless, of course, you’re rich.” A union member at the town hall noted the administration’s antagonism toward renewable energy options, when unions are training their members on offshore wind work. Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Boston federal court this month to block Trump’s pause on all federal wind-energy approvals. Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad. Gov. Maura Healey made a national name for herself as attorney general by, like her successor Campbell, taking an aggressive stance toward the first Trump presidency. Her office sued the administration nearly 100 times, while Campbell has filed more than a dozen suits against the administration in the first 100 days of the new Trump term. State law enforcement officials are in a tricky spot when it comes to defending against some federal policies, the attorneys general noted, especially around immigration. Multiple attendees asked what the state can do to push back on what one described as an “autocratic police state.”  There is significant federal authority to enforce and create immigration policies, placing the attorneys general in “uncharted territory” in figuring out how to wield state power against federal actors.  The offices are putting out guidance for individuals and organizations, fighting against policy changes that would claw back immigration protections like Temporary Protected Status, connecting people with lawyers, and reminding law enforcement that it does not need to enable Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Campbell spoke complimentarily of the decision by Worcester’s police chief to request that charges be dropped against the distraught 16-year-old daughter of a woman arrested in an ICE incident that has drawn intense backlash. But “nothing is off the table” when it comes to pushing back on ICE oversteps, she said. “If the US attorney can threaten us about us getting in the way of these policies and immigration enforcement, well guess what? We can bring it back,” Campbell said, adding slyly, “in a collaborative and loving way.” Neronha, of Rhode Island, said withholding cooperation to federal agents looking to “commandeer” state law enforcement could be a serious impediment to ICE efforts.  He also laid out how he sees the administration’s playbook in general: bypass congressional power of the purse, strip allocated taxpayer dollars from essential programs or make sweeping declarations on constitutional matters, and challenge the legitimacy of district courts when they issue nationwide injunctions blocking the president’s actions. “What we’re dealing with here, in my view, is a creeping authoritarianism,” he said. “And it’s not really creeping, is it?” To constituents who are looking for hope, he asked that they remember “every day there are lawyers who get up in the morning, like my colleagues here and all across the country in Democratic states, and fight for you. We are your lawyers. We are fighting for you, and we are winning.” The latest legal volley from a collective of Democratic attorneys general – including the five New England AGs participating in the town hall – challenges a federal threat to withhold billions of dollars in transportation and disaster-relief funds unless states agree to cooperate with certain immigration enforcement actions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an emailed statement to Axios that no funding has been withheld. New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who was elected president of The National Association of Attorneys General in December and has not joined attorney general coalitions suing the Trump administration during this second term, is the only Republican attorney general in New England and was the only regional AG not present. A spokesperson said Formella had a full schedule for New Hampshire law enforcement memorial day, but the spokesman was not aware of Friday night’s town hall.  As attorney general of the most conservative New England state – though it narrowly voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election – Formella’s office does not always split along partisan lines. He joined other Republican attorneys general in suits against former President Joe Biden, such as a volley against a vaccination-testing mandate, but also brought a civil rights lawsuit in 2024 against members of the neo-Nazi group Nationalist Social Club-131 who allegedly harassed a Concord cafe hosting drag story hours. The day before the town hall, Campbell and Tong joined Democratic attorneys general from New Jersey, Washington, and California after US Supreme Court arguments on Trump’s executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who enter the US illegally or on a temporary visa.  Tong noted on Friday that so far the “courts are holding,” but some of the voices in the current administration are still talking about potentially “de-naturalizing” American citizens like his parents, Tong said. The case currently before the nation’s high court is ostensibly about whether lower court judges can issue injunctions halting presidential executive orders nationwide – rather than only applying to a specific set of plaintiffs who bring suits inside specific jurisdictions – but justices toyed with whether they should consider the underlying merits of the birthright citizenship suit as well. “I think what’s most important is not just the limited argument today,” Campbell said. “It’s that everyone should care about this birthright citizenship issue. It is not just about the access to citizenship and the privileges afforded by citizenship. If they can dismantle the 14th Amendment in our Constitution, they can also dismantle the other rights and privileges afforded our residents.” The president took to his social media platform, Truth Social, after the arguments before the Supreme Court. “The Radical Left SleazeBags, which has no cards remaining in its illegal bag of tricks, is, in a very coordinated manner, PLAYING THE REF with regard to the United States Supreme Court,” he posted. “They lost the Election in a landslide, and with it, have totally lost their confidence and reason. They are stone cold CRAZY! I hope the Supreme Court doesn’t fall for the games they play. The people are with us in bigger numbers than ever before. They want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump continued lashing out throughout Friday after the US Supreme Court maintained a block on his deportations under wartime law. The US government is ultimately “an honor system,” Tong said, constructed of people bound together by belief and commitment to democratic principles. No higher power is going to force Trump to comply with the rule of law, but the country is too diverse and decentralized to be “swallowed whole” by any one administration, he added “Be as noisy and chaotic and boisterous as we can be,” he said, “in every state and every jurisdiction, and make it hard for them every step of the way.” The post New England AGs to Trump: ‘Bring it on’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-16-at-7.44.00%E2%80%AFPM.png?fit=1024%2C602&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 22:00:52.535214

(Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)Tolling on the Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River will start a year later than planned – but drivers traveling between Washington and Oregon may pay a little more than originally forecast as a result.
Tolling in both directions on the existing bridge will be one of the first things the public experiences once construction of a replacement bridge gets underway. It is also a critical source of funding to help cover the cost of the project, which could range from $5 billion to $7.5 billion.
For months,it’s been projected that toll collections would begin on the existing bridge early next year when construction of the replacement bridge was expected to start. Project managers now say tolling won’t start before the summer of 2027, likely after the megaproject is underway.
On Friday, a panel of transportation commissioners from each state pondered how best to avoid losing out on a year’s worth of revenue.
The Bi-State Tolling Subcommittee recommended sticking to the initial toll rate shared with the public over months of meetings, but the committee said rates should increase enough in the second and third years to make up for the year delay.
Each state’s transportation commission must approve the recommendation. If that happens, work will begin to detail how much revenue can be generated from different toll rates. 
Several possible rate scenarios are under review. These have one-way rates ranging from $1.55 to $4.70 with higher prices during peak travel times. It is assumed rates will rise on a yearly or biannual basis. 
In separate meetings this month, the Washington State Transportation Commission and Oregon Transportation Commission learned about the different options for making up for the year’s loss of collections. 
On Tuesday, Washington commissioner Debbie Young said that in the first year it was important to let the public know they would “keep the toll rate that we said we would.” She supported increasing it more in the ensuing years to catch up. 
Other commissioners agreed with the approach – as long as the target for toll receipts is met.
“We want to finish this with a bridge,” Commissioner Nicole Grant said.
Delayed toll collections are a byproduct of slower-than-planned progress on other parts of the project.
The final analysis of the project’s environmental impacts won’t be done until the end of the year. Officials with the Interstate Bridge Replacement Program said in a statement that they expect to get a key federal approval known as an amended record of decision in early 2026. It is needed before construction-related contracts can be issued.
“Our federal agency partners have provided us with our current schedule,” the statement reads, adding construction is expected to begin sometime in 2026.
Based on that schedule, planners now anticipate cars would begin driving across a new bridge in 2032 or 2033 and construction would last at least 10 to 15 years through the five-mile corridor on either side of the bridge.
Meanwhile, Washington state lawmakers passed legislation allowing for a huge increase in the amount of toll revenues assumed for the multi-year project.
House Bill 1958, which awaits action by Gov. Bob Ferguson, would authorize the state to sell up to $2.5 billion in general obligation bonds, $900 million more than assumed when the bill was first introduced in February. With significant cost increases on major highway and bridge projects in recent years, backers have said it made sense to recalibrate but doing so doesn’t mean the state will necessarily seek higher bonding capacity. 
Bonds, a long-assumed source of financing for the new span, would pay for design and construction, as well as future maintenance and operation.
The borrowed money would be repaid with toll proceeds, gas taxes and vehicle fees. Because the bonds would be backed by “the full faith and credit of the state,” the general fund could be tapped as a last-resort source of repayment.
Because Washington will be administering the tolling program, it is the one that needs to issue the bonds.

The frustration is tied to apprehension about government spending as well as strings attached to federal grants. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A trio of Republican members on the Kansas State Board of Education shared frustration with routine acceptance of federal grants for education programs that include policy mandates contrary to political perspectives of many of their constituents.
During recent meetings of the state Board of Education, members Debby Potter of Garden Plain, Connie O’Brien of Tonganoxie and Michelle Dombrosky of Olathe shared objections to linking federal spending to policy.
Attorneys with the state Board of Education and Kansas State Department of Education warned the 10-member board to give careful consideration to votes on federal grants to avoid undermining operation of school districts statewide.
“If we just vote ‘no’ on money, then where does that leave us?” said state board chairperson Cathy Hopkins of Hays. “What is the plan?”
Dombrosky, who won election to the board in 2018 and reelection in 2022, said federal aid to schools was infected with ill-conceived mandates put in place by the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden. Objectionable ideas attached to education grants made it into books and other classroom resources, she said. Republican President Donald Trump is in the process of reversing Biden-era mandates, she said.
“A lot of parents went crazy over the curriculum that was coming into our school system,” she said. “Now, we have a new administration that’s in there that’s pulling these things back, because people voted for that. People wanted that out of there. They wanted it out of the school system.”
She said the state’s acceptance of federal aid placed local Kansas school districts in a quandary.
“Sounds to me like we’ve fostered a dependency on the federal money,” Dombrosky said. “If this money were to go away tomorrow, would it stand alone on merit?”
 
Culture change
O’Brien, a former member of the Kansas House who won election to the state board in 2024, said excessive spending across government and mounting debt at the federal level necessitated cuts in expenditures. She also expressed opposition to anchoring policy to federal grants.
“When I talk to people, they’re concerned about taxes,” she said. “At some point, we need to start reining in the spending part and we’re going to have to do it in education, health care, everything.”
Potter, also elected last year to the state board, has said obligations attached to federal grants sought to diminish the influence of parents who were responsible for deciding the type of education provided their children.
The federal government is an intrusion into the relationship between parents and teachers, she said.
Potter said she was eager to create an environment that restored public faith in the state Board of Education.
“I’m trying to change the culture, somewhat, of the board,” Potter said.
She said she wanted more information included in official minutes of monthly state board meetings so Kansans had a better idea what transpired and what was said on financial and policy matters.
“We have constituents that do not trust the administration, and the administration has not earned my trust either,” she said.
 
State obligations
Scott Gordon, general counsel to the Kansas State Department of Education, said most federally funded programs included measures intended to hold recipients accountable. Failure to comply could place the entirety of funding at risk, he said.
“Generally, there is an all-or-none approach to compliance,” Gordon said. “You don’t get to comply with 75% or 80% of the federal requirements and still get to keep all the money.”
For example, he said, on April 8 the state board voted on a motion to earmark $20,000 in federal funds to sponsor public service announcements with information about where children could receive free meals during summer months. The 5-5 tie vote was equivalent to rejection of the motion, which meant opponents Dombrosky, P0tter, O’Brien, Dennis Hershberger and Danny Zeck, all Republicans, were successful in blocking expenditure of those federal dollars to inform children and families.
That federal funding previously created a 1:3 match, meaning the $20,000 investment generated the equivalent of $60,000 in advertising in Kansas.
Gordon said the board’s vote on the $20,000 allocation was the type that theoretically could threaten Kansas’ free- and reduced-lunch program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state Department of Education has the option of seeking an alternative funding source for promoting the summer food program, he said.
“It doesn’t just hurt the board or the department,” he said. “It hurts the people that are relying on that money.”
 
Due process
Mark Ferguson, who has provided legal counsel to the state Board of Education since 2009, said the recommendation wasn’t that board members should continue federal programs just because the state had done so for years.
“There’s not an expectation that you continue to just rubber stamp those things,” he said.
He urged the state Board of Education to work through funding or policy issues in a way that provided due process to recipients of those programs. Due process included notice to Kansans about potential changes and granted people an opportunity to share their views, he said.
He said the state board hadn’t previously incorporated the due process piece into decision making because, as a whole, actions of the state board on federal programs largely maintained the status quo. Change in the state board’s membership altered the dynamic sufficiently to warrant adoption of due process guidelines, he said.
“I would encourage the board, if making decisions that negatively impact others, to factor in due process,” Ferguson said. “Let’s not just vote ‘no’ and take that away. Let’s anticipate that decision, give notice to the public and get some input so that’s not just the rug being pulled out in the 11th hour.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Michelle-Dombrosky-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 20:03:10.357634

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s rates on unemployment and job growth are surpassing national averages this year and the state has kept its top spot in economic outlook ranking. But, amid tariffs, and a dropping consumer sentiment, economists warn the state is entering risky waters.
The state’s economy is outperforming other states, with jobs growing 2.1%, almost doubling the 1.2% national average. Utah also has some of the lowest unemployment rates, 3.1%, while that number remained unchanged at 4.2% nationally, according to a report from the Utah Department of Workforce Services released on Friday.
“Labor market indicators remain robust, with broad job expansions across industries and a low unemployment rate,” Ben Crabb, chief economist with the department, said in a statement. “The level of job openings continues to exceed the number of unemployed workers in the state as employers promptly employ available labor.”

The top private sector industries adding jobs to the state are education and health services, followed by construction and manufacturing.
According to Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute data shared by Natalie Gochnour, the institute’s director, to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, nearly half of the state’s jobs are in Salt Lake County, and 1 in 4 jobs are in Salt Lake City. “A stunning number when you think of the breadth of the state,” Gochnour said. That’s over 400,000 roles in the city. 
Immigration, housing and tariffs awake uncertainty in Utah’s 2025 economic outlook

“We’re in an elite economy nationwide, as a state, and the urban center is participating and contributing to the economic vibrancy of the state in a big way.”
Utah also led the nation in gross domestic product growth in 2024 with 4.5%, compared to a 2.8% national average, and earned other top spots in the country, including one of the highest household incomes with cost of living adjustments, and the lowest poverty rate. 
But a recession is possible
With this economic growth, whether a recession is coming is not apparent yet, Gochnour said. However, Utahns may still feel the impact of other economic national trends, and she believes it is for “self-inflicted” reasons, such as tariffs, which she described as “a tax on trade.”
“A reason many of the economists aren’t forecasting a recession right now is because as things start to look bad, the administration will change and come to the rescue,” Gochnour said. 
During the first term of the Trump administration, tariff rates went from 1% to 3%, which the Biden administration kept. Now, according to Moody’s Analytics calculations, the potential rate during President Donald Trump’s second term could climb to 11.5%. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Estimates predicting the future economics in the country have been uncertain this year and are constantly changing. But, the latest numbers, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Gardner Institute and Wells Fargo Economics, indicate that there may be a recession during the last half of 2025, with the country’s gross domestic product falling 0.9% during the third quarter and 1.1% during the fourth quarter.
“Right now, the probability of a recession among most economists is somewhere in the 45% to 60% rate,” Gochnour said. “So, flip of a coin. We’ll see.”
What’s already happening, though, is the free fall of consumer sentiment in the country, an index used to measure how consumers view current and future economic conditions.
“And so you got a consumer that’s feeling a little funky, you’ve got businesses with a lot of uncertainty, so they’re not hiring, or they’re pausing, they’re not investing, and eventually that’s going to show up in the numbers,” she said. “This should be a leading indicator to all of us.”
Another fall felt in the state is a decline of job growth in leisure and hospitality. According to the Department of Workforce Services’ summary, that industry shrank by 400 jobs in the last year, the second-largest private sector decline after the trade, transportation and utilities industry, which experienced the loss of 2,300 jobs.
Gochnour attributes that to tempered international travel, an effect of federal policies, as well as cuts in national parks, with employee counts declining 13% only this year, among other causes. The forecast for international visitation as of March is a 9.4% decline, according to Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics research company.
“This is something that’s expected and well known in the leisure and hospitality sector, that we’re going to feel some pain from that contraction,” she said. 
However, there will also be some other balancing forces, at least for Salt Lake City, with the opening of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ remodeled Temple Square in 2027, which is expected to attract millions of visitors.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)A federal judge will soon decide whether media should have guaranteed access to witness Indiana’s next execution, which is scheduled to take place just after midnight Tuesday.
During a Friday morning hearing in Evansville, in Indiana’s southern district, lawyers representing five news entities — including the Indiana Capital Chronicle — argued that a state law barring press from witnessing state executions violates the First Amendment.
The plaintiffs asked Judge Matthew Brookman to issue a preliminary injunction that would block the state law, for now, and ensure that journalists have access to the scheduled execution of death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, as well as future executions during the pendency of the case.
News outlets seek to pause Indiana law barring journalists from witnessing executions

Up for debate, as well, is a Department of Correction (DOC) policy that says press “shall not be permitted to witness the execution.”
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
The Indiana Attorney General’s Office pushed back, arguing that journalists have no constitutional right, or privilege, to witness executions.
Jeff Garn, representing the state, emphasized that any last-minute changes to add media to the upcoming execution’s witness lists would disrupt a “highly-coordinated” process that’s been rehearsed for months by DOC staff. 
He questioned, too, whether the state prison’s two designated execution chamber witness rooms can be modified — in a matter of days — to accommodate additional capacity.
The federal judge did not immediately rule on the preliminary injunction request but promised a “timely” decision.
Room for reporters
Attorneys with the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press are representing the news entities, which include the Capital Chronicle, The Associated Press, Gannett, Circle City Broadcasting and TEGNA.
Lin Weeks, on behalf of the plaintiffs, maintained Friday that public access to executions is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability as the state carries out “the most severe” punishment it can impose. Journalists, he said, serve as surrogates of the public.
“Public access ensures executions are competently and humanely administered,” Weeks told the court, adding that details, including any “missteps,” about such procedures “should be known to members of the public.”
“The public,” he continued, “needs to see justice carried out.”

Weeks said media-reported information is also of importance to other condemned inmates awaiting to be put to death. Ritchie and six other men are currently on death row at Indiana State Prison.
The news organizations’ underlying complaint centers on an Indiana law that limits attendance at executions to: the warden, a warden’s designated assistant, the prison physician, another physician, a spiritual advisor, a prison chaplain, five friends or relatives of the inmate and eight members of the victim’s family.
Weeks said the plaintiffs are seeking four witness spots specifically for reporters. Current law and DOC policy only allow 13 witnesses total.
Those four witnesses could be included in the 13 allowed currently, or additional spots could be added to one or both rooms that provide visibility into the execution chamber, Weeks told the judge.
He said the Capital Chronicle and other news outlets have requested spots on Ritchie’s witness list but have so far been denied.
Reporters from all five news entities have covered portions of the case and The Associated Press regularly covers executions nationwide.
Indiana is one of 27 states with the death penalty, but one of only two states — along with Wyoming — that doesn’t include media witnesses at executions.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith witnessed December’s state execution of Joseph Corcoran — via the inmate’s guest list.
Weeks also held that Indiana’s law treats the press more harshly than other members of the public. While victims’ families and a condemned person’s friends or clergy may attend, the media is explicitly barred unless a journalist is handpicked by the inmate.
He additionally pointed out that up to 10 journalists are allowed to observe federal executions conducted at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. Closed-circuit television has also been available in the past for federal prison executions to be viewed outside the designated witness areas.  
State says request comes ‘too late’
Garn, however, argued that executions are not public events and that media have no inherent right to witness them. 
“They do not have a right to observe the execution,” Garn said, maintaining that executions differ from criminal trials, for example. “This is not a (public) proceeding. This is an operation, carrying out a sentence of an incarcerated person.”
He said it’s “unclear” how DOC staff would accommodate media if a short-notice injunction is granted.
“This case was brought too late for the execution scheduled on Tuesday,” Garn reiterated.

He emphasized that chairs in the execution chamber’s two witness rooms “are literally bolted to the floor,” leaving limited flexibility for additional observers.
He said the plaintiffs filed their primary injunction request “too late,” noting that the state requested an execution date for Ritchie in September, and a challenge to state law “should have been filed earlier.” The Indiana Supreme Court set the execution date April 15.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal, one of the defendants — and the only person to provide witness testimony before the court at the Friday hearing — also raised concerns about the confidentiality of execution team members.
“If the identities of those involved are not protected, I wouldn’t have a team,” the warden said.
Neal presided over Corcoran’s execution in December. Before that, he was involved in the 2009 state execution of Eric Wrinkles — the last death sentence to be carried out before Indiana’s 15-year execution hiatus.  
He said the execution room for the condemned holding five witnesses is “tight” and “very limited.” His court declaration said it was 10-by-10 feet.
Online descriptions of a 10-by-10 foot-storage unit say it is equivalent to a small bedroom or half of a one-car-garage.
The Capital Chronicle’s experience at the December execution found there were four chairs in the condemned witness room bolted to the two-levels of the riser. In addition, there were three empty chairs elsewhere in the room. Two guards also were in the room.
After an execution date is set, Neal said DOC staff practice the process at least once each week ahead of the execution date. 
Communication between the prison and offices of the governor and the attorney general are tested. An intravenous line is inserted “into a live (volunteer) every time” a training is held.
Staff are also taught the precise steps taken to escort witnesses to and from the execution chamber. Neal conceded, though, that “there’s always a possibility that folks don’t show up, and we plan accordingly.”










We take it very seriously … we don’t want to make any mistakes.


– Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal


All DOC employees involved in the process then participate in a full, step-by-step “dress rehearsal” the day before a scheduled execution, Neal said.
“We go to great lengths … just as we would on the day of an execution,” he told the court. “We take it very seriously … we don’t want to make any mistakes.”
Garn suggested the case could be more appropriately litigated after the current execution, and even mentioned a possible future settlement conference. 
Weeks, referencing Neal’s testimony, argued that DOC staff are trained “to handle flexibility in the number of people” who attend as witnesses.
The media attorney argued that DOC staff have accommodated changes to witness lists before — even in the days preceding an execution — and could still do so before Tuesday.
Gov. Mike Braun rejected a clemency plea from Ritchie on Wednesday, one day after the Indiana Parole Board recommended that the death row inmate’s upcoming execution proceed as scheduled.
Ritchie, who fatally shot Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney during a police pursuit on Sept. 29, 2000, had petitioned the board to commute his death sentence to life without parole.

Three bills passed in 2025 changing voter laws have been challenged in court. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Two lawsuits challenging three different voter-related laws passed during the 2025 Legislative Session were filed this month in Montana district courts, pushing back against a suite of bills Republican legislators have said are essential to preserve the integrity of the state’s elections.
The Montana Federation of Public Employees on Monday filed a lawsuit alleging a bill repealing election-day registration, and a bill strengthening voter ID requirements, are unconstitutional, while the Montana Public Interest Research Group (MontPIRG) filed suit earlier this month against a bill that prevents college students from voting in a community unless they intend to stay there permanently. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, signed all three bills, which largely passed along partisan lines, into law. 
House Bill 413, introduced by Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, changed the definition of residency in Montana code, stating that individuals cannot become residents, and therefore vote, in a county if they are there for “temporary work, training, or an educational program.” The bill includes a requirement that voters intend to make a county their permanent home following their temporary purpose in order to vote. 
MontPIRG, which represents nearly 28,000 students across the state, said the law effectively disenfranchises any college students who move to attend school. 
“HB 413 singles out these students and requires them to attest—under penalty of perjury—that they intend to make the county where they are studying their “permanent home at the conclusion of” their “educational program,” thus deterring and depriving many students of the ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote,” the complaint, filed in Missoula District Court, states. 
As an example, court documents say that a student from Sidney who moves to Missoula for college must predict where she will live after she graduates, and if she doesn’t commit to living in Missoula County, she “cannot register to vote there — the community where she lives works, volunteers, likely pays taxes, and studies.”
But, if that student drops out of school and gets a job in town, she can register to vote as long as she’s been in Montana for 30 days, “irrespective of her future plans.”
While speaking on the bill during the Legislature, Gillette said the bill was not aimed at students, but at temporary workers such as traveling nurses. She also said the bill was about intent — and someone living in a community for several years could still have the intention to leave and that should be taken into consideration before they can vote in that community. 
“By imposing special requirements that bar student voters from registering to vote in their communities, HB 413 violates the rights of suffrage and equal protection guaranteed by the Montana and U.S. Constitutions,” according to the complaint. 
The two bills challenged by MFPE in Lewis and Clark District Court were carried by Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka. 
Senate Bill 490 tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on the day of the election under the new law, and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it up on the prior Saturday. 
Previously, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations. 
Last Election Day, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot. 
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill. 
“The intent is to smooth out the process and avoid votes being cast many hours beyond the intended closing of the polls at 8 a.m.,” Cuffe wrote. 
Both of the bills challenged, along with others Cuffe carried in the Legislature, were intended to bolster Montanans’ “confidence in the purity of our elections. That’s why I focused so much of my time on the issue,” Cuffe said.
Senate Bill 276 enacts photo identification voting in Montana, and expands the variety of ID options allowed to include tribal photo ID cards, military IDs, U.S. Passports, driver’s licenses and student ID cards. 
“Voter identification is a nonpartisan, commonsense best practice, and I’m pleased that the Montana Legislature agrees,” said Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen in a press release when the bill was sent to Gianforte. “Enacting these voter ID laws will streamline processes for election officials and provide a better election experience for Montana voters.”
The legal complaint from MFPE cites a Montana Supreme Court decision from 2024 that struck down a law passed in 2021 eliminating Election Day voter registration, and another that sought to narrow the list of acceptable photo IDs allowed, as evidence for why the new bills should fail. 
“These bills are plainly unconstitutional and clearly contravene the Supreme Court’s (decision),” according to court filings. “This Court must enjoin the Legislature’s attempted end-run around binding precedent and the voting rights of Montana citizens.”
Attorney Raph Graybill, a former Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor, is representing the plaintiffs in both cases. The Elias Law Group is also representing the plaintiffs.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota will need a third more prison space than it has now by 2036, and lawmakers’ choice to pass a so-called truth in sentencing bill in 2023 is a major reason why.
That’s among the takeaways from a new report on the state’s prison infrastructure that says the state would need to spend between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion on new prisons to deal with an inmate population that’s projected to swell in spite of the state’s decreasing crime rate. 
The state needs a 1,700-bed men’s prison immediately, the report from Arrington Watkins says. Even then, it says, another 1,500 beds for men will be necessary in a little more than 10 years, when it projects a prison population of more than 5,000 people. 
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

The state signed a $729,000 contract with the Phoenix-based firm as part of “Project Prison Reset,” a work group formed by gubernatorial fiat in the face of state lawmakers’ refusal to back an $850 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Lincoln County in February.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, chairman of the work group, said the report supports the group’s first official vote last month, which was to conclude that the state does need at least one new prison. 
Venhuizen was quick to point out that the $2 billion price tag would only apply if the state followed the consultant’s guidance to the letter and built two large prisons, but said the population projections lay bare the stakes of South Dakota’s current approach to criminal justice.
The work group’s job is not to address the drivers of prison population growth, he said. But he also said he’s glad the report took note of those driving forces. 
The truth in sentencing bill, SB 146, requires people convicted of violent offenses to serve between 85% and 100% of their sentences, depending on the category of their crime.
As a legislator in 2023, Venhuizen voted against SB 146, and its potential to impact prison populations “was part of the reason why.”
“Those decisions are not free. You have to strike a balance there,” Venhuizen said. “If you’re sending people to prison for longer, there is a cost to that.”
The bill’s author and prime sponsor, Republican former Sen. Brent Hoffman, has a different take on the legislation’s impact on South Dakota’s correctional needs. 
“The real issue isn’t SB 146, which protects the public by requiring violent criminals to serve their sentences,” said Hoffman, a supporter of term limits who served one term and opted against running for a second in 2024. “The underlying, systemic problems are recidivism rates, wasteful spending, misguided priorities and incompetence, and those problems won’t be solved by any consultant’s report or politician’s rhetoric.”
Prison population growth
Every correctional facility in South Dakota is beyond its capacity now. The South Dakota State Penitentiary was built in 1881 to house one inmate per cell, but holds twice as many. 
The proposed 1,500-bed facility in Lincoln County, mired in controversy over cost and necessity and still tied up in litigation over its location, was meant to replace the penitentiary. 
There are two other housing units on the penitentiary campus in Sioux Falls, however, and each of those faces its own issues with overcrowding.
The maximum-security Jameson Annex, for example, is overbooked because it houses not only maximum security inmates, but those in disciplinary segregation and those with serious mental health needs. It’s also the sorting zone for every new male inmate in the state system, where inmates stay as they’re assessed for longer-term placement.
With $50 million spent already, state hires new consultant to restart prison planning

The Sioux Falls Minimum Center, meanwhile, holds 245 men in a building designed for 96.
Even with a large but temporary drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, new admissions to Department of Corrections custody grew an average of 3.2% a year between 2015 and 2024, the report says.
That’s in spite of a crime rate in South Dakota that’s lower than the national average and on the decline. The state’s total population has gone the other direction, increasing by 0.9% a year since 2010.
Much of the long-term factors built into the new report were present for its predecessor, a report from Omaha’s DLR group that pointed to a 1,500-bed men’s facility as one of several necessary projects for the DOC.
Senate Bill 146 is a wrinkle that didn’t exist for the DLR group, some portions of which were used by Arrington Watkins in its expedited, two-month repeat assessment.
SB 146 ropes in fewer than 10% of the state’s inmates, the report notes – drug offenses are the most common charge for which South Dakotans are imprisoned – but the inability of those convicted of violent offenses to be released before serving at least 85% of their sentence will have a long-term impact on prison population growth.
“Roughly half” of the 1,246 more inmates the report anticipates South Dakota will have by 2036 is attributable to SB 146.
Parole violations are another driver of population growth, the report notes. About 45% of new admissions to the DOC came by way of parole violations in 2024, the report says, and 84% of those violations “were technical in nature rather than new criminal charges.”
Minnehaha County State’s Attorney Daniel Haggar cautioned that technical parole violations often involve serious misbehavior, however. Technical violations include drug use, he said, as well as absconding – losing touch with a parole officer altogether.
“When those offenders are violent offenders or sex offenders this is a threat to public safety,” he said in an email to South Dakota Searchlight on Friday.
Responses colored with skepticism of price tag, conclusions
The state has already spent more than $50 million on the Lincoln County site, although a share of that money could be clawed back by selling land or reusing aspects of the now-stalled prison’s design.
Governor relents, appoints task force to reset prison talks after legislative loss

The new report’s top recommendation is a 1,700-bed, Level V facility, built within 30 miles of the existing penitentiary to relieve crowding across the entirety of the men’s prison system. It also recommends demolishing the 1881 penitentiary.
“Level V” is correctional nomenclature for maximum security.
Former penitentiary warden Doug Weber wrote seven letters to lawmakers during the 2025 session urging them to say no to the 1,500-bed facility in Lincoln County, essentially a smaller version of what the new report says is necessary. 
The focus on the factors driving the state’s prison population growth raises important questions, Weber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday, but he disagrees strongly with its conclusions on how to remedy the situation.
“There’s nobody in South Dakota, in my opinion, except a handful of people, maybe in Pierre, that would be comfortable spending $2.1 billion on buildings for the Department of Corrections,” said Weber. “There are much better ways to spend money.”
Weber called a Level V facility unnecessary and too expensive in a state where the number of maximum security inmates hovers around 200. 
He also bristles at the idea of knocking down the pen. Millions have been spent to maintain it in recent years, including for air conditioning less than five years ago, and Weber said it could easily serve as a minimum security facility by removing the cell doors and putting a single person in each cell.
Republican Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, a work group member and candidate for governor in 2026, said “there’s absolutely no way that I will support spending that much money on prisons.”
“If we needed to be building new facilities, we should be looking at the current location in Sioux Falls for a lot less money,” Hansen said.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

Madeline Voegeli, one of the neighbors to the Lincoln County site who sued the state over the issue, said in an email to Searchlight that the group has serious doubts about the veracity of the report’s population projections.
The DLR report, completed in 2022, suggested a 1,300-bed men’s prison at a cost of around $608 million.
Now, she wrote, “we’re being told to swallow a nearly quadrupled cost of up to $2.1 billion, largely driven by SB 146 and questionable population projections.”
Voegeli accused the state of engaging in a “pattern of inflating proposals to make a billion-dollar plan” – the original Lincoln County proposal – “appear reasonable.”
Venhuizen said arguments suggesting that the Lincoln County plan’s supporters tried to tip the scale in the consultant’s report are misplaced.
“It’s not a strong position to assume that everyone who disagrees with you is being dishonest,” Venhuizen said. “If you’re doing that, you should probably examine the strength of your own arguments.”
Criminal justice reform questions
Rep. Karla Lems, a Canton Republican who’s both a work group member and an avowed opponent of the Lincoln County proposal, said Friday that she’s skeptical of the conclusions, as well.
The work group is meant to deliver its recommendations to a special legislative session in July. The state, she said, needs to spend more time thinking about reducing repeat offenses before it decides what to build.
Rep. Brian Mulder, R-Sioux Falls, is also a work group member. He said the state needs to think “innovatively” on how to reduce prison populations, and that the report is a clear sign of how necessary that is. Mulder was one of the prime sponsors of a bill to change the penalty for first- and second-offense drug ingestion from a felony to a misdemeanor during the 2025 session. 
Too few prisoners are getting drug treatment, Mulder said, and he feels the state ought to consider partnering with nonprofits to extend treatment’s reach both inside the prison and outside, for parolees.
He also has questions about parole supervision practices.
“I would ask ‘what’s going on now with things like remote monitoring,’” Mulder said. “It’s a lot more effective for the state for someone so they can continue to be held accountable, but be held at home.”

Mulder supported truth in sentencing and continues to, though. He said parole reforms make more sense. 
Reforms to truth in sentencing laws ought to be up for consideration, though, according to Zoë Towns, executive director of a bipartisan think tank called Fwd.Us.
Her group pushes for changes to criminal justice and immigration policy. The knock-on effects of incarceration for families and communities are heavy, Towns said, and the returns for public safety diminish significantly when inmates don’t have a chance to earn credit for good behavior – even when the people earning them committed violent offenses.
“What we should be asking is ‘how long is incapacitation actually helpful?’” Towns said. “What are the policies that are most likely to help people, when they come home, to contribute to their communities and local economies?”
Addressing behavioral health needs and addiction early on are more effective ways to deal with crime than incarceration, she said, but other strategies are even further removed from criminal justice.
Towns pointed to research from places like the Brookings Institute that suggest investments in youth education and public health offer long-term returns for public safety.
“It’s literally after school and public school programs,” Towns said. “That has a stronger homicide reduction rate than policing does. I’m not saying there’s not a role for policing. I’m saying that actually, factually, in evidence, has a stronger return than sleeping in prison.”
The next Project Prison Reset meeting is June 3 in Pierre.

Toddlers lobby for Diaper Bank funding
The tiniest lobbyists had a heavy task, trying to get the appropriation for diapers more than doubled after the Lamont administration and legislature’s Appropriations Committee have finished versions of the state budget.The Diaper Bank of Connecticut, which provides diapers to Medicaid-eligible families, was not hesitant to play the cute card Thursday, having toddlers at the state Capitol as they lobby for more money.This is the time of year when some legislators, overwhelmed by the requests for money, ofttimes for needs they would love to meet, are tempted to walk by the throngs of advocates with eyes fixed on some distant point. Hence, the mini-lobbyists, as well as robocalling using kids, to see if the $756,000 in the budget for diapers just might get bumped to, say, maybe $2 million?Janet Stolfi Alfano of the Diaper Bank said she knows that some lawmakers might rank diapers behind even more basic needs like housing and food. “We don’t fit nicely into one of those buckets,” she said.But she points to Yale research that found a top source of maternal stress was the availability and affordability of diapers, which she found shocking. “We knew it was significant,” she said.The Diaper Bank is 20 years old, founded in 2004 after a social worker saw the need and some families who tried to the stretch the supply in ways potential harmful to the babies. The state put $150,000 in the budget in 2007, then nothing in 2008, when the bottom fell out of the economy and state finances. They’ve received hundreds of thousands since then each year, but it’s not enough to serve the need.“As of now, we’re $756,000 a year, and we’re serving about 6,000 kids with that. But we know there’s about 70,000” more who could qualify using Medicaid eligibility as a standard, she said.Efforts to make it covered by Medicaid have not gone anywhere. “While we’re glad it wasn’t cut, we know that we could be serving more families,” she said. “We could scale up very easily.”— Mark Pazniokas, Capitol Bureau Chief
Inspector general transition
Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday that Judge Eliot Prescott would assume the post of inspector general this summer.The office of the Inspector General was created in the 2020 Police Accountability Law, and established in 2021. The inspector general’s role involves investigating deaths of incarcerated individuals in custody and incidents in which people are killed by police officers.Inspector General Robert Devlin, who has held the post since 2021, only brought one single case to trial during his tenure – that of State Trooper Brian North, who was tried for manslaughter after shooting 19-year-old Mubarak Soulemane, who was the subject of a high-speed chase in 2020. North was acquitted in 2024.Devlin said during a press conference Wednesday that the verdict in North’s trial has not changed the way he thinks about the way the office should operate.“The statute’s very clear. If the inspector general determines that that shooting is not justified, we’re to bring it to court and present that case, and the fair-minded jurors in our state will make a decision about it. So it hasn’t changed my view of that at all,” said Devlin.Lamont emphasized the importance of the inspector general’s role in establishing trust between the community and law enforcement. Prescott said he believed that if cases in which law enforcement found itself at odds with the public were handled fairly, it could lessen the controversy that surrounded them.There are currently over 20 investigations pending in the inspector general’s office. The most recent report addresses a death while in the custody of the Wolcott Police Department that dates back to October 2023.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Lamont talks transportation funding
The few hundred state transportation officials gathered in Hartford had an assortment of projects to ooh and ahh at: a newly-renovated State Pier, a well-regarded bus rapid-transit system and, of course, lots of highway construction.The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials — led this year by Connecticut’s own transportation commissioner, Garrett Eucalitto — held its spring conference at the Connecticut Convention Center this week.On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont stopped by to deliver a keynote speech praising Eucalitto’s work and the federal money that is funding much of it.“As Garrett and I go around the state, we’re christening bridges that are being replaced — a lot of movable bridges were built by William McKinley, Donald Trump’s favorite president,” Lamont joked. “We’re retrofitting, rebuilding and getting those going again.”Lamont’s general message of optimism was tempered somewhat, however, when he cautioned the federal government — and by extension the Trump administration — not to be “spasmodic” about how they dole out money for transportation projects.Under the Biden administration, Connecticut was pledged billions of dollars to upgrade its aging rail and highway infrastructure. Lamont has previously raised concerns that Trump could seek to halt some of that funding, leaving behind a string of unfinished projects.So far at least, Lamont said that appears not to be the case. “The money that was promised to us seems to be flowing,” he told a reporter outside the convention hall, along with a small overture to the president.“I’d like to think that President Trump’s a builder, he knows how important infrastructure was in and around his buildings ” Lamont said. “He was there knocking the doors of probably some AASHTO guys, saying, ‘I need this to keep my building going.’”— John Moritz, Environment & Energy reporter

State lawmakers looking to crack down on any potential for “shark finning” in Connecticut waters voted to advance a statewide ban on Tuesday.Shark finning refers to the practice — already prohibited under federal law — of catching a shark, removing its fins and dumping the rest of the animal’s body back in the ocean.Because their fins are valued as a delicacy in certain overseas markets, sharks have become subject to overfishing that has put some species at the risk of extinction, according to the World Wildlife Fund.House Bill 5012 attempts to close what some lawmakers have referred to as a ‘loophole’ in the state and federal protections for sharks by banning the possession of a dismembered shark fin in Connecticut. The ban would not prohibit anglers from catching sharks if they intend to use the whole body.Even without a ban, the practice does not appear to be widespread in Connecticut. A review of the bill by the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated that the state would collect less than $500 in fines each year as a result of a ban.The bill passed the House unanimously on Tuesday and now heads to the Senate for further consideration.— John Moritz, Environment & Energy Reporter
Working group on poverty
Lawmakers in the House of Representatives voted Wednesday evening to create a working group to study ways to alleviate poverty in the state of Connecticut.Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, told lawmakers that the working group would focus on things like  universal basic income, targeted workforce training, and creating methods for “ measurable economic mobility” for the most disadvantaged.According to the most recent report from United Way, 11% of Connecticut residents live below the poverty line, and 40% live below the ALICE threshold – a measurement of the basic cost of living in a geographic area.The bill was met with pushback from Republicans, several of whom said that Connecticut already offered many programs to help residents. “We provide SNAP money, WIC money, diaper care, health care, dental care, housing, supplements, baby bonds, college supplements … and the list goes on and on and on. I would argue that we have done so much to look at poverty and we’re already doing much, much more than probably many of the states around us,” said Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly.Several Republicans also objected to the idea of introducing a Universal Basic Income proposal. “So we’re going to tax you, member of the state, and then we’re just going to give you a cash payment right back. Seems like a whole waste of time. Let the person keep the cash in the first place,” said Rep. Joe Canino, R-Torrington.Democrats pushed back. Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, noted that the high cost of things like health care, transportation and child care weigh particularly on low-income families.“My soup kitchen in my district hands out about a million meals a year. That’s not SNAP. That’s because SNAP doesn’t cover it all,” added Rep. Susan Johnson, D-Windham.The bill passed 110-37.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Senate passes higher ed scholarship bill
Senate Bill 5, one of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee’s top priority bills, passed out of the Senate Wednesday.The bill targeted better enforcement of the Roberta B. Willis Scholarship Program, a need-based and merit-based scholarship that provides Connecticut students between $4,500 and $5,200 to attend in-state higher education institutions.In February, lawmakers said about two-thirds of the students, or around 16,000, who qualified for the scholarship did not receive funds in FY22. The proposed bill would require that need-based grants equal to $4,500 per student are fully funded and for the Office of Higher Education to notify universities of the amount of scholarship money they can expect for the following fiscal year.Senate Democrats said the provisions would “help students weigh the benefits of enrolling in-state accurately.”“The cost of higher education continues to grow, and our underfunded state scholarship program encourages students to seek education elsewhere,” said Senate President Martin Looney in a news release following the bill’s passage. “By investing in our students and giving them timely notice of the amount of their Roberta Willis grants, we are allowing Connecticut students to stay in this state to receive their education, enter the workforce, grow our economy and enjoy the high quality life we have built here in Connecticut.”The bill passed unanimously.— Jessika Harkay, Education Reporter
Student mental health bill passed by House
A bill meant to ensure more seamless communication between medical providers and schools regarding students’ mental health passed out of the state House of Representatives Thursday 105-42. 
House Bill 7158 would require health care providers to share “safety plans” with schools for students who spend 12 or more days in a hospital for behavioral health concerns. The plans, which would consist of things like coping strategies and other recommendations to support the child, would only be shared with school counselors, nurses or other staff who would need the information to keep the child safe in class. The plans would be shared through a secure messaging system provided by the Office of Health Strategy, according to the bill.Currently, safety plans can only be shared if a parent brings a physical copy to the school, said Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-East Hartford, who proposed the bill.“This allows a way for the hospitals to communicate directly to school, which will make the second communication a little bit quicker,” Biggins said. “If the safety plan is shared with the school, then they would have knowledge of the steps to take in order to keep the child safe.”— Jessika Harkay, Education Reporter
Bill aims to help towns reduce blight
The Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow towns to put liens on properties where code violation fees have gone unpaid.Senate Bill 1317 is the latest attempt from the Connecticut legislature to give towns more tools to combat poor rental housing conditions and reduce blight. Connecticut tenants, particularly those with out-of-state landlords, have long said they struggle to get repairs done and are living in unsafe housing conditions.The New Haven delegation issued a press release in support of the bill after its passage. “When housing density is high, it only takes a few violations to impact entire neighborhoods,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, in the release. “This bill empowers New Haven and other cities to take necessary actions to uphold housing standards and protect public spaces.”The bill passed with bipartisan support and next heads to the House for a vote.— Ginny Monk, Housing & Children’s Issues Reporter
Measure prevents discrimination against abuse victims
A bill regarding victims of human trafficking and sexual assault passed in the House 139-4 on Thursday.The bill prohibits current or prospective employers and landlords from discriminating against victims of rape, sexual assault or human trafficking. Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said victims of rape, sexual assault or human trafficking cannot be penalized by their employer if they have to take time off work to attend court proceedings.But Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, questioned why these protections did not extend to all victims – for example, if someone had their car stolen and was unable to get to work.Fishbein also objected to the idea of an “affirmative defense” for human trafficking victims who commit misdemeanors directly related to being trafficked.Stafstrom gave the example of someone who was a victim of human trafficking and ended up prostituting themselves. “It’s a crime. It’s a misdemeanor offense to engage in prostitution. But they did so because they were trafficked here from out of state, and essentially sold into committing that particular crime,” said Stafstrom.But Fishbein said he didn’t feel that misdemeanors were only small crimes, adding that negligent homicide was considered a misdemeanor. “I’m concerned that someone is going to admit that they killed someone and make this claim of human trafficking, which may be very difficult to prove,” said Fishbein.Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, said she felt the need to disclose to a landlord or an employer that a victim had been sexually assaulted or raped in order to be protected from discrimination was “revictimizing” the person, and noted that victims of sexual assault were still victims even if they chose not to press charges or to discuss what happened to them.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Bear hunt is back
A controversial proposal to allow bear hunting in Connecticut was resurrected on Thursday, more than a month after being left for dead by state lawmakers.In March, members of the legislature’s Environment Committee stripped language from Senate Bill 1523 that would have allowed the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish a hunting season for black bears, whose numbers have risen to an estimated 1,000 to 1,200 animals in the state.When the bill appeared Thursday on the Senate floor, however, it came with an amendment adding the hunting language back in. The bill’s sponsor, state Rep. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, said the bill would leave it up to DEEP and the governor’s office to determine whether a hunt is necessary to address a growing number of conflicts with bears.“At the point that if they feel that human-bear conflicts have risen to a level that endangers public safety they could start… to look into a hunt,” he said.Opponents of a hunt said they were surprised by the sudden change in the bill. “There was no warning that this was being done,” said Lori Brown, the executive director of the League of Conservation Voters. “It’s because it’s so controversial, there’s been so much opposition.”The amended bill passed the Senate on a vote 34 to 2, with senators Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, and Mae Flexer, D-Killingly, voting in opposition. It now heads to the House for further consideration.— John Moritz, Environment & Energy Reporter",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TRUST-ACT-0515_SR-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 20:03:10.357634

Gov. Mike Dunleavy has chosen a new commissioner for the department. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has chosen a state government veteran to be the new commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
Dunleavy announced Thursday that he has selected Randy Bates, a former head of the department’s Division of Water.
“Randy is uniquely suited to assume the role of commissioner-designee for DEC and continue to push my Administration’s agenda to develop our plentiful resources responsibly and to minimize the impacts for all our actions on the environment,” Dunleavy said in a statement.
Bates, in the statement released by Dunleavy, said he is honored to be appointed. He also reinforced the governor’s emphasis on resource development.
“My primary goal as commissioner will be to continue the department’s mission of balancing the need for responsible development and preserving Alaska’s pristine lands and waters and wildlife,” Bates said in the statement.
Prior to serving as director of DEC’s Division of Water, Bates was director of the Division of Habitat at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. He also fishes commercially in Southeast Alaska.
Bates replaces Acting Commissioner Christina Carpenter, who has been in that role since January, when former DEC Commissioner Emma Pokon was appointed as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Pacific Northwest regional administrator.
Carpenter is moving to a new job outside of state government but will remain at the department as deputy commissioner through the end of the month to help with the transition, Dunleavy said.  
Bates’ appointment is subject to confirmation by the Legislature. Since the Legislature held its annual confirmation joint session on Wednesday, it will be nearly a year before it votes on Bates.

Jim Pillen signs off on the 2024 general election results on Monday, Dec. 2, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — It’s not every day that Nebraska’s three branches of government are all involved in a single topic. But one issue is front and center within the next week: medical cannabis.
Days before legislative debate and a Lincoln court hearing, Gov. Jim Pillen on Friday announced “intentions” for executive branch staff to offer available administrative support and resources for voter-approved medical cannabis regulators to begin their work.
“With support from the Policy Research Office, the Department of Administrative Services and other agencies, as necessary, the Medical Cannabis Commission is fully enabled to meet and carry out its responsibilities under the Patient Protection Act and the Regulation Act to meet its milestone dates of July 1 [for regulations] and October 1 [for licensing],” the release said.
Any regulations proposed by the commission would need to go through the attorney general and the governor.
  State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair kneels to talk with State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue. Hansen is the lead sponsor on a 2025 bill to help give structure to the state’s new medical cannabis laws.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, whose Legislative Bill 677 seeks to clarify and place additional guardrails, confirmed he will still push forward with the legislation and was “a little surprised” by an executive about-face that now seeks to “unilaterally” enact regulations.
He said he sees LB 677 as the Legislature’s responsibility to act and set parameters for regulators that “can’t be changed at a whim.”
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that is mulling medical cannabis legislation, said the executive action diminishes Hansen’s previous argument that the laws could be the “wild west” if the Legislature doesn’t provide more guidance. 
“I think there’s actually been some thought into establishing the cannabis control commission. It’s not a bad thing,” Holdcroft told the Nebraska Examiner on Friday.
But Hansen, in response, said: “I’m not worried about the ‘wild west’ anymore. I’m worried about nothing happening, and then we have recreational cannabis in two years.”
He cites voters who have said that if the regulations are too restrictive, they will push a 2026 ballot measure for recreational marijuana, including some voters who prefer only medical use.
Appointees will follow ‘letter of the law’
Hansen adds that part of the reason LB 677 is still needed is Pillen’s two at-large “potential” appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. Together, they would join the three commissioners pulling double duty on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission to create the new entity, which voters approved in November.

Pillen has appointed Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Omaha, the prevention director at Heartland Family Service, which focuses on drug prevention. Both have consistently opposed efforts pushed by the Nebraskans who prevailed at the ballot box last fall after more than a decade of advocacy.

Still, Pillen said that Oldenburg and Mueting are “experienced, well-qualified individuals” who will ensure strong regulations “to the letter of the law the people of Nebraska enacted.”
“I urge the Legislature to promptly confirm them so they can take up the urgent work of writing strong and effective ‘rules of the road’ for the medical cannabis industry,” Pillen said Friday.
Both Oldenburg and Mueting opposed the closest legislative attempt to legalize medical cannabis in 2021, LB 474, led by former State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln, who later helped the ballot measures. The 2021 bill fell two votes short, 31-18.
‘Other motives may be at play’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said Friday that while supporters appreciated Pillen’s actions, it is “disingenuous” to characterize the new appointments as “experienced” or “well-qualified.”
“Appointing regulators who are fundamentally opposed to the very issue they are charged with overseeing suggests that other motives may be at play — motives that appear misaligned with the public intent, and not to mention the will of 71% of the state,” Eggers said in a statement.
The legalization position passed with 71% of the vote, while the regulatory measure trailed just slightly, with about 67% support. Eggers and other long-time advocates support LB 677 as an initial step for regulations.
At a March hearing on four medical cannabis bills, Mueting opposed LB 677 and two very similar bills and was “neutral” on the narrowest bill: LB 483, from State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, seeking to limit medical cannabis to tinctures or pills alone. LB 483 sought to legalize up to 300 milligrams, 0.21% of the 5 ounces that voters approved.
Both appointees will go before the General Affairs Committee next Thursday for confirmation hearings before the full Legislature weighs in.

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen, said the office interviewed three people and selected two. A staff member who oversees application materials for appointees was out of the office Friday, so the materials for Oldenburg and Mueting were not immediately made available.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the General Affairs Committee, said he looks forward to the confirmation hearings but is “skeptical” of Pillen’s sincerity in helping voters.
“I will keep an open mind, but any attempt to restrict what the voters passed through bureaucratic red tape should be opposed vigorously,” Cavanaugh said in a text. “In the meantime, the Legislature should pass LB 677 to make sure that medical cannabis is legal, safe and accessible in Nebraska.”
Unclear executive branch funding
Part of Pillen’s Friday announcement mentions “operational funding” already appropriated to the Medical Cannabis Commission, but when the next two-year state budget passed Thursday, new funding was limited.
The Appropriations Committee offered an annual $30,000 each of the next two fiscal years for employees in the Liquor Control Commission, who take on additional duties under the new laws. In comparison, the Liquor Control Commission has a $2 million annual budget, including for enforcement of regulations for compliance.
There is no additional funding for the remaining two months of the current fiscal year. 
The Department of Administrative Services can provide limited financial support to agencies crafting regulations, but the Governor’s Office could not immediately provide specifics.
Legislative and legal fights await
Hansen’s LB 677 is expected to be filibustered at each stage of debate, at a maximum of eight hours on Tuesday. If so, it would require 33 votes to advance and become law at the end.

Hansen said that considering Oldenburg and Mueting are “both openly staunch anti-medical cannabis people, you can only assume the direction on maybe where they’re going to go with the implementation of this.”
“If we don’t do anything, we have no idea what to expect,” Hansen said.
Holdcroft said he would support Hansen and LB 677 by arguing in favor of a “compromise” amendment to the bill, which gives an extra three months for regulations, prohibits smoking and outlines qualifying conditions.
Pillen previously told the Examiner that cannabis wouldn’t be approved in a form that could become recreational.
“My advocacy for it is that if you have a medical condition [and] you need it, you’ll get it, but it’s going to taste like crap,” Pillen said last month. “It’s going to be a bitter pill to swallow.”
‘Effectively do business’
Also on Tuesday, Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong will consider oral arguments on whether to dismiss a lawsuit that argues the voter-approved medical cannabis laws are unconstitutional because of federal laws outlawing marijuana.

Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, whose office is defending Pillen and other state officials, fundamentally opposes medical cannabis. He is asking that the case be dismissed, as are the regulatory commissioners and the ballot measure sponsors.
The reason is specific: Hilgers’ staff argues that the Attorney General’s Office and not a private citizen should be the one to challenge the laws.

(Kenneth Ferriera-Pool/Lincoln Journal Star)
LB 677 also presents a different threat to a pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, including from Hilgers’ office, alleging signature fraud in the medical cannabis ballot measures. Strong rejected those arguments in November and upheld the ballot measures. The AG’s Office and a former state senator who brought both cases before Strong appealed.
Because LB 677 would provide additional legislative weight to the 2024 ballot measures, Hilgers and other advocates have acknowledged it could nullify or weaken the pending appeal. Hilgers has said he should get a “fair fight” in front of the high court. He has also pledged to sue the new commission if it issues any medical cannabis licenses in the future, too.
With Pillen’s announcement, he joined the likes of Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., who have argued that lawmakers should wait and pass no cannabis-related bills this year.
Said Strimple: “Governor Pillen does not believe it is necessary for LB 677 to pass because with existing statutory authority and resources, the Medical Cannabis Commission will have everything it needs to effectively do business.”

Can lawmakers get health care organizations to cut tens of millions in health care expenditures?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Lawmakers encourage, but don’t require, health facilities to reduce spending.","House Majority Leader Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, seen on the opening day of the Legislature at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, Jan. 8. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont policymakers are facing a $200 million question. That’s the amount of spending — according to the Green Mountain Care Board — that the state’s health care system would need to trim in order to keep Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont’s premium increases to around 5% in 2026. It’s a big ask, and a short timeline. Earlier this week, Blue Cross Blue Shield issued its proposed premium increases for 2026: 13.7% for small group plans and 23.3% for individual ones. Without significant cost savings within the next few months, those numbers will likely stand. Lawmakers are working on several measures intended to lower health care costs. But many of those initiatives — such as reference-based pricing, a system that caps how much hospitals can charge for procedures and a bill to reduce the cost of building or renovating facilities — are years away from bearing fruit.Earlier this month, Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, introduced an amendment to a large bill, S.126, intended to trim spending in Vermont’s teetering health care system more quickly. The initial amendment, dated May 2, would have required the Agency of Human Services to “coordinate efforts by hospitals” to cut Vermont hospital spending by 10% in their fiscal year 2026, which begins Oct. 1.By the next week, the language had been softened: the agency would “facilitate collaboration and coordination” to help providers “identify opportunities” to improve health care services and reduce spending by 5%.A day later, lawmakers trimmed that savings goal further: to just 2.5%. That figure still stands in the most recent version of the bill, which was advanced by the House Appropriations Committee Friday afternoon. In an interview last week, Houghton said the initial goal of a 10% reduction in health care spending would have actually added up to $400 million — twice the number the Green Mountain Care Board asked for. So lawmakers trimmed it to 5%, which comes out to $200 million. “Then for various reasons — of just people not (being) happy, and not sure how they can do it — we did move it down to 2.5%,” Houghton said.But whatever the number is, the legislation is not intended to force health care facilities to cut spending: “There’s no mandate,” Houghton said. “Lots of times when we pass legislation, it is the intent that’s important, right?” she said. “And it’s also the fact that we need Vermonters to see that we’re all trying to find a solution to this really immediate problem.”— Peter D’AuriaIn the knowVermont is on track to join a growing list of states that have banned smartphones from the classroom.This week, lawmakers in a key committee advanced legislation that would require all of the state’s public school districts and independent schools to develop policies prohibiting students from using smartphones and other personal devices like smartwatches during the school day. The policies would need to take effect by the 2026-2027 school year.A school cell phone ban was previously introduced in a standalone bill that has failed to move forward this legislative session. But on Thursday members of the Senate Committee on Education voted to graft the ban onto H.480, a miscellaneous education bill that includes several smaller adjustments to Vermont’s education laws. Now, with broad support in both chambers, lawmakers hope to send the bill to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of the session. Read more about the new bill language here. — Habib SabetGov. Phil Scott has issued his third veto of the session, rejecting H.219, a bill that would require the Department of Corrections to roll out a program providing free family support services to incarcerated parents and guardians across state prisons. (Scott also vetoed two versions of the fiscal year 2025 budget adjustment bill.)Scott wrote in a letter explaining his decision Thursday that he supported the bill’s intent but not specific language within it that would require his administration to put funding for the program in future budget proposals to the Legislature. Such a requirement violates the state Constitution, he said.The veto may not matter much, though, since funding to run programs for incarcerated parents at two state prisons has already been included in the 2026 budget bill, which the House and Senate both approved this week. Scott supports that funding, too, he said in his veto letter.Rep. Troy Headrick, a Burlington Independent who sponsored H.219, said in an interview Friday that Scott has also expressed support for legislators’ intent, also laid out in the bill, to have the administration expand the program to all state prisons by 2028. Legislators may rework some of the language that Scott opposed in H.219 in the remaining weeks of this year’s session, Headrick said, or could take the legislation up again at the start of next year’s session. — Shaun RobinsonOn the moveA key Senate committee advanced the Legislature’s landmark education bill Thursday, but not before nearly every committee member vented their discomfort with the legislation. “I can’t remember ever feeling as bad about a vote as I do on this one, but it will move us forward,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, the Senate Finance Committee’s chair, told her colleagues after voting out H.454. The bill proposes generational changes to Vermont’s school governance and finance systems that would phase in over multiple years, including school district consolidation and a new education funding formula, but leaves open some key decision points for the future. Read more about the Senate’s version of the education reform bill here. — Ethan WeinsteinThe Senate on Friday passed H.1, a bill that would eliminate a requirement from state law that the Legislature’s two internal ethics panels consult with the State Ethics Commission over cases in which lawmakers are accused of potential misconduct. Legislators have argued that the consultation requirement, part of a sweeping set of changes to state ethics laws enacted in 2024, infringed on the separation of powers guaranteed in the state Constitution. But the proposal has drawn repeated opposition from the Ethics Commission, which argued it could be the start of a slippery slope of reneging on last year’s accountability measures.The bill will now head back to the House to consider the Senate’s changes.— Shaun RobinsonVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Lawmakers encourage, but don’t require, health facilities to reduce spending.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lori-houghton-1-20250108-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 19:05:51.346194

Jared Polis signed an executive order Friday that pushes local governments to comply with certain state housing laws as a condition of receiving state grant funding, at the Colorado Capitol in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order Friday that pushes local governments to comply with certain state housing laws as a condition of receiving state grant funding. 
The order directs several state agencies to identify funding opportunities that can be prioritized for local governments and projects that align with state housing priorities. It highlights seven state laws passed in the last two years that aim to increase housing options across the state.
Polis said the goal of the executive order is to ensure those who receive discretionary grant funding from the state are prioritizing state efforts to increase housing stock, affordability and sustainability. He estimated over $100 million dollars in state funding will be subject to the order.

“Today we’re taking action to make sure that the limited state funding opportunities are prioritized for local governments that are following state housing laws and land use laws and doing their part so hardworking Coloradans to afford to live, work and thrive across our state of Colorado,” Polis said at a press conference in his office at the Colorado Capitol, where he signed the executive order Friday.
While many local governments have supported housing policies approved by the Colorado Legislature in recent years, others opposed the policies and indicated concerns about compliance. Polis said he wants local governments to be able to go through DOLA to help them achieve compliance with new state housing laws. 
“We want to make sure everybody is working in good faith and has a plan to implement these laws,” Polis said. “Some counties have just thought about it and worked on it more than others, and we want to make sure that everybody thinks about it and works on it and gets it done because housing is a statewide issue.”
Laws covered by the executive order include 2024 measures to prohibit residential occupancy limits, require higher-density housing near transit stops, prohibit local minimum parking requirements, legalize the construction of accessory dwelling units, and encourage more sustainable affordable housing, as well as 2025 polices that set regional building codes for factory-built homes and allow some multifamily buildings to have just one staircase.
Housing availability and affordability has been a growing crisis in Colorado that state legislators worked to improve since 2023. A 2023 housing executive order Polis signed said the state is short tens of thousands of housing units, and his new order says the same concerns continue to escalate. 
Some of the laws included in the order are not yet implemented, so the provisions of the executive order will apply after the measures take effect. 
The executive order requires state agencies including the Colorado Department of Transportation, the Colorado Energy Office, the Department of Local Affairs, and the Office of Economic Development and International Trade to submit a list within 30 days of potential competitive grants and other discretionary funding sources that could be subject to the requirements of the order. 
The order will be updated once the governor’s office compiles a list of grants and funding to be included, and it will apply to funding awarded after Oct. 6.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that he will veto the Reparations Commission bill that called for a study of historic inequality endured by African descendants in Maryland.
The veto of a reparations measure by the only sitting Black governor in the nation was included a list of vetoes of bills, many of which called for summer study of an issue, typically the most innocuous type of legislation. The list of 23 bills was released late Friday afternoon by the governor’s office.
Moore’s list also includes a bill in the energy package backed by House and Senate leadership, which created a Strategic Energy Planning Office focused on the state’s energy needs.
Reaction was swift, and in some cases angry, from lawmakers, who were already discussing veto overrides.
“The governor is my friend. I think a lot of him, but I am every disappointed in him today,” said Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), who sponsored the Senate version of the reparations bill. “I’m very disappointed that something like this, that Black communities across the country have been asking for, it’s turned down in our state,”
Sponsors began getting the news Friday afternoon of the coming vetoes of their bills. Reparations was the most high-profile bill to be shot down, and chatter was widespread before the official announcement, but others learned of the demise of their bills to study the effects of climate change and to look at the impact of data centers on the state.




List of vetoed bills
Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that he will veto 23 bills passed by the 2025 General Assembly — more than in the previous two years combined, when he vetoed 13 and four, respectively. This year’s vetoes included some high-profile proposals, including a bill to create reparations study commission and another to look at the impact of data centers.

Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) said she got a text from one of the governor’s staffers Friday, alerting her that her bill, originally titled the RENEW Act, was going to be vetoed. The bill would have commissioned a study from the comptroller’s office on the effects of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, and it was a milder alternative to the original language that would have called for a system to make businesses that extract fossil fuels pay fees to mitigate the effects of climate change.
“I think a study is a very reasonable next step, and the money was allocated in the budget,” Hester said. “This is very shortsighted, because this is a bill that will eventually save taxpayers money.”
The bill was to be funded mostly by $500,000 from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is fueled by “alternative compliance payments”  utilities pay when they have not purchased enough renewable energy to comply with state mandates. That fund has burgeoned in recent years with an influx of payments, including $318 million in fiscal 2024.
Advocates were angered by the move. Mike Tidwell, founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, called the governor’s veto of the RENEW study “unforgiveable.”
“I will make sure that voters in the state never forget what he’s done with this veto,” Tidwell said, adding that the governor’s office expressed no reservations about the bill as recently as mid-March.
The veto was “inconceivable,” given that Maryland has thousands of miles of shoreline vulnerable to climate change, and the $500,000 study could have paved the way toward tens of millions of dollars in compensatory payments from fossil fuel companies, Tidwell said.

“His math doesn’t add up. His political calculus is arguably even worse, because turning his back on Marylanders suffering from climate change today is an enormously politically damaging act,” Tidwell said.
Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) said she heard from the governor’s team Friday that her bill, studying the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland would be among the vetoes. In Frederick, development of an expansive Quantum Loophole campus has been underway for years, prompting Lewis Young’s interest in the subject.
“I’m really disappointed that, given what a big topic this is for the state — and in particular for my county — that we wouldn’t proceed with a study,” Lewis Young said.
Lewis Young said she was surprised to learn of the veto, especially given that the governor’s team did not express any reservations about the bill or its cost during the legislative session. The report was to cost about $502,000, with funds pulled from the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Maryland Energy Administration and the University System of Maryland, according to its fiscal note.
More economical still was the reparations bill: Versions that failed in previous years had price tags around $1 million, but the version on the governor’s desk this year was only expected to cost $54,500. The will called for most of the work to be one by existing state employees or by researches at Bowie State University, one of the state’s historically black colleges and universities.
The bill’s supporters have pointed out repeatedly that the bill does not require any payments or support. It only calls for study of historic inequality suffered by African descendants, and recommendations for future action, if any.
“It’s not as though it was going to do something. It’s a study,” Muse said Friday evening. “When have we known a study to cause a veto? At the end of the study, nothing else has been done, except we studied it. I don’t understand it. I will not understand it.”
Advocates rallied in Annapolis a week ago, urging the governor to sign the bill, which had the backing of the Legislative Black Caucus. The caucus released a statement to express “deep disappointment” in the governor’s decision and that the “legislature will have a final say” when lawmakers meet to consider veto overrides.
“At a time when the White House and Congress are actively targeting Black communities, dismantling diversity initiatives and using harmful coded language, Governor Moore had a chance to show the country and the world that here in Maryland we boldly and courageously recognize our painful history and the urgent need to address it,” the caucus said in a statement Friday evening.
“Instead, the State’s first Black governor chose to block this historic legislation that would have moved the state toward directly repairing the harm of enslavement,” the statement said.
The bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also have examined how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs.
The 24-member commission would have had to deliver a preliminary report of recommendations by Jan. 1, 2027, to explain any findings, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.
Maryland is one of just a handful of states that have passed legislation to study reparations, including California, Illinois, New York and Colorado.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC_0373-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 19:05:51.346194

State health officials alerted the public that they could have been exposed to the virus at a Trader Joe’s in Albuquerque, along with a big medical center in Rio Rancho. 
As of Friday, there are 74 confirmed cases across New Mexico, state health officials told Source New Mexico. 
In addition to providing daily updates on the virus’ spread, health officials also provide dates, times and locations where people may have been exposed, along with a list of places where people can walk in to receive vaccines. 

Read all of Source’s measles coverage here. 

Infected people have been in a Denny’s in Hobbs, a school gym in Lovington, a preschool in Las Cruces and various medical clinics in southern and northern New Mexico in recent months. 
Measles symptoms begin with a cough, runny nose and eye redness, before progressing to fever and rash that starts at the head before moving down the body. Health officials advise that people who have measles can infect others from four days before the rash appears and remain contagious four days after the rash is gone.
In addition to Sandoval County, New Mexico has now seen confirmed cases in Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy and Lea counties. Currently, more than 1,000 measles cases have been reported nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The health department encourages people with symptoms who have been exposed to measles to call NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for guidance in English and Spanish. If planning to see a doctor or visit an emergency room, call first so health care providers can plan for a visit by someone who may have measles.

The change from the federal agency does not affect the state’s efforts to continue work already underway to reduce levels of PFAS at contaminated sites, the state’s director of drinking water regulation said. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont officials reevaluate new state standards for toxic forever chemicals as EPA eases stance.","Stock photo by Nithin PA via PexelsVermont environmental officials are pausing to reevaluate a stricter state standard for certain harmful forever chemicals after a change in stance by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this week. Barely one year after the EPA passed historic rules to reduce the amounts of certain harmful forever chemicals in drinking water, the agency is now considering reversing some of those regulations and pushing back the timeline for drinking water systems to comply with others.When the set of federal regulations passed under President Joe Biden, they set allowable levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, even lower than Vermont’s existing standards, which had been in place for five years. The stricter rules meant an additional 30 drinking water suppliers in the state needed to remove PFAS.  Now, the state’s progress on formalizing those rules is on something of a pause, as officials wait to hear more information about the federal decision.“The amount of information we have as a state, is about the same as what the public has been receiving,” said Bryan Redmond, the director of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Protection Division in the state Department of Environmental Conservation. “We are waiting to schedule some time with the EPA to learn what the details of this mean.” Wednesday’s announcement from the EPA keeps the Biden-area levels for two chemicals in the sprawling PFAS family. There can be only 4 parts per trillion or less of PFOA and PFOS chemicals detected in drinking water. However, the agency has now added two more years on the deadline for meeting those levels — meaning municipalities now have to comply by 2031, instead of 2029. The agency is also announcing a federal exemption framework for some communities struggling to remove the harmful chemicals from drinking water.The existing rules had also set a limit of 10 parts per trillion of four other types of PFAS chemicals. The EPA announced it now intends to rescind and reconsider the regulations for those other four regulated chemicals. There are more than 12,000 chemicals in this class of compounds.PFOA and PFOS are some of the most commonly occurring compounds in the PFAS family, and those are the two chemicals that typically drive the contamination issues in Vermont, according to Redmond. The chemicals in high doses are linked to a litany of harmful health effects, largely because they are suspected of interrupting hormone chemical signaling in the body, and thus can lead to a range of maladies, from cancers and reproductive health problems to cardiovascular challenges and weakened immune systems. Redmond said the next step for the state is to evaluate the EPA actions, taking thorough account of the science, the health impacts and technical details of PFAS removal. “It’s possible to move forward with the existing standards,” he said. “It’s possible that we adopt the EPA standards, or it’s possible we do a hybrid.”Regardless, the language in the draft state rule surrounding this will have to change since it references and rests on the EPA’s standards, he said. The state is “mid-stream” in that rulemaking process, but it’s been paused due to all the uncertainty from the federal agency. This, at least, Redmond said, is a “push toward certainty,” so the state can figure out how it wants to act in response. What the federal change does not influence is the state’s progress toward remediating existing drinking water systems known to be contaminated by PFAS. “Regardless of regulation, we have been remediating down to the 4 (parts per trillion) level,” Redmond said Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Vermont was allocated five years of funding to carry out the remediation process for impacted systems. Money has been appropriated for the third year of work, Redmond said, and he expects the state will receive that soon. Disclosure: Bryan Redmond is married to VTDigger CEO Sky Barsch.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont officials reevaluate new state standards for toxic forever chemicals as EPA eases stance.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-nithin-pa-2583028-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

Greg Gianforte signed two laws geared at making travel safer for both motorists and pedestrians at crossings earlier this month.
Senate Bill 471 seeks to make pedestrian crossings safer, while Senate Bill 428 makes it easier for counties to change speed limits. Senate Democrats brought both bills, which passed through the House and Senate by comfortable margins.
Sen. Dave Fern brought SB 471, which introduces a new offense into Montana code — endangerment of pedestrians to clarify who has right-of-way.
“I think it basically sets up some clearly defined rules for the pedestrian and for the driver,” Fern said during a Senate hearing for the bill. “And it sets up, I think, pretty reasonable system of fines.”
The legislation added specific language for crosswalks with flashing lights, which the new law covers. If a pedestrian has already engaged the button to begin flashing the lights, a driver may not move through the intersection.
However, if the vehicle reaches a pedestrian crossing before the light is engaged, they are allowed to drive through the intersection.
The misdemeanor offense carries an initial fine between $25 and $100. Subsequent offenses carry higher penalties. If a person hits one of the beacons, or crosswalk devices, they are also now liable for the damage to them.
SB 428 gives county governments increased ability to control speed limits on roads, dropping the minimum speed they can set to 25 mph, down from the previous minimum of 35 mph. The law allows for greater control in areas classified as urban districts.
Sen. Willis Curdy, who brought the legislation, called it a safety issue. He also said some counties had been pressured into changing speed limits outside of what state law allowed them to do.
“Outside of the legislative session, a vast majority of complaints and questions my constituents have is that people are driving too fast and the county should lower the speed limits,” Curdy said during a Senate hearing for the bill. “I sympathize 100%, but I remind them that state law does not permit the county to lower the speed limit under 35 mph. Senate Bill 428 will allow counties the opportunity to make that adjustment.”
Gov. Greg Gianforte has also signed a swath of other transportation bills, including SB 433 from Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton which changed right-of-way law in roundabouts. He also signed HB 764, a change in public transportation law that could expand municipal bus routes further.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4954-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

Jared Polis to sign Senate Bill 25-5, the Worker Protection Act, on Tuesday, May 13, 2025. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bill on Friday afternoon that would have repealed​ a requirement for a second election to form a union, a provision that’s unique to the state.
The veto was expected, as Polis, a Democrat, said from the start of the 2025 state legislative session that he wanted to see a compromise between labor and business interests over the issue. That never came.
Senate Bill 25-5 would have repealed the state requirement for a second election following a simple majority vote, per federal law, to form a union. The second vote requires 75% approval for workers to be able to negotiate whether every employee must pay into representation fees, regardless of union membership. Colorado is the only state to have that system. It was created through the Labor Peace Act over 80 years ago.
“I believe there must be a high threshold of worker participation and approval to allow for bargaining over mandatory wage deduction. And SB 25-005 does not satisfy that threshold, which is why I am vetoing the bill,” Polis wrote in his veto letter. “Nonetheless, I was and remain open to changes to the Labor Peace Act. The law can and should be amended to more fairly allow workers to choose union security.”

Polis wrote that the current system makes it easier to fully unionize at smaller companies than at larger ones “where organizing might be even more important.” He encouraged labor and business leaders to continue conversations about how to update the law.
“This two election framework makes Colorado a unique ‘hybrid,’ allowing for union security unlike ‘open shop’ states, but requiring a high threshold of approval to achieve it. I am disappointed we did not find common ground that would have resulted in me signing an updated and fairer Labor Peace Act,” he wrote.
The bill was a priority for labor groups and progressive Democrats in the Legislature this year. It passed on party-line votes in both chambers, which Democrats control by wide margins.
“This veto from Governor Polis is a betrayal of working people in Colorado, but also one we are not surprised about,” Wynn Howell, Colorado Working Families Party state director, said in a statement after the veto. “Given that he is one of the wealthiest men in Colorado, it is no shock that he is woefully out of touch with public opinion on this question.”
Howell called on Attorney General Phil Weiser and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, two Democrats in the race for Colorado governor next year, to weigh in on whether they would have signed the bill.
“Will Senator Bennet or AG Weiser stand with workers? Or will they just be more of the same stale and out of touch anti-worker politics in Colorado? Neither one has said publicly whether they would sign the Worker Protection Act, and at this point their silence is deafening. We urge them to answer that question clearly and unambiguously,” they wrote.
Business groups applauded the veto.
“CCA members value the voice of their employees,” Colorado Contractors Association President and CEO Tony Milo said in a statement. “It is of utmost importance to ensure their voices count when it comes to deducting union dues from their paychecks. The Governor did the right thing today for workers across Colorado.”

(Kate Kealey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)TOPEKA — Fuel shortages in Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska spurred a federal agency to issue an emergency declaration this week that gives leeway to commercial drivers hauling fuel.
The emergency order by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association extended an April 30 state of disaster emergency proclamation from Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly. The state-level declaration expired on May 13, said Linda Berry, spokesperson for the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates gas and oil production in the state.
Areas in Kansas and surrounding states are experiencing a fuel shortage, causing long lines at fuel stations, delivery delays and a need for truck drivers to increase the number of hours they can drive to deliver fuel, said an April 30 press release. The short-term changes only apply to drivers who are part of the fuel delivery system.
Under the declaration, drivers can temporarily work longer hours to ensure fuel supplies are going through, the release said.
“This declaration is in response to the widespread fuel shortages in affected states impacting agricultural operations and the national food supply, and their effects on people and property, including immediate threats to human life, public safety, or public welfare,” the federal declaration said.
Berry said planned pipeline and refinery maintenance and higher demands among farmers and drivers during planting season were likely sources of the supply chain disruption.

(Photo by Diyosa Carter/Getty Images)A federal judge has again temporarily blocked portions of an Iowa law aimed at restricting schools’ recognition of LGBTQ+ people and banning books with sexual or LGBTQ+ content.
The law, which was signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May 2023, was immediately challenged by Lambda Legal and ACLU of Iowa on behalf of students, teachers and the organization Iowa Safe Schools.
As originally written, the law prohibits school districts and educators from providing “any program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The court had previously enjoined the law because the terms “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” were defined so broadly as to make it impossible for a reasonable school district, teacher, or student to understand what, exactly, was prohibited.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the district court’s injunction and remanded the case with instructions to the district court to address the legality of a narrower interpretation of the law.
Thursday’s preliminary injunction reflects the district court’s conclusion that there are parts of the law that do pass constitutional muster, but only under such a narrow interpretation.
“The restrictions on ‘programs’ and ‘promotion’ relating to gender identity and sexual orientation cannot reasonably be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment,” U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher ruled. “The words ‘program’ and ‘promotion’ are simply too broad to refer only to mandatory classroom curriculum and instead prohibit school districts and educators from, among other things, making extracurricular activities relating to gender identity and sexual orientation available to students in grade 6 or below. These restrictions therefore violate students’ First Amendment rights and are facially unconstitutional.”
In his ruling, Locher set out what precisely what portions of the law are, and are not, enforceable:
— Detailed instruction banned: School districts and educators may not provide mandatory lessons or instruction to students in grade 6 or below that include detailed explanations or normative views on “gender identity” or “sexual orientation.”
— Neutral references allowed: School districts and teachers may provide mandatory lessons or instruction to students in grade 6 or below that contain neutral references to gender identity or sexual orientation. The lessons and instruction simply cannot focus on those topics. Teachers may make other neutral references to any gender identity and any sexual orientation during classroom instruction — for example, by referring to their partner even if the individual is of the same sex.
— Student groups allowed: Students in grades 6 and below must be allowed to join Gender Sexuality Alliances, or GSAs, and other student groups related to gender identity and/or sexual orientation.
— Promotion of student groups allowed: School districts and educators must be permitted to advertise GSAs and other student groups that relate to gender identity or sexual orientation to all students, including those in grade six and below, to the same degree as they might promote any other student group.
— Parental notification allowed in some cases: State officials and school districts may inform parents when a student asks for an accommodation in the form of a pronoun that’s at odds with their gender listed in school records, but they may not do so to any other student requests for an accommodation.
“We’re pleased that our clients, Iowa families and students, can look forward to the next school year without facing the harms of this unconstitutional law,” said Nathan Maxwell, senior attorney at Lambda Legal. “This ruling acknowledges that Iowa students and teachers have experienced real harm from this law. The court agreed with us that the latitude afforded the state to determine school curricula does not empower lawmakers to erase any mention of LGBTQ+ people altogether from schools, nor to put students in harm’s way for failing to meet ambiguous and arbitrary standards for gender expression. Lastly, the court here makes it clear, yet again, that banning books with LGBTQ+ content or censoring inclusive messages for LGBTQ+ students is unacceptable.”
“This is an important win for our clients and others harmed by this overreaching law,” said Thomas Story, ACLU of Iowa staff attorney. “The federal district court has blocked the state from enforcing many of the worst aspects of Senate File 496. Under this order, Iowa teachers no longer can be disciplined simply because their classroom contains a Pride flag or their library contains books with LGBTQ+ characters. Students of all ages are once again free to join GSAs and to promote them to their classmates.”

Why it’s still controversial,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/05/graduation-regalia-california/,Many school districts require students to undergo a lengthy process if they want to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation. A new bill would eliminate those obstacles.,"In summary
Many school districts require students to undergo a lengthy process if they want to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation. A new bill would eliminate those obstacles.


Eight years ago, California passed a law requiring high schools to allow students to wear eagle feathers, abalone necklaces and other regalia at graduations. 
But so many schools — more than half, by one estimation — have thrown up roadblocks to implementing the law that one lawmaker has brought the issue back to the Legislature. 
“It’s very disappointing that even after all this time, some districts still aren’t compliant,” said Assemblyman James Ramos, a Democrat from San Bernardino, who’s sponsoring the current bill. “We hope this bill gets us where we need to be.”
Ramos’ bill, AB 1369, eliminates the pre-approval process for students seeking to wear any type of cultural regalia at graduations, Native American or otherwise. Fifty-six percent of high schools allow students to wear regalia but only if they get advance permission, sometimes weeks before the ceremony, according to a 2024 study by the American Civil Liberties Union and California Indian Legal Services.
Schools say they need a pre-approval process — for all students, not just Native American students — because they want to ensure graduation adornments are respectful and appropriate. Students of other backgrounds also occasionally opt for adornments, such as kente cloths, and have to undergo the same approval process.

The bill, which passed the Assembly and is now working its way through the Senate, applies to any form of cultural regalia, although its definition of “cultural” is vague: “Cultural means recognized practices and traditions of a certain group of people.” That ambiguity is why a pre-approval process is necessary, some school districts say.
Native students, their families and tribes say it should be their decision as to what’s appropriate tribal attire, not the school district’s. They also say the approval process is too far in advance of the ceremony; often, students receive their regalia on the day of the event, sometimes as a gift from a grandparent or tribal elder. Showing up at graduation unsure of whether you’ll be allowed to wear a cherished piece of regalia can be nerve-wracking and embarrassing, Native students have said.
‘Proud to be Native’
Jennie Rocha, a freshman at Oregon State University, said she was nervous last year when she arrived at her graduation ceremony at Clovis North High wearing a Comanche stole that the school had initially denied.
The stole, provided by the tribal headquarters in Oklahoma, was inscribed with “we the people” in English and Comanche. When Rocha first applied for approval to wear it, she was denied. But after her father complained to the school board and local media reported on the dispute, the school granted approval.      
“I wanted to wear it because I feel like everything I have is because of the Comanche. I wouldn’t be able to go to college without their support,” Rocha said. “I’m proud to be Native and I wanted to show that.” 
Although there may have been delays and initial denials, Clovis Unified hasn’t ultimately stopped a student from wearing cultural adornments at graduation, said district spokesperson Kelly Avants. The district stands by its approval process as a way to minimize disruptions on the day of the graduation and screen out potentially offensive adornments.
Not having an approval process “creates an extremely vulnerable position for school districts and hinders the ability of staff to protect students from the trauma that comes from cultural appropriation, or a situation where someone intending to mock or harm a race or culture is able to do so because school administrators are not allowed to validate adornments,” Avants said in an email.

In Rocha’s case, the district initially denied the request because staff weren’t clear on personal elements of the stole and wanted to check with Comanche tribal leaders, Avants said. That caused a delay before the district ultimately approved the stole, she said.
The Association of California School Administrators hasn’t taken a position on Ramos’ bill, but their attorneys apparently agree with Clovis’ stand. 
“Districts have to have some parameters, otherwise you’re going to end up with a free-for-all on the night of graduation,” attorney Sloan Simmons said in an April podcast advising the state’s school administrators. “That’s the only rational way to handle this.”
The California Department of Education formed a task force to study the issue. The task force was supposed to create a report for the Legislature by April 2023, but it hasn’t yet. Meanwhile, the Department of Education is advising school districts to consult with local tribes if they opt to have a pre-approval process for regalia.
Trump’s anti-DEI orders
Another potential barrier to graduation regalia is President Donald Trump’s announcement in February that the federal government would withhold school funding to districts that have diversity policies and programs, specifically mentioning graduation ceremonies. A judge temporarily blocked the order last month, saying it was overly vague, and California more recently filed a separate lawsuit to stop the order. 
Meanwhile, confusion persists over any school policy that singles out or gives special treatment to a particular ethnic group.
Heather Hostler, executive director of California Indian Legal Services and a member of the Hoopa Valley tribe in Humboldt County, said she’s not worried about Ramos’ bill defying Trump’s order because recognized tribes are sovereign nations over which the federal government has no authority, she said.
The push for tribal regalia started as a way to tout the accomplishments of Native students, whose graduation rate — 80% — lags behind the state average of 87%. It’s also a way to strengthen Native culture by raising awareness and giving Native communities something to rally around, Ramos said.
“When someone graduates, it’s a big deal,” Ramos said. “The whole tribal community comes together. It makes sense that you’d be gifted something for your accomplishment.”
History of discrimination
Other recent laws, many by Ramos, have also addressed the treatment of Native Americans in K-12 schools. One law bans Native American school mascots. Another updates history curriculum to include the genocide of Native Californians. 
These laws are meant to help reverse more than a century of discrimination against Native students in California schools, said Morning Star Gali, founder and executive director of Indigenous Justice, an advocacy group.
Until the 1970s, many Native young people were sent to boarding schools where they were forced to abandon their language and culture. History curriculum often glamorizes the Mission and Gold Rush eras, when Native tribes suffered devastating losses.

In light of that, wearing tribal regalia at graduations “should not be a contentious issue,” Gali said. “Our young people deserve to walk with dignity and pride. To deny them that is a continued form of cultural extermination.”
Ethan Molina, a senior at Clovis West High School and a member of the Pascua Yaqui tribe, got district approval to wear an eagle feather on his mortarboard at graduation next month. The feather was a gift at a recent powwow. 
But he did not get permission to wear a sash embroidered by his aunt for the occasion. The sash reads “Class of 2025,” sewn in burgundy, blue, orange and red, significant colors for the tribe.
“I was confused,” Molina said. “It’s not political or anything. I didn’t really get why they’d deny it.”
His mother complained to the district and they’re waiting to hear a response. Meanwhile, Molina is just eager to graduate.
“I’m happy I get to wear the eagle feather,” he said. “But I’m also pretty excited about leaving school.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425-Native-American-Regalia-LV-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

In a May 9 letter from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Darren Olson, the institute’s grants management officer, said the president determined that the Digital Equity Capacity Program was created and administered using “unconstitutional racial preferences.”The Vermont Community Broadband Board is exploring legal options to oppose the cancellation and has contacted the State Attorney General’s Office, according to its website.“Without targeted investments in digital access and literacy, many Vermonters will be unable to access the resources necessary for job training, career advancement, and economic mobility, ultimately deepening existing disparities and limiting opportunities for economic growth,” the board’s digital equity officer, Britaney Watson, said in the release.Vermont’s implementation of the Digital Equity Act, passed under the Biden administration, would provide devices for people facing financial barriers, as well as online training programs to prepare Vermonters for remote work. The program would have also awarded subgrants to local organizations working to provide internet accessibility throughout the state, according to the release.A Sept. 30th study by the Center on Rural Innovation found that rural areas with higher broadband adoption and more small broadband service providers have stronger, more dynamic local economies. They reported that rural counties with fiber broadband adoption rates of over 80% have significant advantages over those with low adoption, including 213% higher business growth, higher self-employment growth, GDP growth and per capita income growth.The broadband board said in the release that it will continue to work with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and Vermont’s congressional delegation to determine their next legal, political and programmatic steps in continuing their digital equity efforts. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal government cancels Vermont’s $5.3 million digital equity grant.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/womens-rally-9-20241102-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

It’s the latest move by the gun-rights group in its four-year-battle to override the 2018 Florida law that bans 18-to-20-year-olds from purchasing long guns.
The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the legal challenge by the NRA in March, two years after a three-judge panel similarly ruled against the organization. The Florida Legislature passed and then-Gov. Rick Scott signed the law shortly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said after that ruling that his office would not defend the law if in fact the NRA filed an appeal with the high court.
“Notwithstanding CA11’s opinion today, I believe restricting the right of law-abiding adults to purchase firearms is unconstitutional,” Uthmeier said on X on March 14, adding that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reached the same conclusion. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
The NRA’s petition for certiorari calls upon the justices to review the split among federal circuit courts over whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have ruled that they do, while the Tenth and Eleventh circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
The Florida House in March passed a bill (HB 759) that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third straight year the chamber has done so, but both times the legislation failed to be come law because the proposal never moved in the Florida Senate.

Most of the clients had gone to work.Rows of double bunk beds packed two tight rooms with yellow walls and low ceilings at 187 Church St. One room provides 28 beds for single male adults and the other has eight beds available for female adults, and there are a couple of bathrooms with showers. Each of the beds has a number that corresponds to a locker in the hallway. There is a common area downstairs with some chairs, tables, two washer-dryers, a TV and a makeshift kitchen.Makeshift is how the shelter has operated for four decades, while homelessness and the need for safe, temporary housing has only grown.In the last federal fiscal year (October 2023 – September 2024), the Waystation, as the night shelter is called, served 159 unique individuals. Jonathan Farrell, executive director of the nonprofit that provides a wide array of housing and shelter services and advocates for long-term solutions to end homelessness, said 30 of those individuals were chronically homeless.“We are seeing unprecedented numbers of folks who are unhoused and sleeping rough in our communities,” he said.With 2,500 square feet over two floors, the night shelter has long outgrown the space in a city and state that has continued to see more and more people experiencing homelessness.Jonathan Farrell, the executive director of the Committee on Temporary Shelter, at the COTS Waystation shelter in Burlington on Friday, May 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont’s rate of homelessness ranks fourth in the nation and increased by nearly 5% between early 2023 and early 2024, according to the most recent annual point-in-time count, a federally-mandated tally of unhoused people taken on one night in January. Over the last few years, state leaders have restricted Vermont’s motel voucher program, limiting the back-up shelter option as homelessness has grown. Meanwhile, a bill that could overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is making its way through the Legislature.In Chittenden County alone, there are “a solid 250 to 300” who are unhoused, Farrell estimated.While the Waystation has been a lifeline for many seeking shelter at night, the aging facility does not meet current needs and has been on COTS’ agenda for improvement. In January, the organization acquired 58 Pearl St. — the former social security building -– and  work has begun to create a more modern, spacious, ADA-compliant night shelter there, Farrell said.The 7,361 square foot property will triple the space available in the current Waystation and provide beds for up to 56 adults, allowing COTS to expand its shelter services by 55%, according to a recent press release.“We are really focused on the dignity of the space,” Farrell said.To do so, COTS needs money.Renovating the building, in partnership with Duncan Wisniewski Architecture and JA Morrissey Construction, is estimated to cost $2 million, the release states. COTS’ capital campaign for a new Waystation has raised $500,000 from the State of Vermont Office of Economic Opportunity and $600,000 from anonymous donors. The Hoehl Family Foundation has provided a $200,000 challenge grant and COTS is looking to raise another $200,000 in matching funds to open the new space.The Hoefl grant has donated the first $100,000 and plans to match it with a second $100,000 once the additional $200,000 has been raised, according to the release.“It’s not charity, it’s solidarity,” said Katharine Kostin, a Hoehl Family Foundation board member, in the release. “We believe we’re only as strong as our most vulnerable neighbors; therefore, we’re privileged to work with the community toward supporting the dignity of every person.”Besides providing critically needed beds and space, the new center will provide a better kitchen, more laundry options, six private bathrooms with showers, a break room, common areas, an office and intake space for community partners and service providers.“It could be a health care provider, a street outreach person, could be an EMT or a nurse to see one of our guests in a private setting for medical, mental health, really anything. So we’re really excited about that and partnering with other folks in the community to provide those services to our guests,” Farrell said.In addition to providing a safe, supportive environment, Farrell said the new Waystation will have a positive impact on downtown by providing 20 more beds. So “contributing to the Waystation campaign is a direct, tangible way for people in our community who want to be part of the solution to do so,” he said.“Our downtown is facing a crisis,” states a May 9 letter signed by more than 100 area businesses and sent to Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak. The letter cites “street harassment, visible drug use, and threatening behavior” among the reasons they say have contributed to less foot traffic and staff retention leading to recent closures. Businesses are increasingly having to work on managing overdoses, mental health issues, shoplifting and cleaning up downtown, the letter states, urging the city to do better with communication, security, cleanliness and restorative efforts.The former Wilson Hotel in Burlington houses the Committee on Temporary Shelter ’s (COTS) Waystation shelter and transitional housing.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerLooking forwardThe Church Street space that shares walls with the Wilson apartments will be converted to create more permanent housing available for COTS’ clients to transition into, he said. The red brick building it abuts houses 23 deeply affordable permanent housing rooms for low-income and formerly unhoused individuals. Many of the tenants have been there for more than two decades, although the average turnaround is about 7 years, according to Farrell.Originally home of the Mills brothers who published Burlington’s first newspaper — The Northern Sentinel -– and dominated the printing and publishing market in the first half of the 19th century, the building later housed a hotel. A faded blue sign -– The Wilson — still hangs off the corner of the red brick building, built around 1820. Inside, there are elaborate textured tin ceilings and exposed copper piping harkening to a bygone era.Open 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., the Waystation is much older than the organization that was started by volunteers in 1982. COTS acquired it to use as a shelter soon after with two early board members putting their own homes up as collateral, according to Farrell.On Thursday morning, some of the blankets on the double bunk beds in a cramped room were rumpled; some were neatly folded and set on pillows. And some of the grey-blue lockers in the hallway sported stickers: ‘I (red heart) Jesus’ and ‘Owl forest.’Most of their temporary owners will return to lay their heads down. Unlike the stereotypes that persist, more than 70% of them have day jobs, Farrell said. And many of them, he said, are looking forward to the new, improved Pearl Street Waystation, which is expected to open in December.Read the story on VTDigger here:  COTS seeks public help to fund new, expanded overnight adult shelter in Burlington.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/COTS-waystation-3-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

A recent move by Doña Ana County to sever ties with a troubled Southern NM utility prompted Kenney to applaud the statement and urge further changes to the utility. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s top environmental official made the rare move this week of wielding political capital instead of regulatory power, saying he has little confidence in a troubled water provider in the southern part of the state that has been dogged by ongoing violations in arsenic levels.
Environment Secretary James Kenney urged the city of Sunland Park to follow the lead of surrounding Doña Ana County and sever ties with the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority. An independent, third party should oversee the utility in the meantime, Kenney said.
“We’re weighing in at this point because we’ve had it,” Kenney told Source NM, and acknowledged that it is unusual for the state to speak on a water supplier’s governance. “While we’re exhausting our enforcement, our legal approaches, we have another approach: We have to speak about it.”
He encouraged the restructuring of the utility at the local level, saying the state has limited tools to address the chronic issues at CRRUA.
“We can continue to assess civil penalties, collect those civil penalties, take them to court, but it is difficult to sort of seek an injunction and say, ‘You’re no longer allowed to operate,’ because that means the community is without water for any purpose, including things like fire suppression,” Kenney said.
CRRUA serves approximately 19,000 people in the border city of Sunland Park, Santa Theresa and the southernmost portion of Doña Ana County, an area with naturally occurring high levels of arsenic in the groundwater. Sunland Park and Doña Ana County jointly operate the utility, which is governed by a seven-member board.
The area has long struggled with arsenic – which over the long term can cause cancer and skin lesions – in drinking water, with health reports and concerns over treatment plants ongoing for nearly a decade.
State investigators intervened following a series of water quality issues in November 2023.The New Mexico Environment Department found that CRRUA sent drinking water with arsenic to residents’ homes while its three arsenic treatment systems were “offline and bypassed” for more than a year, in addition to dozens of significant treatment, training and facility issues.
State officials say Doña Ana Co. water had ‘systemic failures by management’

CRRUA is facing an ongoing lawsuit for alleged civil rights violations in state district court, and is also scheduled for a June 17 public hearing in Santa Fe regarding its protest of NMED’s $251,580 fines.
In media releases and prior statements to Source NM, CRRUA officials said they have worked to reduce arsenic levels and continue repeating that water is safe to drink. Specifically, CRRUA reported on May 5 that it has addressed 98% of the issues raised in the December 2023 report.
CRRUA said recent tests showing arsenic levels above the limit at one treatment plant were found as part of its voluntary testing.
“These follow-up tests are for internal monitoring and public transparency only. They are not for compliance purposes,” CRRUA Executive director Juan Crosby said in a press release Thursday. “Only the quarterly tests NMED conducts are for compliance and according to the latest compliance tests, the Santa Teresa Industrial ATF remains NMED compliant.”
Kenney said CRRUA can simultaneously be improving on the past violations, improving training and monitoring but also failing to restore the water quality.
“But at the end of the day, the only metric that matters is the quality of the water and the safety of that water getting into people’s houses,” Kenney said.
Past and recent arsenic level violations
No known safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic exists, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a health-based limit on drinking water at 10 parts per billion.
On April 29, CRRUA reported an arsenic level of 12 parts per billion at the Santa Teresa Industrial Park plant. One week later, in a separate test shared with NMED, the same plant reported another violation of 12 parts per billion on May 6.
Kenney endorsed recommendations from community organizations asking for a health assessment and to supply arsenic testing strips or potentially additional sources of water.
In a May 7 press release, CRRUA said it would not provide test strips because it would violate the state’s anti-donation clause and that test strips contain “hazardous materials that require proper handling.”
Kenney said that “demonstrated an inability to understand the magnitude of the problem.”
“I don’t know why the concern about a one-time exposure to a test strip that may contain mercury is CRRUA’s greater concern than the arsenic in the water that’s hitting people’s homes,” Kenney said.
Daisy Maldonado, who has organized in the community at the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County, told Source NM she was surprised, but welcomed NMED’s endorsement of the recent demands the group issued to CRRUA.
“I would put it back on Secretary Kenney and if CRRUA says they cannot provide those types of services, then we’re going to look obviously to NMED to be a partner in providing funding for test strips, third-party water and that health assessment,” Maldonando said.
She said the opportunity to reshape CRRUA over the next four years will offer an opportunity for Empowerment Congress to build a utility that’s more responsive to residents.
“A new structure should be established that really serves, again, the community,” Maldonado said. “That the highest priority is safe, clean drinking water water that people can trust.”
CRRUA next steps likely to take years
Earlier this week, Doña Ana County took the first step in a yearslong process to separate itself from CRRUA’s current governance.
At the May 13 meeting, after an hour-and-a-half closed session, the Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners unanimously voted to send immediate notice to Sunland Park to start the termination process of the Joint Powers Agreement, a formal charter allowing multiple public bodies to work together. The agreement, renewed last year, requires either one of the parties to give four years notice.
Blame spirals as CRRUA governing record ‘misplaced’ and never sent to state

On Friday, Doña Ana County Commission Chair Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez told Source NM that the vote is a first step to force negotiations and correct customer dissatisfaction. He said the current agreement overrepresents Sunland Park on the board, and that termination is the only way to renegotiate the makeup of CRRUA’s governing board.
Schaljo-Hernandez emphasized that CRRUA will continue operating in the meantime, and that negotiations will begin very soon.
“We’re going to work towards making sure that every single person serviced by CRRUA has their water quality improved,” Schaljo-Hernandez said. “The county has the vision that we’re going to improve this for all users. We’re not saying to Sunland Park ‘we’re taking ours and you’re taking yours, good luck.’”
Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea told Source NM in a phone call that it’s too early to determine what the city will do, but did not commit to cutting ties with CRRUA.
“I don’t know what it will look like today or tomorrow,” Perea said. “No plans have been developed yet, this is still very early on in the process.”
When asked about recent arsenic level violations, Perea said he believes the utility is making progress.
“The steps that we’re taking are working and being able to detect these issues and we’re trying to correct it as soon as possible, rather than having to wait for the required state testing,” he said. “The utility has made its stride over the last year, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”
Further, Perea said more funding is needed for a successful water utility, not just form rate-payers, but from the state and federal government.
“This was done on the back of infrastructure in Sunland Park, and we haven’t received our fair share of funding in this part of the state,” he said. “I hope that in this process, the state can also have funding opportunities for us to tap into and address these issues that have existed or been deferred for a long time.”
The New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration secretary is required to approve all joint powers agreements, including any modifications.
In a statement Henry Valdez, the director of legislative affairs at DFA, said the secretary’s approval is “limited to reviewing for compliance to ensure the terms and conditions are applicable,” and that any amendments or modifications to an agreement would require the secretary’s approval.

Free.,"Trump move to deport Venezuelans violated due process, U.S. Supreme Court rules",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-move-deport-venezuelans-violated-due-process-us-supreme-court-rules,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday kept in place a block on the Trump administration's efforts to deport 176 Venezuelans in Northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.A majority of the justices found that President Donald Trump’s administration violated the due process rights of Venezuelans when the administration tried to deport them from North Texas last month by invoking the 18th-century wartime law. Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.“Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,” according to the decision.The justices did not determine the legality of the Trump administration using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans 14 and older with suspected ties to the gang Tren de Aragua.On his social media platform, Trump expressed his disapproval of the ruling.“THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” he wrote on Truth Social.The justices found that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals “erred in dismissing the detainees’ appeal for lack of jurisdiction,” and vacated that order, sending the case back.The Trump administration on Monday asked the high court to remove the injunction, arguing that detaining suspected members of Tren de Aragua poses a threat to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and staff.In a Wednesday response, the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit, warned that if the Supreme Court lifts its injunction, “most of the putative class members will be removed with little chance to seek judicial review.”In Friday’s order, the justices noted that because the Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act to send migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador, careful due process is needed.“The Government has represented elsewhere that it is unable to provide for the return of an individual deported in error to a prison in El Salvador…where it is alleged that detainees face indefinite detention,” according to the order, noting the wrongful deportation of Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.“The detainees’ interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty,” the court continued.Other rulingsOn April 18, the ACLU made an emergency application to the high court, asking to bar any removals under the Alien Enemies Act in the Northern District of Texas over concerns that the Trump administration was not following due process.Several federal judges elsewhere have blocked the use of the wartime law in their districts that cover Colorado, Southern Texas and Southern New York.A federal judge in Western Pennsylvania Tuesday was the first to uphold the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, but said those accused must have at least three weeks to challenge their removal.",,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As an anticipated reduction to the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments by the Trump administration looms, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren is calling for the monuments to be kept at their current sizes in the name of efficiency.
“In light of the current administration’s stated priorities on efficiency and reducing waste, we believe that maintaining the integrity of established monument boundaries supports those goals,” Nygren wrote in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, according to a post by the Navajo leader on X. “Changing the boundaries and reopening finalized planning processes would not only risk the loss of valuable progress but may also lead to inefficiencies, duplicative expenditures, and delays in implementing conservation strategies.”
The letter asks that no changes to the monuments’ sizes be made without a meaningful dialogue with “all tribal nations with ancestral ties to these lands.”

In his confirmation hearing, Burgum hinted at support for reducing the monuments and echoed Utah leaders’ criticism of use of the Antiquities Act to put protections on large areas of land.
Bears Ears has deep spiritual and cultural importance to a number of Indigenous peoples, including the Diné, or Navajo, Nygren said in his post, noting that like neighboring Grand Staircase it is a “revered landscape.”
The monuments in southeastern Utah have been a political football for multiple presidential administrations, starting with the establishment of Grand Staircase in 1996 by President Bill Clinton who used his power under the Antiquities Act, a law passed in 1906 that gives the president authority to declare national monuments to protect areas of cultural, historical and scientific significance.
President Barack Obama then used the Antiquities Act at the end of his term in 2016 to give monument status to Bears Ears, an area tribes had long lobbied to protect.
Both monuments were scaled back by President Donald Trump when he took office in 2017, cutting Bears Ears from 1.36 million acres to 1 million acres, and Grand Staircase-Escalante from 1.35 million acres to 229,000 acres.
In 2021, President Joe Biden restored the monuments to their original sizes, a decision Utah is challenging in court.
Meanwhile, polling indicates that 71% of voters favor maintaining Bears Ears as a national monument, while 74% support keeping Grand Staircase-Escalante as a national monument.

(Photo by Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)Yellowstone National Park wildlife staff trapped and euthanized a grizzly bear this week after a series of conflicts with human food sources and trash in the park’s most popular tourist areas.
According to a Wednesday press release from the park, the 11-year-old, male grizzly bear, estimated to weigh 400 pounds, had repeatedly sought out food sources near Old Faithful, the Nez Perce Picnic Area and the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot.
The griz developed a strategy to flip over 800-pound dumpsters, uprooted small bear-resistant trash cans from their concrete bases and “became increasingly food-conditioned,” which wildlife managers decided posed a safety risk in such a busy area fo the park. The decisions to euthanize the animal was made to ensure public safety and reduce the chances of other bears becoming habituated to human food.
“It’s unfortunate that this bear began regularly seeking out garbage and was able to defeat the park’s bear-resistant infrastructure,” Yellowstone Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther said in a press release. “We go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food. But occasionally, a bear outsmarts us or overcomes our defenses. When that happens, we sometimes have to remove the bear from the population to protect visitors and property.”

The last grizzly bear killed in a management action in Yellowstone was in the fall of 2017, when park officials removed a griz that was damaging tents and accessing human food in backcountry campsites near Heart lake.
Yellowstone National Park’s bear management plan provides bear-resistant food storage lockers in all campgrounds, food storage devices in all backcountry campsites, and bear-resistant garbage cans and lockers. Park officials remind all visitors that utilizing these bear safety measures remain crucial in ensuring public safety, and preventing wildlife from developing dangerous habits.
All of Yellowstone is bear country, from the trails in the park’s backcountry to the boardwalks and parking lots around Old Faithful. Visitor safety cannot be guaranteed, but visitors can play an active role in protecting themselves and the bears people come here to enjoy.
Park staff ask that anyone involved in a conflict with a bear, regardless of how minor, contact park officials or report it to a park ranger as soon as possible. If cell service is available, dial 911. The lives of other people, and the bear, may depend on it.

Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing records indicate that so far this year, at least 33 nursing homes have been cited for resident abuse or failing to properly screen job applicants for histories of criminal activity or abuse. In most of those cases, the homes were subjected to a state fine of $500.

Among the violators:
Grundy Care Center, Grundy: In January, the home was cited for failing to protect residents from mental and physical abuse. Inspectors reported that a nurse aide at the home had accepted money from a male resident, and had kissed, touched, and sent nude photos of herself via text to the man. The inappropriate interactions continued until the nurse aide resigned, inspectors determined. The resident told inspectors the aide had wanted him to move in with her so she could take care of him.
The administrator of the home later learned the relationship was sexual, with conduct occurring during and after the aide’s scheduled working hours. The nurse aide reportedly admitted that after she met the resident, the two exchanged phone numbers and she followed him on social media and would message him via text and Facebook Messenger. She allegedly said it evolved into a relationship and that “neither did something the other didn’t want.” She reportedly acknowledged the inappropriate physical touching happened during her working hours, but added, “It was just kissing, that’s all.”
The matter was referred to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services by the police. According to state inspectors, DHHS “rejected the report and closed the case.”
Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation, Des Moines: In January, a male resident’s son alerted the home to misappropriation of property. The resident’s son had installed a camera in his father’s room, which captured footage of a certified nurse aide entering the room at 2 a.m. while the resident slept and accessing a locked drawer containing the resident’s money. Later, it appeared $55 was missing from the drawer. The administrator confirmed for state inspectors that he watched the video and it was evident the worker unlocked the dresser with a key, picked up something and put it in her pocket.
Harmony Waterloo, formerly Promedica Skilled Nursing & Rehab, Waterloo: Earlier this month, this home was cited for failing to protect residents from abuse in the form of financial exploitation. Residents of the home reported they routinely gave the staff money, credit cards or debit cards to purchase pop for them from vending machines. After one resident was discharged, she received a phone call from her bank regarding a debit card payment for a $417 cellphone bill, which depleted her account. It was later determined the phone in question belonged to a nurse aide who worked at the facility. A check of that aide’s criminal history revealed a past charge of third-degree theft that had resulted in a deferred judgment.

– Registered nurse at Lakeside Lutheran Home in Emmetsburg, according to inspectors


Lakeside Lutheran Home, Emmetsburg: In February, this facility was cited for failing to protect residents from abuse. Workers alleged that a registered nurse had tried to check a male resident’s blood sugar and after the man attempted to bite the nurse, she told him, “If you bite me, I will knock all the teeth out of your mouth,” and then raised her hand as if to strike him. An aide reported that she verbally intervened and said, “Hey,” and nurse lowered her hand.
Silver Oak Nursing & Rehab Center, Marion: In March, the home was cited for failing to report the exploitation of a resident and the potential misappropriation of the resident’s medication. According to inspectors, one registered nurse at the home was responsible for administering the resident’s medication commonly used for erectile dysfunction, and 21 to 33 tablets were unaccounted for. The resident indicated he had tipped the nurse $5 or $10 for her birthday and that on occasion, he had kissed the nurse and believed he was in love with her.
Staff members had reported seeing the two hugging and kissing. A medication aide reported seeing the two together and seeing the nurse stick her tongue “down his throat,” and also indicated the nurse may have given the resident money for a phone. A county deputy later told an inspector that a backpack owned by the nurse contained a prescription-drug label for an erectile dysfunction drug that indicated it was prescribed to the resident in question. Inspectors concluded the home made no effort to separate the nurse from the resident while the medication issue and exploitation issue were investigated.
Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center, West Burlington: In April, this facility was cited for failing to report allegations of abuse. A nurse aide at the home had reported to administrators that another worker at the home had confronted a resident who had expressed concern for a fellow resident’s welfare, telling him not to worry about others and to “sit your f—ing a– down.”
The accused worker was also reported by another worker to have called a resident a “b—-” on many occasions. In one alleged incident, a resident was being showered by the accused worker and complained the water was too hot, to which the worker replied, “Shut the f— up.”
Tripoli Nursing & Rehab Center, Tripoli: In April, the home was cited for three staff members being verbally abusive or physically rough with residents. One resident told inspectors, “I don’t like the way (other residents) are being talked to. (The workers) have no compassion. They talk to them very demanding… It is not ethical. We are family here.” Another resident said one of the workers was upset with a colleague and so “she just kind of threw me in bed or pushed me in bed.” The resident said the staffer was rough with him but that he didn’t consider it abuse.
Rehabilitation Centers of Independence, West Campus, Independence: In April, this facility was cited for failing to report abuse. A former resident of the facility had reported that that he had transferred $22 to one of the home’s nurse aides via PayPal at the end of February, and had only been paid back $10.

House Bill 3532 aims to speed the process of removing offensive titles from remaining sites. (Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Oregon lawmakers aim to speed up the process for renaming dozens of creeks, lakes, mountains and other sites that still hold offensive names.
The Oregon Senate will soon take up House Bill 3532, which would have the Oregon Geographic Names Board — a group advised by the Oregon Historical Society — make a list of places with offensive geographic names within three years of the bill’s passage and determine new names in consultation with local governments and tribes.
Currently, anyone can send a suggestion to the board to rename a location. But it’s a lengthy process, Oregon Historical Society Kerry Tymchuk told the Oregon Capital Chronicle. After receiving a renaming suggestion, the board must tour the area, study its history and connect with tribes, local elected officials and landowners for their feedback, he said. Name changes ultimately require federal approval, too.
The Oregon Historical Society has already identified 107 locations across Oregon with offensive names that remain unchanged. Many of them include derogatory terms used to demean Black individuals, immigrants and Native American women — such as Squaw Creek in Douglas County, Chinaman Hat in Josephine County and Cannibal Mountain in Lincoln County.
The Oregon House already advanced the bill in a 45-3 vote. The Senate may approve the bill in the coming days or weeks before reaching the governor’s desk.
 As Trump admin prioritizes ‘American Greatness,’ Oregon bill honors Indigenous history

Oregon is no outlier for having locations with derogatory names. In recent years, lawmakers in Texas, Maine and California have also tried passing legislation to rename places with offensive titles.
These state-level efforts gained momentum after the Biden administration in 2021 created a commission to remove offensive names from federal lands and declared the word “squaw” derogatory. It replaced 650 locations with that term with names honoring Native American history and culture.
But under the Trump administration, some U.S. lawmakers have doubts as to whether the federal government would approve name changes. In February, a Democratic Maine lawmaker withdrew a bill similar to Oregon’s, citing conflicting federal and local views, the Maine Morning Star reported.
The Maine lawmaker’s decision was based on President Donald Trump’s first day in office, when he issued an executive order overriding the U.S. Board of Geographic Names’ authority and called to rename the Gulf of Mexico to “Gulf of America” and revert the name of North America’s tallest peak, Denali, to Mount McKinley.
Denali means “the great one” in the Koyukon language, an Alaskan Native group that lives north of the peak. The federal government’s official name for it until 2015 was Mount McKinley — named after the country’s 25th President William McKinley who was from Ohio and had never visited or had ties to Alaska.
Oregon has taken steps to rename some of its geographic features with offensive titles. Most recently, the Oregon Geographic Names Board in September successfully led an effort to replace the names of two creeks that had racist terms used against Black individuals, the Oregonian reported.
Oregon’s House Bill 3532 builds on 2001 legislation led by then-Sen. Kate Brown to remove the word “squaw” from location names. Despite that legislation, the term is still used for dozens of Oregon locations. Brown, Oregon’s governor from 2015 to 2023, testified in support of the bill, saying the state has a lot more work to do to remove offensive, racist and derogatory names.
 Bill championed by Indigenous Oregon lawmakers

Indigenous women, like Rep. Tawna Sanchez, a Portland Democrat of Shoshone-Bannock, Ute, and Carrizo descent and the bill’s lead sponsor, said derogatory terms shouldn’t still exist on Oregon’s map.
“Renaming offensive locations in Oregon reflects our shared commitment to mutual respect, historical truth and creating a welcoming environment for all Oregonians,” Sanchez said. “My hope is that no one has to drive in any wonderful part of the state of Oregon and feel like they don’t belong there.”
Sanchez told the Capital Chronicle that the federal government would still have to approve the renaming of places with offensive titles.
The bill includes an amendment to uplift local control, she said, but for a name change to be approved, it would have to go through the Oregon Geographic Names Board. Then, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names makes the final call.
“Our hope is the federal government will act on the recommendation from the (Oregon board) that was made through a comprehensive process that reflects the will of Oregonians. Any result other than that would be pure politics,” Sanchez said.
The three Republicans who voted against the bill— Reps. Jami Cate of Lebanon, Virgle Osborne of Roseburg and Alek Skarlatos of Winston — did not explain their votes in the House and did not respond to Capital Chronicle.
Rep. Annessa Hartman, D-Gladstone, a cosponsor and member of the Snipe Clan of the Cayuga Nation, part of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, told her House colleagues that from a young age she’s known about the derogatory terms used against her and her community.
“It was up to us to just ignore them and just ignore the pain and the suffering that those words had caused to my people and our family,” she said on the House floor. “To see those still plastered across maps, rivers and street signs and now having my own children — I don’t want to continue that legacy of having them to just accept that that term is being used.”

(Photo obtained from Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality files)Russellville-based Denali announced Friday that it will stop depositing waste from chicken processing facilities in its Van Buren lagoon by the end of 2025.
The announcement came after dozens of Fort Smith-area residents spoke at a public hearing held by the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality Thursday evening. Both residents and elected officials described how odors from the lagoon, and from Denali’s land application operations, had negatively affected their lives and businesses, and the region as a whole.
“Denali will discontinue bringing material to the storage facility this year,” Denali CEO Todd Mathes said in an emailed press release.
“Disposition of the material at the site will be determined after Dec. 31, 2025. Denali is currently executing its long-term plan for alternative storage capacity and long-term infrastructure solutions throughout the region, which will allow for the closure of the open-air facility in Crawford County,” Mathes said. “Working with regulatory officials to obtain permits and permit modifications are required in order to completely close the storage facility in a timely manner.”
Denali told the Advocate earlier this month that “we have not committed to an exact date,” citing the need to obtain additional storage and permits.
Denali said it would provide notifications to local officials before the lagoon is cleaned out. A previous clean-out of millions of gallons of sludge from the lagoon in 2024 led to dozens of complaints about odor to DEQ from Fort Smith residents.
However, the waste recycling company emphasized that Sebastian and Crawford counties remained “important operational areas” for Denali due to the number of food processors in the region. 
The press release did not address concerns of some critics about the volume of waste being applied to fields in the area nor how land applications were affecting residents living nearby.
Crawford County has one of the highest number of land application permits in the state, with at least eight. Most of the Crawford County permits are held by Denali. HydroAg Environmental is another permit holder.

SPRINGFIELD — On May 19, 1875, a Cook County jury handed down a verdict in a case concerning the health and welfare of Mary Lincoln, widow of the former president who had been assassinated a decade earlier.

After listening to only a single day of testimony, the 12 men on the jury signed the standard verdict form stating simply that they “are satisfied that said Mary Lincoln is insane, and is a fit person to be sent to a State Hospital for the Insane …”

The case had been brought to court by her surviving son, Robert Todd Lincoln, then just 31 years old and a successful practicing attorney in Chicago. At his request, the court ordered her committed to the Bellevue Place Sanitarium in Batavia, west of Chicago, and named him conservator of her estate for a period of one year, based on the finding that she was at the time incapable of managing her own affairs.

But Mrs. Lincoln would not spend a full year in the facility. With the help of two of her closest and only remaining friends, James and Myra Bradwell, of Chicago – and against the strong protests of Robert Lincoln – Mary Lincoln would be released after only four months to the custody of her sister in Springfield, Elizabeth Edwards.

The subject of Mary Lincoln’s mental health has long been the subject of public debate. Was she, in fact, a danger to herself and others, and was her son truly acting in her best interests? Or was Robert Lincoln, as his mother would sometimes allege, scheming to shove her aside in order to take over her money and property?

Now, 150 years after her commitment, a newly rediscovered collection of correspondence between Mrs. Lincoln and her friends and family – letters long assumed to have been lost or destroyed – shed new light on the nature of her illness as well as the nature of her relationships with the few friends and family she had left by that time.

[caption id=""attachment_67091"" align=""alignleft"" width=""289""] “The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow, As Revealed by Her Own Letters,” edited by Jason Emerson and published by Southern Illinois University Press.[/caption]

“The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow, As Revealed by Her Own Letters,” was compiled by historian Jason Emerson and was recently released by Southern Illinois University Press.

“People have always wondered if these missing letters, if they showed that, in fact, she was perfectly sane, that her son Robert did actually railroad her, bribe the judge and jury because he wanted to steal her money,” Emerson said in a podcast interview with Capitol News Illinois. “And they do not show that at all. They show that Mary thought that's what was happening – which, in my opinion, and the opinions of psychiatrists I've consulted – that was one of her delusions, that everyone was trying to steal her money, not just Robert.”

The book was actually first compiled a century ago by Myra Helmer Pritchard, granddaughter of James and Myra Bradwell, and they were scheduled for publication in 1927, first in installments in the magazine “Liberty,” and then as a book.

Before the publication, however, Pritchard, as a courtesy, offered to show them to Mary Harlan Lincoln, widow of Robert Lincoln, who had just died the year before. Although she was initially agreeable to the project and even offered to add additional information, after reading the manuscript, Mary Harlan Lincoln withdrew her consent and launched a series of legal efforts to suppress their publication.

Pritchard eventually agreed to hand over the material and never publish them in any form, in exchange for a payment of $22,500.

Emerson’s book recompiles that material and presents it as it was intended to be published in 1927, including Pritchard’s comments on the letters. But it also includes Emerson’s own annotations and footnotes that provide context, as well as clarifications and corrections to some of Pritchard’s commentaries.

The letters reveal her to be lonely, occasionally depressed and at times desperate for companionship. But on their surface, do not necessarily portray someone of an unsound mind, especially considering the traumas she had endured through much of her life.

“Pray for me that I may be able to leave such a place as this,” she wrote to Myra Bradwell on Aug. 3, 1875. “Let me see Judge Bradwell. I beg you to come on Friday morning. I should like to see Dr. Evarts. I feel I must have some further conversation with him. Write me, your heartbroken friend, frequently, daily. But come to me. Will you kindly bring out some samples of black alpaca a best quality without luster and without cotton. Also some samples of heavier black woolen goods.”

The book is Emerson’s second work on the subject of the lost letters, which he uncovered in 2005. He found them locked away in a trunk that had once belonged to one of Robert Lincoln’s personal attorneys, Frederick Towers.

Capitol News Illinois · A new perspective on Mary Todd Lincoln


Using those letters and a wealth of other material, Emerson wrote his first book on the subject, “The Madness of Mary Lincoln,” in 2007.

In that book, Emerson cites a modern psychiatric expert who theorized that Mary Lincoln suffered from what would likely be diagnosed today as bipolar disorder.

“And he told me that today, Mary would be committed involuntarily for probably about seven days,” he said. “Doctors would look at her. They'd give her medication, and she'd be fine today, as long as she took the medication.”

“But back then, they didn't have that,” Emerson said. “But if you look at her whole life, it's very clear the incidence of bipolar disorder, or what used to be called manic depressive illness, where she's high and she's low, and she's wonderfully loving and horribly mean. Her spending could be considered a manic action. She was depressed a lot. So it's clear throughout her whole life.”

After her release, Mary Todd Lincoln lived a relatively quiet life, although she remained plagued by both psychiatric and physical ailments. She died in 1882 at the age of 63. She is buried next to her husband at the Lincoln Tomb in Springfield, along with three of their sons: Edward, William and Thomas.

Robert Lincoln went on to lead a distinguished career of his own. In addition to his legal career, he served as secretary of war under President James Garfield and continued in that post under President Chester A. Arthur after Garfield’s assassination. He also served as minister to Great Britain in the Benjamin Harrison administration. He died in 1926 at age 82.

The report, released Thursday following an independent seven-month investigation, also asserts that Connecticut State Police committed an “unexplained failure” by taking 15 months to seek arrest warrants for Anthony Mastrangelo, a town employee who allegedly sexually assaulted four girls, despite having probable cause to do so. During that 15-month period, a fifth victim was allegedly sexually assaulted. 
The report, prepared by former Superior Court Judge Robert L. Holzberg, now with the Pullman & Comley law firm, comes as Connecticut legislators are in the midst of debating a controversial bill that would require municipal camps to be licensed by the state. Currently, camps in Connecticut that are run by towns and cities receive no state oversight and aren’t required to comply with even basic regulations that private camps must abide by, like conducting staff background checks and testing water quality. 
“If this [report] isn’t a manifesto for the need to pass Senate Bill 6 this session, I don’t know what is,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, whose district includes Bethany, told The Connecticut Mirror. “We may never have a better reason, detailed for us in black and white. I want to use the word ‘shocking’ to describe what was uncovered in Bethany, but it goes beyond that. The callousness. The disregard. Utter incompetence. Basic, basic safety rules not adhered to. They can’t find reports and training manuals. And I love my cities and towns, but I wonder — what if we scratched a little deeper into more municipal programs? What would we find? Would we find excellence? Competence? Or more problems?”
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition when a similar bill was proposed in 2023. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
But, according to the report, Bethany’s Parks and Recreation Department was in disarray at the time Cofrancesco provided written testimony against the bill, and she didn’t know if counselors there received background checks or safety training at all. According to the report, the department “had no filing or record-keeping system, written safety policies, or documented training protocols for its staff.” According to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024.
Cofrancesco did not respond to a request for comment. When asked for comment by reporters after the report came out on Thursday, she responded, “Not right now, thank you.”
State Police Col. Daniel Loughman said in a statement that he agreed with the report’s claim that Cofrancesco did not demand answers about the investigation before May 2024, and that Cofrancesco never sought a meeting with the state police after May 2024.
But the statement did not address the report’s concerns about the 15-month span between the beginning of the investigation and Mastrangelo’s arrest.
Gina Teixiera, a member of the Bethany Board of Selectmen, told the CT Mirror that  Cofrancesco should resign.
“I feel that it’s a fiduciary duty, given the liability she’s created for this town,” she said.
In a statement, Teixiera and Robert Brinton, the other member of the board of selectmen, said Cofrancesco’s behavior was “inexcusable.”
“The report reveals a First Selectwoman more concerned about her own self-interest and that of her family and friends, including the alleged child sex-abuser, than the safety of the children in our community,” the statement reads. “This is inexcusable. Her repeated deception of not only the members of the Board of Selectmen, but also all of the residents of the Town of Bethany, at meeting after meeting, is a betrayal from a person in a position of trust.”
Cofrancesco’s “leadership failures have harmed the Town of Bethany and exposed us to legal liability on multiple fronts,” it continues. “Town residents deserve answers about why municipal laptops and phones were deleted in violation of Connecticut Freedom of Information statutes. 
“Also, the residents of the Town of Bethany need answers about the unexplained, lengthy delay by the Connecticut State Police to make any arrest even after having sufficient probable cause in a case involving child sex abuse. This delay was supported by Paula Cofrancesco, who failed to communicate with the Connecticut State Police in any way, to request any information about the matter even after falsely saying she had tried to get answers from them many times,” the statement reads.
‘That claim is contradicted’
The report begins its timeline in December of 2022, when Bethany superintendent Kai Byrd learned that a parent would be filing a report with the Department of Children and Families (DCF) against Mastrangelo, a camp counselor, substitute teacher, after school program employee and frequent babysitter for local children. 
According to the report, Cofrancesco was informed by David Merriam, the administrative lieutenant for the Bethany Resident Trooper’s Office, of the nature of the allegations against Mastrangelo and that the Connecticut State Police were also investigating the matter. But after the allegations became public in 2024, Cofrancesco repeatedly insisted that she did not know the sexual nature of the allegations until much later. 
The report alleges that she was lying. 
“Corroborating e-mails and text messages [demonstrate] that the First Selectman, despite her denials, knew the specific nature of the allegations against Mastrangelo as early as December 23, 2022,” the report states.
“While the First Selectman still denies having actual knowledge … of the specific allegations against Mastrangelo, that claim is contradicted by multiple credible witnesses,” the report states.

The report indicates that, rather than alert the town about the allegations or fire Mastrangelo, Cofrancesco’s response was to keep quiet and ensure that Mastrangelo — a family friend — remained employed in the basement of Town Hall, adjacent to the Parks and Recreation complex, and later at her husband’s insurance firm. 
“Curiously, she acknowledged that she never attempted to speak to Mastrangelo about the allegations or reach out to DCF, the State Police, or Town Counsel about the allegations,” the report states.  
Cofrancesco also did not pursue any improvements of safety procedures in those programs after the allegations came to light and even denied requests from other staff members to install security cameras, according to the report. 
Even when Cofrancesco became aware that DCF had confirmed at least two allegations against Mastrangelo, she failed to “implement background checks of all Parks and Rec employees; direct an immediate and comprehensive review of Parks and Rec Programs and policies,” pursue safety measures for children, or even seek the advice of the town attorney, according to the report.

The report, which goes on for 28 pages and includes another 200 pages of appendices, was a massive undertaking for Holzberg, a retired judge of 32 years who has a reputation both as a skilled mediator and investigator. Holzberg also conducted independent investigations into sexual assault allegations at Stamford High School and the Bridgeport Archdiocese, where he identified 281 victims of sexual abuse by 71 priests dating back to 1953. 
For the Bethany report, Holzberg and his team of three lawyers spent seven months on the investigation and interviewed 48 witnesses and reviewed more than 125,000 emails and phone records. 
At one point, the former judge quoted a witness comparing Bethany to “Mayberry,” the fictional town in the 1960s-era Andy Griffith Show, where town employees are all related to each other. For example, the report said Cofrancesco is the cousin by marriage of the former Director of Parks and Recreation, Janice Howard; She is also the aunt by marriage of a Parks and Recreation Department employee, Anthony Cofrancesco, who was friends with Mastrangelo.
The report details concerns among other town staff about Mastrangelo’s continued employment and presence in town facilities. 
In the report, a transcript of a text message exchange between Howard and Cofrancesco shows that Howard didn’t want to be blamed for Mastrangelo’s continued work in a town facility after DCF and CSP launched their investigations. Howard writes, “you guys made the decision. Because that is how it happened and I want to make sure that is how it was relayed.”
The report also notes that Bethany Schools Superintendent Kai Byrd took immediate action after she learned that a report was to be filed with DCF, firing Mastrangelo as a substitute teacher and banning him from school property.

Holzberg notes that several parties were uncooperative with the Bethany investigation, including former leadership of the parks and recreation staff, whom the report accuses of deleting emails and text messages, and Connecticut State Police, which also denied Holzberg’s request to review its investigative file or provide an explanation for its delay in seeking warrants for Mastrangelo’s arrests. Cofrancesco also withheld text messages from Holzberg.
In a letter to Holzberg, Loughman cited the pending criminal case as to why police would not cooperate.
Holzberg concludes that, “the unexplained failure of the Connecticut State Police’s Bethany Troop I to seek arrest warrants for Mastrangelo in early 2023, despite having probable cause to initiate criminal proceedings arising from his assault of four victims, provided Mastrangelo an opportunity to commit a further assault in May 2024. The fifteen-month delay in seeking Mastrangelo’s arrests requires a full and candid explanation by the Commanding Officer of the CSP.”
Members of the community have called for Cofrancesco’s resignation since the report was released, including Amy Lestinsky, the mother of the fifth victim. Lestinsky helped Cofrancesco campaign for first selectman back in 2021.
“It’s super disheartening, because here I was supporting someone who I thought had the moral integrity and the know-how, and it’s all come out in black and white,” Lestinsky said. “She has none of them, and to me is not fit to run the town. I wanted her to resign last year and now, more than ever, I think she really should step down.”
Amy Rushlow, chair of the Bethany Democratic Town Committee, wrote in a post on Facebook that Cofrancesco’s “ineptitude, malfeasance, and gross neglect have no place in Bethany, especially as its leader. We call on Paula Cofrancesco to resign immediately. Our children and our town deserve better.”
Sen. Ceci Maher, co-chair of the state legislature’s Committee on Children, which has advocated for the camp licensing bill, said the report offers a clear example of why such oversight is under consideration by lawmakers.
“Not all camps operate like this. I’m hopeful that this is the exception. But something horrible happened in Bethany, and across 169 municipalities, with dozens upon dozens of different parks and recreation departments operating at different levels, it could happen again. It’s clear to me that we can do better. I look forward to seeing us do better.”

(United Methodist Health Ministry Fund/KU School of Nursing)TOPEKA — Maternity care is becoming out of reach for many in rural Kansas counties, where birth rates are higher than in urban areas, hospitals face closure and obstetrics services are few and far between.
The new report from the University of Kansas School of Nursing and Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund examined Kansas’ maternity care deserts, or counties without nearby access to prenatal and obstetrics care.
The findings “paint a stark picture of the current landscape of access to maternal health,” said David Jordan, president and CEO of the health fund, which commissioned and funded the report. The report was based on statewide data from 2022-2024.
“The data also emphasize the critical importance of addressing this challenge before it gets worse, as well as recognizing that the location of services is one piece of the puzzle,” he said.
More than 40% of Kansas counties don’t have any maternal care services, and most Kansans live 30 miles or more from a high-risk delivery facility, the report found. Plus, most rural counties in the state do not have an obstetrician/gynecologist.
In western Kansas, Grant and Wallace counties, which sit on or near the Kansas-Colorado border, have the highest birth rates in the state. Wallace County, home to roughly 1,700 people, has no hospitals, birthing centers or facilities offering prenatal services. The closest facility offering inpatient maternity care is at least 50 miles away. In Grant County, maternity care isn’t available at existing facilities, the report found, and the closest maternity care facility is at least 24 miles away. 
Labor and delivery services and high-risk care are most difficult to access, the report found. About 30% of Kansas ZIP codes are 100 miles or more from high-risk pregnancy services.
Medicaid, the joint federal and state public health insurance program, pays for about 40% of all births in Kansas. After delivery, mothers are eligible for continued coverage for a year if they make an annual income less than or equal to 171% of the federal poverty level, which amounts to $47,453 or less for a family of four. 
The report also revealed the unrecognized costs associated with providing maternity care, which requires the constant presence and attention of teams of nurses and clinicians. Reimbursement rates through public insurance programs can be lacking. 
Addressing maternal care deserts requires sound data, said Karen Weis, the lead author of the report and dean of KU School of Nursing-Salina.
“Kansas legislators, health care systems, foundations, professional organizations and educational institutions are all working hard to address the concerns of access to care and the health care workforce,” she said.
The report highlight four priorities to improve the state’s maternal health care. Providers could use telehealth more frequently as a way to expand maternal health options. Rural areas could create regional models of care so providers can more easily collaborate.
The Legislature could increase reimbursement rates for maternity care services to ease affordability concerns and retain care providers.
“Eighty-six percent of Kansas hospitals experienced a loss of services in 2023, 63% are at risk of closing and 32% are at risk of immediate closure,” the report said.
The report encouraged further engagement and research to maximize scarce resources.
Jordan said Kansas needs new, innovative solutions “to complete the puzzle in order to provide women, children and families across the state with better access to the services they need to thrive.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/25_SON_Access-to-Care_SM_Facilities_Inpatient-OB-e1747421344479-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-16 17:07:53.463306

As the state Legislature is in the process of crafting the next state budget, economists from the University of Michigan and other experts presented research and estimations Friday on the trajectory of the national and state economies, looking at the potential impacts of federal tariffs, unemployment rates and tax revenue in order to inform lawmakers’ decisions in the budget-making process.
As the Trump administration proceeds with implementing high tariffs on imports in order to encourage consumption of domestic goods, and other countries threaten retaliatory tariffs, Yinuo Zhang and Gabriel Ehrlich of the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, or RSQE out of the University of Michigan, told state budget officials that Michigan is likely to be dramatically impacted.
With much of the Trump administration’s actions varying day-to-day, Ehrlich said job loss estimates due to tariffs are “very uncertain”, but as things stand now, Michigan could lose 13,000 jobs as a result of tariffs on the automotive industry as manufacturing costs increase and many of the vehicles Michigan produces see a $6,200 average increase in prices.
“Uncertainty” is the word of the day State Treasurer Rachael Eubanks said in reviewing the presentations that were given
“We are not an island. There are real and serious implications to federal trade and tax policy actions that are impacting each state uniquely,” Eubanks said. “So, we are monitoring the latest federal development continuously, which sometimes seems to change on the hour, and it can be challenging to keep up with the latest developments when you’re in the business of forecasting the revenues in the economy.”
Additionally, the result of the meeting of budget leaders of the Legislature and state called the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference, or CREC, was that lawmakers will have less funds to work with than previously estimated in the January CREC meeting.
The consensus was with state revenues on the decline, lawmakers will have about $320 million less to appropriate in the 2025-26 fiscal budget.
Analysts project modest 2025 economic growth in Michigan, while state and school revenues are up

Tensions around formulating a state budget are already high in the partisanly split state Legislature as communication between leaders of the Republican-majority House and the Democratic-majority Senate remains minimal while Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) sues House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) over Hall’s refusal to send bills leftover from the previous session to the governor’s desk for approval.
Since the current legislative session began in January, following two years of bicameral Democratic control of the Legislature, lawmakers have only gotten two bills signed into law to retain tipped wages in Michigan and implement new sick time requirements.
Earlier this week Michigan Senate Democrats passed their nearly $84.6 billion proposal for the state’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget, surpassing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s proposed $83.5 billion proposed budget.
The Senate plan, which is part of the negotiation between the House and governor in order to create a state budget, invests in schools, public safety and infrastructure, a news release from Senate Democrats Wednesday asserts.
“Our budget puts Michigan families first — plain and simple,” Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said in the news release. “It’s a reflection of what we’ve heard from residents across the state: they want good schools, safe communities, access to health care, and real opportunities to build a better life.” 
The House is still working out the details of its plans, but following CREC on Friday, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said in a news release budget negotiations are shaping up to be a battle for which Democrats are going to blame the Trump administration for their own thoughtless actions.
“The Senate’s own fiscal analysts are saying the budget the Democrats passed just two days ago puts Michigan into a billion-dollar deficit. And they were so proud of rushing it through without thinking,” Hall said in the release. “I’ve been telling you from the beginning that we’re negotiating with unserious people. House Republicans are going to have to be the adults in the room once again.”

(Mark Wilson | Getty Images)Unions representing workers laid off at federal health and oversight agencies are heading to Washington D.C. next week to protest past and continued cuts to their workforces by the federal government’s new Department of Government Efficiency.
In a news release Friday, the American Federation of Government Employees — which represents workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — said it will join other labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, in a protest outside the federal Department of Health and Human Services headquarters at noon on Thursday, May 22.
The unions are demanding four things, per the release:

Full reinstatement of all laid-off employees
Restoration of funding to all affected programs
An end to “retaliatory and offsetting” layoffs
Direct engagement with union leadership before any future restructuring at the federal level

The labor moves comes as several layoffs and reductions in force at the federal level under DHHS have already been rolled back. Earlier this week, a federal judge ordered DHHS to reinstate all workers at NIOSH’s Division of Respiratory Health, including employees from the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program.
In Pennsylvania, NIOSH workers responsible for certifying respirators were also returned to work.
But still, hundreds of other NIOSH employees and workers from the CDC are still without jobs. Meanwhile, the work they did — some of which are the product of orders from Congress — is going unperformed.
Workers at NIOSH were first put on administrative leave in April through an agency-wide reduction in force. In early May, some were reinstated. Then they were put on leave again after only a few days. Now — through the federal court order issued in West Virginia last week — at least some workers are returning to the agency permanently.
More cuts in other departments, however, are scheduled to take effect between June and July.
The reductions in force from the federal government have been characterized as tools to reduce wasteful spending and promote efficiency within the organizations. The cuts, however, have led to numerous lawsuits, freezes in critical work, confusion and widespread concern from individuals who rely on that work to do their jobs safely.
“These layoffs are not targeting inefficiency, they are targeting science,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of AFGE Local 2883 in Atlanta, where the CDC is based. “Public health researchers and frontline scientists are being thrown out of their jobs while the country faces growing environmental, occupational and public health crises.”
Per the release from the AFGE, work that’s stopped includes research on toxicology, exposure to certain substances, mine safety, chemical hazards, the impact of workplace oversights and more.
Several of these services that are now going undone are congressionally mandated through the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Several labor unions filed suit on May 14 against the federal government, arguing that since the cuts are stopping work that is required by Congress, they are illegal.
That was the same successful argument used in West Virginia, where coal miners filed suit against the government due to cuts at NIOSH robbing them of congressionally-mandated protections against black lung disease. The judge in that case issued a temporary injunction ordering the full restoration of staff at NIOSH’s Division of Respiratory Health.

Free.,Abrego Garcia judge questions administration’s broad use of state secrets privilege,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-judge-questions-administrations-broad-use-state-secrets-privilege,,"GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A federal judge said Friday the Trump administration has “pretty broadly” invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information on its efforts — or, the judge indicated, a possible lack of effort — to return a wrongly deported Maryland man from a prison in El Salvador.President Donald Trump’s administration moved last month to invoke the so-called state secrets privilege to shield information about its process to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States after a top immigration official admitted his removal to a prison in El Salvador was an “administrative error.”The judge handling the case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, granted an expedited discovery process after she found last month that “nothing has been done” by the administration to return Abrego Garcia.She did not make a public order regarding the state secrets privilege Friday afternoon before closing her courtroom to the public to discuss sensitive matters with attorneys for Abrego Garcia and the Department of Justice.The state secrets privilege is a common-law doctrine that protects sensitive national security information from being released. The Trump administration has argued the need to invoke it in this case to protect diplomatic relationships.‘He’ll never walk free in the United States’During the public portion of Friday’s hearing, Xinis pressed the Department of Justice attorneys about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s comment that Abrego Garica “will not return” to the U.S.“That sounds to me like an admission that your client will not take steps to facilitate the return,” Xinis said. “That’s about as clear as it can get.”DOJ attorney Jonathan D. Guynn disagreed and said the Trump administration is complying with court orders. He said Noem’s comment meant that if Abrego Garcia was back in U.S. custody he would be removed either to another third country or back to El Salvador.“He’ll never walk free in the United States,"" Guynn said.He added that the Trump administration is “currently complying and we plan to comply.”Xinis said she disagreed, and then she clashed with Guynn over the legality of Abrego Garcia’s removal.Guynn said that he was lawfully deported.Xinis answered that she found months ago that Abrego Garcia was unlawfully detained and removed from the U.S.Few documents producedOne of the attorneys for Abrego Garcia, Andrew J. Rossman, said the Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege for 1,140 documents relating to the case. From that request, Rossman said his team received 168 documents, but 132 were copies of court filings and requests made by him and his team.Xinis seemed visibly stunned by Rossman’s report and had to clarify that his team had only received 36 new documents, which Rossman confirmed.Rossman said that none of the documents for which the government is invoking the state secrets privilege are classified.“There’s ways to do this right, and they haven't done it,” he said, noting that he has attorneys on his team who have security clearances and can review classified and sensitive information.Rossman said that he and his team are seeking answers to three questions: the status of Abrego Garcia, what steps the Trump administration has taken, if any, to facilitate his return, and the steps the federal government will take, if any, to comply with court orders.Guynn said the Trump administration received an update from El Salvador on Thursday that Abrego Garcia was in “good health” and had “even gained weight.""The U.S. Supreme Court ordered that the Trump administration must ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia.Rossman, said that it’s “deeply disturbing” that administration officials, including the president, have made public statements that contradict court orders directing the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.President Donald Trump has said he could easily pick up the phone and order El Salvador to return him but won’t because he believes Abrego Garica is a member of the MS-13 gang.Noem was pressed at a May 14 congressional hearing about a photo that appears altered to add letters across Abrego Garcia’s knuckles to indicate his inclusion in the gang. She said she was unaware of it.A federal judge in the District of Columbia, in a separate case regarding Trump’s use of an archaic wartime law for deportations, questioned Department of Justice attorneys on the president’s claim that he could order Abrego Garcia to be returned. The attorney admitted that the president sometimes overstates his influence abroad.El Salvador prisonAbrego Garcia has had protections from deportation since 2019, but he was one of nearly 300 men on three mid-March removal flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador known as CECOT.Abrego Garcia has been moved to a lower security prison, according to Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to the country last month to meet with Abrego Garcia and inquire with Salvadoran officials about why he is being held there.Those officials said Abrego Garcia was being held because of the agreement between the United States and El Salvador.The U.S. has a $15 million agreement with El Salvador's government to house immigrants removed from the U.S., mostly Venezuelans removed under the wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.

The Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is a national of El Salvador and in that country’s custody and the U.S. cannot force another government to return him. Hours before Friday’s hearing, dozens of protestors gathered outside the court, calling for Abrego Garcia to be returned to the U.S., as well as criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. U.S. Rep. Glenn Ivey, who represents the area in Maryland where Abrego Garcia and his family live, appeared outside the court and led chants calling for the release of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.“The president has to obey the orders of the Supreme Court,” Ivey said. “The Supreme Court has spoken here, and it's time for him to follow it and bring him home.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-16 17:07:53.463306

For a second year in a row, New York City and Los Angeles were among the cities with the most population growth last year as the nation’s largest cities continued to recover from devastating pandemic losses.
The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.

Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.




The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

The bill would initiate major changes to Vermont’s education finance and governance systems, setting in motion several years of transformation.

Phil Scott, speaks with Sen Seth Bongartz, D-Windham, right, chair of the Senate Education Committee, in a hallway at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA key Senate committee advanced the Legislature’s landmark education bill Thursday, but not before nearly every committee member vented their discomfort with the legislation. “I can’t remember ever feeling as bad about a vote as I do on this one, but it will move us forward,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, the Senate Finance Committee’s chair, told her colleagues after voting out H.454. The bill proposes generational changes to Vermont’s school governance and finance systems that would phase in over multiple years, including school district consolidation and a new education funding formula, but leaves open some key decision points for the future. Both chambers of the Legislature and Republican Gov. Phil Scott have made education reform the year’s key issue in response to last year’s double-digit average property tax increases, and all three drafted different versions of wide-ranging reforms. The Senate Finance Committee ultimately voted 5-2 to move H.454 forward. The entire Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week, and senators have signalled there may be amendments put forward on the floor. If the legislation passes, House and Senate members are expected to further negotiate over differences in a conference committee. The compromise version would then require majority approval in both chambers before being sent to the governor.Though the Senate’s current version departs from both the House’s and Scott’s packages, both chambers and the administration have broadly agreed the state should transition to a new education funding formula and move toward consolidating school districts. Disagreement has developed over the details and the timeline. The Senate’s version of H.454 seeks to transition the state to a foundation formula by July 2027, potentially two years faster than the House-passed bill. A foundation formula is the most common type of education funding system across the country. The approach provides districts money based on the number of students in each district and how expensive those students are to teach. Disagreement between the chambers has also developed over who should map out the potential new, larger school districts. The House proposed having Vermont public education experts suggest districts with the help of legislators; the Senate wants lawmakers to draw the lines. Both chambers agreed to have the work done over the summer for consideration in the next legislative session. The Senate nixed class size minimums, a concept in both the House’s legislation and Scott’s proposals, and adopted a different foundation formula. Compared to the House’s version, the Senate’s language also allows more currently operating independent schools to continue receiving public funding in a future, consolidated education landscape. Organizations representing Vermont’s superintendents, principals and school board members, have come out in support of the House’s draft. As a Thursday afternoon deadline to vote out the bill loomed, finance committee members voiced their frustration with aspects of the bill ranging from its pace to the details of foundation formula it proposes. “I’m extremely uncomfortable with all of this,” Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, said, eventually joining Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, in voting “no.”Sen. Thomas Chittenden, D-Chittenden Southeast, voted to advance the bill in committee to continue its progress but said he may oppose it on the floor due in part to his concern that the timeline is too fast. Sen. Randy Brock, R-Franklin, told his colleagues that virtually everyone had something to be mad about in the bill, but inaction was a worse option. “The question is how uncomfortable you are at the prospect of these changes versus doing nothing at all,” he said. The committee’s three Republicans joined Chittenden and Cummings in approving H.454. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite discomfort, Senate committee advances landmark education bill, setting up clash with House.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/malucci-bongartz-1-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Friday announced that Pat Traynor will serve as the interim leader for Health and Human Services beginning June 2. 
Health and Human Services is North Dakota’s largest government agency. It has a two-year budget of  $5.7 billion and nearly 2,500 authorized full-time employees. The HHS commissioner is a member of the governor’s Cabinet.

“Pat Traynor is uniquely qualified to lead Health and Human Services in its mission to make North Dakota the healthiest state in the nation and promote physical, behavioral and economic health and well-being,” Armstrong said in a news release. “His track record of making organizations more efficient and effective will serve North Dakota citizens well as we continue to see high demand for the wide range of services provided by HHS.”
Traynor became president of the Dakota Medical Foundation in 2000. He previously served as executive director and CEO of the North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, now Workforce Safety and Insurance, from 1994 to 2000.
“I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to return to state government and continue serving the citizens of the state I love,” Traynor said in the release. 
Dirk Wilke has been the HHS interim commissioner since January. Wilke will continue in his position as executive director for the public health division.
Wayne Salter, the HHS commissioner under former Gov. Doug Burgum, and State Health Officer Dr. Nizar Wehbi announced in November that they would not be continuing their roles.

(Photo by Michael Clevenger, Courier Journal, via press pool)A judge has rejected efforts by former Gov. Matt Bevin and his ex-wife Glenna Bevin to keep their divorce settlement confidential, ruling in favor of their adopted son Jonah Bevin, 18, who had asked it be public.
The judge noted the high-profile divorce and Jonah’s allegations of abuse and neglect by his parents already have attracted widespread media coverage and that Matt Bevin, though no longer governor, is a public figure.
“He once held the highest office in this state,” Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson’s order said of the one-term Republican. “Whether he knew it at the time he chose to run for office, in doing so he chose to become a public figure for life.”
“Concealing the allocation of assets,” her order said, “could generate speculation about political grift or other unethical conduct.”
The Courier Journal also had argued the settlement should be public, citing his role as a public figure and his advocacy of adoption.
Matt Bevin, a business entrepreneur whose wealth was estimated in the millions when he ran for governor in 2015, and his wife have owned several houses, each valued at more than $1 million. Bevin ran on a campaign of improving foster care and adoption in Kentucky, often holding up his family as an example.
The Bevins have five biological children, all adults, and four adopted children, all but one over 18. Jonah was adopted by the Bevins at age 5 from Ethiopia along with the three other children.
  Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela J. Johnson ruled in Jonah Bevin’s favor on all measures he had sought in the pending family court case. (Photo by Michael Clevenger, Courier Journal, via press pool.)
The judge’s order noted the Bevins claimed to have provided for all their children in the divorce settlement.
Johnson, in a 22-page order released Friday, also granted Jonah’s request to intervene in the divorce case — which he had sought to protect his interests and which the Bevins had opposed.
While it might be unusual for a child to intervene in his parents’ divorce, so is this case, the judge said.
“This court would be remiss if it did not recognize this case is profoundly unique, unlike any other divorce case proceeding heard in this Commonwealth,” the order said. 
As part of the case, Jonah has obtained protective orders against his parents, alleging they abandoned him at age 17 in a brutally abusive facility in Jamaica closed last year by child welfare authorities.
Also, the judge rejected Glenna Bevin’s request to soften the terms of a restraining order against her. 
Jonhson, in her order, said terms of the protective orders were worked out in a settlement and she will not allow Glenna Bevin “to walk away from the agreement she made.”
In all, the order ruled in Jonah’s favor on all measures he had sought in the pending family court case. He has said in court  he is living on his own and spent his 18th birthday in a homeless shelter in Utah after returning to the United States from Jamaica with no assistance from his parents.
The Bevins did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dawn J. Post, a lawyer and child advocate helping represent Jonah, hailed the judge’s order as “one important step forward” in his effort to find justice and stability. She said it also helps Jonah  in his effort to give voice to other children from failed adoptions who find themselves abandoned, often in abusive facilities.
“This decision not only gives Jonah the opportunity to be heard but to stand fully in his truth after years of abandonment,” Post said.
Jonah also is represented by Louisville lawyers John H. Helmers and Melina Hettiarachi.
A key portion of the judge’s order dealt with Jonah’s education and whether he has a valid high school degree, as Matt Bevin has claimed. That determination could affect the Bevins’ further obligations to him, it said.
Jonah’s lawyers have alleged he was in and out of various out-of-state residential facilities  since age 13 and received no meaningful education, calling a diploma he received last year through an online Christian school based in Florida a “sham.”
The judge’s order notes that one of the obligations of parents under state law is to provide a child with adequate care, supervision, food, clothing, shelter and education.

Matt Bevin argued that the Florida-based Veritas Mission Academy is an accredited school in Florida. 
But the judge’s order found no reliable verification of that claim.
“As far as the court is aware, there is no reputable entity vouching for the educational standards at Veritas Mission Academy,” it said.
Jonah told the Lantern in an interview earlier this year he struggles with learning disabilities that affect his ability to read and write.
The judge said Jonah’s appearance in court led her to question his level of education, noting in court proceedings “Jonah appeared to struggle with the vocabulary and communications skills necessary to articulate his thoughts, feelings and experiences.”
“This leads the court to believe his high school education has not adequately prepared him to live his life as an independent adult,” Johnson’s order said.
The judge also addressed another question in the case — whether Jonah turned 18 last November. In a recent court hearing, Jonah’s lawyers said adoption records they recently obtained showed a discrepancy, with one indicating he might be 17.
The judge concluded he is 18, noting the discrepancy occurred in only one of several records the Bevins produced and was likely an error. Still, that doesn’t lessen his potential claims, including support, the order said, adding.
“If the court decides Jonah is entitled to some form of child support, it has the authority to craft an appropriate solution.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bevin207-1024x727.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

Nancy Mace thanked a judge Friday for denying bond to a Greenville transgender woman accused of threatening her life, saying she and her children live in constant fear.
“My kids lives in fear of being killed. … They live in fear of their mom being shot,” Mace told reporters after the bond hearing in Greenville. “I live with that fear every day as well.”

Magistrate James Hudson denied bond to Roxie Wolfe, who is charged and booked as Samuel Theodore Cain, after Mace read a statement to the judge about feeling terrorized by transgender activists. The mother of two teenagers asked him to provide them “peace of mind” and show that South Carolina “will protect women.”
“I believe the trans movement is radicalized. It’s a cult,” Mace told Hudson, reading from her phone.
The congresswoman, who is mulling a run for governor next year, has fostered a reputation as a staunch opponent to the transgender rights movement — what she called “the so-called trans movement” — and has repeatedly used language considered slurs.
She went on to tell the judge she believes transgender people are “mentally ill” and violent.
“As a public official we accept public scrutiny. We do not accept terror,” Mace said.
Hudson then denied bond, telling Wolfe, “I do believe you are a credible threat.”

The accused 19-year-old Greenville resident asked to speak during the brief hearing, but the judge advised against it.
“We’re not here to discuss the situation or for you to defend yourself,” Hudson said.
Wolfe did not have an attorney. Hudson told her to fill out paperwork and let the court know if she needs a public defender.
There will be a second bond hearing before a Circuit Court judge, though when is not yet known. Once a bond is set, another condition will be a ban on contacting Mace in any way, Hudson said.
Wolfe was arrested Thursday for an April 26 post on X threatening to “assassinate” Mace with a gun, according to an arrest warrant from the State Law Enforcement Division.

Four days after the post, the 19-year-old admitted to federal authorities to authoring and posting the threat, the warrant said.
While the arrest warrant says Wolfe is a white male, she has identified on social media as a transgender woman, using she/her pronouns.
The maximum penalty in South Carolina for threatening the life of a public official is a $5,000 fine and five years in prison.
Wolfe is the first person charged in South Carolina with threatening Mace, but the congresswoman has publicly talked about other death threats. Last month, she said she was among the named targets of a Pennsylvania man who posted online as “Mr. Satan” as he threatened to kill President Donald Trump and “anyone who stands in the way.”
She has also cited safety concerns in explaining why she hasn’t held an in-person town hall this year.
Mace, who represents the coastal 1st District, said she didn’t know when she learned about the April 26 post on X where the possible gunman lived and had to make immediate changes to her plans.
As she stood in the hearing Friday, she told reporters afterward, “all I could think about was his family” and her children. As a mom, she said, “it was heartbreaking” to watch.
“This is a serious charge. There should be serious consequences,” Mace told reporters after the hearing. “It’s a serious matter. It’s also illegal. It’s a crime. Nobody, whether they’re elected or not, should live in fear anywhere in the country.”

(Courtesy of Howard K. Marcus)LINCOLN — Omaha will have a new mayor next month. 
Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing Jr. became the first Democrat to lead the largest city in Nebraska in roughly a decade. He is also the first elected Black mayor in the city’s history.  
Ewing won by a double-digit margin, performing better in some traditionally Republican-leaning central and western parts of the city than former State Sen. Tony Vargas did in his failed 2024 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., in the Omaha area. 
Before this week’s mayoral election, Omaha was the nation’s sixth most populated city with a Republican mayor, where Mayor Jean Stothert served three terms and sought a fourth. Ewing’s win comes after Lancaster County Democrats maintained a 6-1 majority on the Lincoln City Council earlier this month. Lincoln Democrats also have Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird.

Omaha and Lincoln are now led by Democrats in red-led Nebraska for the first time since 2009, when Omaha Mayor Jim Suttle and Lincoln Mayor Chris Beutler overlapped. 
The political dynamics of the state are bound to change with Democrats now holding leadership positions in the municipal governments of the state’s two largest cities. At the same time, the Nebraska Legislature continues to drift toward a more conservative brand of Republican — a phenomenon most associated with Southern states but also in neighboring Missouri. 
In those states, blue-led cities face a steeper climb for funding and policy changes as Republican-dominated legislatures work to undermine some of the goals pursued by Democratic mayors and City Councils. State and federal funding often get caught in the political crossfire.
One local example: Lincoln’s mayor, Gaylor Baird, and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen disagreed on where a state prison should be located in 2023. Initially, Baird said she didn’t want a prison in Lincoln, but the state threatened to put it in a residential Lincoln neighborhood until she relented on the state’s original proposed site. 
Partisan reads on situation
Partisans on both sides of the aisle saw different things in the results. The Douglas County Republican Party chair and the governor blamed low GOP turnout. The state GOP chair took a more somber view, saying she sees a changing political landscape.  
National and state Democrats were quick to use Ewing’s victory as evidence of growing voter “energy” against President Donald Trump and political fuel for the 2026 congressional midterms, as Democrats try to flip the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District House seat held by U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. 
The race also fell into some patterns from national politics in the final weeks before Election Day, as Stothert’s backers pushed an anti-transgender ad blitz, a political decision that helped Republicans in November. It was seen as a last-ditch effort to mobilize her base. It failed. 
Progressive news outlets and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha called Ewing’s victory a referendum “against trans hate and discrimination.” 
“Regular Americans don’t react to or receive the call to trans panic,” Hunt said on social media, “Enough. We are speaking to the future.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin called Ewing’s victory a “notice” for Bacon and other “vulnerable House Republicans.” Bacon’s 2nd District, which includes Douglas, western Sarpy and Saunders Counties, is typically a target of both national parties, one of the rare remaining districts that is politically split, though it still has a slight GOP lean. Democrats have won the seat before, the last time when former State Sen. Brad Ashford won in 2014. But Bacon beat him and has survived challengers since. 
He has not yet said whether he will run again in 2026, but many believe Bacon is set to retire this summer or fall, which would set off a mad scramble in both parties for an open-seat race. Democrats are lining up. Already, Omaha nonprofit executive Denise Powell has announced a bid. State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha is flirting with one. Republicans are waiting in the wings for Bacon to decide, including former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and some Republicans with ties to City Hall.
“Voters are sick of cowardly Republicans willing to bend the knee to Trump at their expense,” Martin said. “They want true leaders who will govern on behalf of working families and not billionaire donors, which is why Democrats like John Ewing Jr. are winning elections up and down the ballot.” 
Nebraska’s 2nd District still red
Ewing’s victory joins a list of Democrats overperforming with Trump in office for a second term. But the 2nd District includes people in more Republican-leaning areas than just the Democratic-leaning city of Omaha, and they don’t vote in Omaha city elections. 
The fundamentals of the district haven’t changed, political observers say, despite national media and Democratic talk of the city election being a possible hint at bluer-leaning federal and state elections. The GOP-led majority in the officially nonpartisan Legislature drew the 2nd District boundaries after the most recent Census, partly to protect Republicans’ ability to hold the seat.  Data shows that the district’s borders give Republicans a slight advantage by replacing some Democratic-voting residents in Sarpy County with the more reliably Republican-voting residents of Saunders County.
Randy Adkins, a University of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor, said Ewing’s “upset” win — though less surprising locally than nationally — was due to numerous issues expected in a local city race, including street repairs, but it lacked a “key” issue. 
In the city of Omaha, there are more registered Democrats than Republican voters, with  114,400 registered Democrats and 95,485 registered Republicans. At last count, the other 83,187 registered voters were mostly nonpartisan, with a smaller group of Libertarians, or in the Legal Marijuana NOW Party. 
Republicans hold a registration advantage in the wider 2nd District, with 160,185 registered Republicans. Democrats are second, with 143,676 registered voters. The remaining 115,969 registered voters in the congressional district are mostly independent, or nonpartisan, and a smaller portion in either the Libertarian Party or the Legal Marijuana NOW Party, according to data from the Secretary of State’s office. 
“There are probably some people who felt it was time for a change, some who were upset about the streetcar,” Adkins said. “There were just multiple pieces along the way that led to Ewing’s victory.”
Ewing’s performance
Adkins also said Ewing had name recognition, having been elected multiple times for Douglas County Treasurer, which is a countywide position, unlike former State Sen. Mike McDonnell, a converted Republican labor leader whose Legislative District 5 only covered part of the city. McDonnell, who focused much of his criticism on Stothert, failed to advance in the mayor’s April primary despite outspending Ewing. The mayor’s race is officially nonpartisan. 
According to a Center for Politics analysis, Ewing also made significant gains in the northeastern part of the city compared to Vargas’s failed bid to unseat Bacon last year. East Omaha is home to the city’s most Democrats, and Northeast Omaha is home to the city’s handful of Black-majority precincts. 
Bacon, in contrast, ran more than eight percentage points better than Trump in Omaha in 2024, losing to Vargas by 10.4% within the city limits instead of 18.8%. Bacon also outperformed Stothert’s latest bid by at least two percentage points. 
Some might be taking the local race results too far, Adkins said, but it is “probably an early bellwether” for a more competitive race in the 2nd District, which often finishes inside of two or three percentage points. Adkins said Bacon was clearly “paying a lot of close attention” to the Omaha mayoral race.
Bacon posted praise on social media for Stothert’s mayoral tenure and congratulated Ewing. 
“She’s helped make Omaha the best place to live in America with the fastest growing economy … I’m confident her legacy will benefit the city of Omaha for decades to come,” Bacon’s post on X reads. “I congratulate John Ewing on his victory. We will work together to serve the great citizens of Omaha.” 
Omaha is changing
Leaders of local Democratic Party chapters in Lancaster and Douglas Counties said the race shows that Omaha is changing. 
Douglas County Democratic Party Chair CJ King said the race indicates that Omaha is changing and a “rejection of the MAGA principles.” In Lancaster County, home to Lincoln, county Democratic Party Chair Hannah Wroblewski said wins signal that Nebraskans are seeking practical leadership.
Nebraska Democratic Party Executive Director Precious McKesson celebrated the win as “monumental.” She said it would bring “needed diversity into the top leadership position of our city.”
Nebraska Republican Party Chair Mary Jane Truemper released a statement on the party’s losses in local races in the state’s two most populous counties, calling them a reminder that Nebraska’s “political landscapes are shifting.” 
“Voters are thinking more independently and expecting more substance from those seeking their support,” Truemper said, “We’re rethinking how we show up in every corner of the state and making it clear that Nebraskans deserve leadership rooted in real-world results, not political theater.” 
Turnout mattered
Douglas County Republican Party Chair Nancy Hicks said too few Republicans turned out to support Stothert. 
“The voters will soon be aware of the challenges that will hit Omaha with a Democratic Mayor,” Hicks said. “Republican Mayors have helped our city become such a great place to live.”
Pillen also blamed low turnout for Stothert’s loss, saying her victory should have been a “slam dunk” during a Republican watch party on Tuesday in northwest Omaha.

Turnout for Omaha’s general election was the lowest for a city general election since 2013, with around 32.1% of registered voters casting a ballot. 
For years, the conventional political wisdom has been that Republicans benefit from low turnout and off-year elections, while Democrats need to drive up turnout to win, often relying on the draw of statewide or presidential elections. Over the past three decades, Democrats have pushed to mobilize young voters, seniors and early voters to ensure high turnout. But a wave of GOP and progressive populism has taken over national politics, and, at least when Trump is on the ballot, Republicans have been benefiting more from high-turnout elections. 
Lincoln has been a “blue city” since 1999. Lancaster County’s Democratic Party chair, Wroblewski, said being a blue city with a Legislature becoming more conservative has its challenges, but it sharpens the local party’s focus. 
“We work to build strong local coalitions, find shared priorities when possible, and make it clear that constituents expect good governance,” Wroblesiki said, “Not partisanship.” 
 What’s next for Omaha?
Ewing has already leaned into the national framing of his victory with a recent MSNBC interview, saying he’s “not afraid of Trump.” 
Nebraska Republicans have gained more control of state legislation, making filibusters less effective than in the past. Democratic leaders in local governments have not yet faced a more hostile relationship, like in Texas, where the state is going after cities that have decriminalized small amounts of marijuana within city limits.   
A Republican in that supermajority, rural state Sen Loren Lippincott of Central City, said Omaha shows that the Nebraska electorate is always looking for new ideas and proves that area of the state is a “color blind” to red and blue tradition, like many political battlegrounds. He said Omaha voters look beyond labels and seek policies that serve their interests and the state. 
“Incumbents [should] watch out,” Lippincott said. 
Bacon has recently said that there are few givens in life. 
“Taxes, deaths, a competitive [Nebraska  2nd congressional district] race,” Bacon wrote on X.

(Photo by Shelby Wyatt / Source NM)Executive orders from the governor’s office show New Mexico has so far authorized over $2 million to be spent on the emergency deployment of National Guard troops to the state’s largest city, even before most people might notice their presence on the streets.
As many as 70 soldiers are expected to deploy to the city imminently, according to an April news release from the governor’s office. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham previously told Source NM troops have already started training for their new roles with the New Mexico departments of Homeland Security, Public Safety, State Police and the Albuquerque Police Department.
Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina on March 31 asked Lujan Grisham to send in “immediate reinforcement” to help his officers deal with fentanyl use and violent crimes allegedly committed by children.
Lujan Grisham on April 7 declared an emergency in the city of Albuquerque and authorized the New Mexico National Guard to spend $750,000 in order to help the Albuquerque Police Department.
The executive order states that National Guard troops would help APD with “non-law enforcement” activities including traffic control, administrative duties, transporting incarcerated people, court security, emergency response and “other critical functions that allow local law enforcement to focus on crime reduction efforts.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico denounced the move, saying that “militarizing civilian law enforcement will lead to civil rights violations and further criminalize homelessness rather than address the root causes of public safety issues.”
The military operation is expected to cost $750,000 per month, the New York Times reported.
Lt. Gov. Howie Morales on April 17 renewed the emergency declaration and authorized another $750,000. Morales was acting governor while Lujan Grisham was traveling to Asia.
Lujan Grisham last Friday renewed the emergency again, and authorized an additional $750,000. Her executive order states that it will remain in effect until the money is spent or no longer needed.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s only public historic Black university is turning to an ally of top Republicans to lead the institution despite an overwhelming outcry from alumni, who questioned the decision to pick someone with no ties to the school or higher education experience.
The board of trustees for Florida A&M University voted, 8-4, on Friday to tap Marva Johnson as the school’s 13th president. In the same meeting, they voted to increase the salary offered to as much as $750,000, to match Johnson’s desired compensation. 
She still must be confirmed by the Board of Governors of the State University System.
The selection of Johnson continues a trend in Florida of hiring candidates due to their political connections. Florida International University hired former Lieutenant Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as president at Gov. Ron DeSantis’s urging. 
 And Florida Atlantic University trustees emphasized a desire to extract more money from the Legislature plus individual and corporate donors when they selected former GOP lawmaker Adam Hasner as the new FAU president.
Jeanette Nuñez named sole finalist in search for FIU president

DeSantis installs allies at state universities in purge of ‘ideological concepts’

Johnson is a vice president for Charter Communications who was appointed to the state Board of Education by then-Gov. Rick Scott. She holds her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, a master’s degree from Emory University, and a law degree from Georgia State University.
While supporters of Johnson viewed her as someone whose ties to Republicans could help the school “navigate” a state government and Legislature controlled by the GOP, others questioned the decision.
“In an age of merit-based hiring decisions, how can one justify settling for a candidate who does not meet all of the position criteria, or turning a blind eye to exceptionally qualified candidates?” said Kristin Harper, the FAMU board chair, who backed a different candidate.
FAMU has been without a permanent president since Larry Robinson stepped down last year amid a probe into an embarrassing incident involving a supposed significant donation from a hemp farmer. An investigation concluded that the donation was “fraudulent.” 
The search yielded four finalists, including Washington and FAMU’s current chief operating officer, Donald Palm.
No perfect candidate
Trustee Nicole Washington, a Miami Beach education consultant, contended that “there was no one perfect candidate,” but she defended Johnson.
“The landscape of higher education is changing, and with that the role of the president,” Washington said, citing a recent American Council of Education survey of university presidents indicating that financial management and fundraising topped their job responsibilities.
Academics, Washington said, ranked No. 5 on the list.
“I respect the viewpoints expressed but, respectfully, and it’s proven by data, the skill sets and strategies that we have used to get here may not be the same strategies that it will take to move us forward. And I’m excited for new leadership who is going to be capable of navigating these complex challenges.”
Washington will wind up negotiating a contract with Johnson after the board voted to take away that responsibility from Harper. 
Harper and trustees Zayla Bryant, Belvin Perry Jr., and Craig Reid supported Palm.
Other candidates vying for the position (but who received no support) included Gerald Hector, VP for administration and finance at the University of Central Florida, and Rondall Allen, provost at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. 
Several of the FAMU trustees commented Friday that the weighty decision of naming the next president kept them up until early hours of the morning, including Trustee Kelvin Lawson, who joked that he was “not watching ESPN but reviewing the videos of the candidates instead.”  He supported Johnson and, like many of the other trustees who voted for her, said he was thinking about what the HBCU (historic black college or university) needs going forward.
“What got us here today won’t get us here tomorrow,” he said.
Negative reaction
But the hire could harm the school in the near term if alumni and others react negatively to the news.
Before the vote, the trustees heard 40 minutes of public debate; none of the speakers supported Johnson’s bid to head FAMU.
“People are tired of the vitriol, negativity, and divisiveness of politics on the national, state, and local level. Don’t do anything that will create even a hint of politically tainted prospects. Because, make no mistake, as tired as we are, a Rattler when backed up against the wall and forced to fight for its own self preservation will strike like hell for its survival,” said FAMU alum and film producer Will Parker, referring to FAMU’s mascot, a rattlesnake. “Do not underestimate the passion of this community.”
The FAMU National Alumni Association endorsed Palm. 
Curtis Johnson, director of the FAMU National Alumni Association, said he was part of the presidential search process representing the alumni. He said the association held town halls and ran surveys to hear from its members. The results showed resounding support for Palm, he said.
“It’s because he’s been there. He’s led. He understands what needs to be done to continue to elevate [the university]. And so I would implore today as you enter into your deliberations and evaluation of these candidates that you strongly consider the voice of the FAMU National Alumni Association, which supports those students on our campus and those students that are on the way to Florida A&M University.”

SPRINGFIELD — A growing number of state lawmakers are moving to repeal a 2015 Illinois law penalizing companies that boycott Israel to protest its policies toward Palestinians.

Amid concerns about Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, lawmakers in Springfield supporting human rights for Palestinians have increasingly signed on to legislation opposing the decade-old anti-boycott law. But so far, these bills have stalled.

Illinois’ 2015 law prohibits state pension funds from investing in companies engaging in the Boycott, Divest, Sanction, or BDS, movement against Israel, making Illinois the first U.S. state to enact such legislation, with dozens of other states following suit. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, was modeled after similar post-9/11 measures restricting Illinois’ pension funds from investment in companies that engage in business with the governments of Iran and Sudan.

When boycotting Israel became grounds for blacklisting, Illinois lawmakers established the Illinois Investment Policy Board, tasked with investigating companies' investment choices. Opponents of the laws have warned they curtail free speech. Israel is the only country for which boycotting is penalized in Illinois by the board.

To repeal this policy, Rep. Abdelnasser Rashid, D-Bridgeview, introduced House Bill 2723, and Sen. Mike Porfirio, D-Bridgeview, introduced Senate Bill 2462 earlier this year. Since then, some 22 co-sponsors were added in the House and Senate, while two of those later had their names removed.

“This is about the right for people to advocate for what they believe — in this particular case, for human rights advocacy — without the state telling you what you have to believe and how you have to act,” said Rashid, the first Palestinian-American to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives. “It is a matter of making sure that Illinois is on the right side of history — not participating in the oppression of the Palestinian people – but it is also about making sure the Illinoisans and companies that do business in Illinois are not being forced and bullied and retaliated against because they chose to stand for human rights.”

Thirty companies are currently on the Illinois Investment Policy Board’s prohibited entity list for boycotting Israel.

In 2021, Unilever, for example, was added to that list after its subsidiary — ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s — announced it would stop selling its products in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as defined by the United Nations. While remaining a supporter of Israel, the company said it did not support “an internationally recognised illegal occupation.”

Chicago-based investment firm Morningstar narrowly avoided state divestment in 2022, when the Illinois Investment Policy Board accused the firm’s subsidiary, Sustainalytics, of having an anti-Israel bias. The company then commissioned an independent report that found evidence of anti-Israel bias in Morningstar’s standalone product, Human Rights Radar. Morningstar agreed to accept a series of recommendations, including discontinuing the Human Rights Radar and no longer taking input from the United Nations Human Rights Council, in order to avoid state divestment.

Wavering support

While President Trump-supporting Republicans and right-wing activists rail against a bipartisan national bill that would toughen penalties for boycotting Israel’s government, Illinois’ Democratic supermajority legislature appears hesitant to put an end to its 2015 anti-boycott law, which passed unanimously in both houses.

Rashid’s and Porfirio’s bills have stalled in committee despite the initial support from about one-fifth of the Democratic caucus, including the leaders of the Latino, Black and Progressive caucuses.

Thousands of bills, the vast majority of those proposed, get stuck in the Rules Committee every year for various reasons. In HB 2723’s case, the holdup can be attributed in part to the political costs of supporting the bill, advocates said.

Sen. Napoleon Harris, D-Harvey, was listed as a cosponsor on March 20, and Sen. Adriane Johnson, D-Buffalo Grove, signed onto the bill on April 2, but both had their names removed on April 8. Neither senator responded to a request for comment on their reasoning.

Porfirio, the Senate bill’s chief sponsor, and its chief cosponsors — Karina Villa, D-West Chicago; Graciela Guzmán, D-Chicago, and Rachel Ventura, D-Joliet — all declined or failed to respond to requests for comment.

“Even though it had quite an impressive list of sponsors and cosponsors, it's a controversial piece of legislation that is likely to engender a lot of debate that most legislators don't want to vote on, because they either have Jewish or Palestinian constituents, or both,” said Dick Simpson, a professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago and former Chicago alderman. “Why should they vote on something that isn't going to pass and then cause some constituents to be mad at them?”

But Deanna Othman, member of the Chicago chapter of American Muslims for Palestine, said HB 2723 is urgent, citing both a humanitarian crisis and a crisis of free speech.

“Unfortunately, it's more relevant now than ever, because we've seen all of the crackdown on student protesters and people who engage in boycott and people who are just voicing their First Amendment rights,” Othman said. “If I cannot stand up for the rights of my fellow Palestinians, whose rights can I stand up for?”

‘It’s impossible to tell if this bill will ever pass’

Activists say they are hopeful a repeal of the anti-BDS law will pass in 2026 if it continues to stall this year. But it remains an uphill battle, even as they point to a steady decrease in American popular support for Israel.

About 53% of Americans express an unfavorable opinion of Israel, according to a Pew Research Center study conducted last month. This is an increase from March 2022, when that figure was 42%.

The survey found the share of Americans with little or no trust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “do the right thing for global affairs” increased significantly from 2023 to 2024. Since Oct.  7, over 52,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. An estimated 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas’s attacks on Oct.  7, 2023, and around 250 Israelis were taken hostage.

The pro-Israel, pro-peace advocacy group J Street does not oppose boycott initiatives “that explicitly support a two-state solution and recognize Israel’s right to exist,” according to a statement of its policies. “It is critical to maintain the distinction between boycott efforts that work against the interests of Israel, and initiatives which are limited to opposing the occupation. We neither oppose nor call for these initiatives,” the group said in a statement.

But J Street does oppose the broader Global BDS Movement, which advocates for three tenets: That Israel should stop policing the border on and occupying legally Palestinian land, that Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel should have full equality with Jewish citizens and that Palestinians be allowed to return to their homes, as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.

Lesley Williams, an activist with Evanston Ceasefire who has been lobbying to repeal Illinois’ anti-BDS law, said the three tenets don’t mean “Israel needs to stop existing.”

“That doesn't mean that non-Palestinians should be forced to leave Israel,” she said. “It just says the Palestinians should have equal rights in that territory and that Israel should be following United Nations resolutions.”

The original sponsor of the 2015 anti-BDS law in the House, then Rep. (now Sen.) Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, declined several requests for comment. However, when a 2022 Crain’s Chicago Business op-ed criticized Feigenholtz’s legislation, arguing it was “raising the specter of McCarthy-like scrutiny.” Feigenholtz issued a statement defending her law.

“Israel is the singular democracy in the Middle East that has historically been a consistent ally to the United States,” Feigenholtz said at the time. “Boycotts of Israel, like Ben & Jerry’s/Unilever, are intended to harm and weaken Israel.” She added, “No one’s free speech is curtailed.”

Ben and Jerry’s co-founders Bennett Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who no longer run the company, denied the boycott was anti-Israel or antisemitic in a 2021 op-ed. They said it was merely a rejection of Israeli policy, and that Ben and Jerry’s was in fact advancing justice and human rights, both “core tenets of Judaism.”

Given the controversy surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian divide, many political obstacles to these current bills passing will probably remain next year. Politicians are less likely to discuss controversial issues like the BDS movement when there’s a supermajority of one party — in Illinois’ case, Democrats — for fear of factionalizing, said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University.

Even if a repeal of the anti-BDS law makes it through the legislature, Gov. JB Pritzker may still be an obstacle, Burge added.

“Pritzker is going to try to run for president in 2028, and he doesn't want anything to happen in the GA that could be used as an albatross on his neck when he runs for the primary in a couple years,” Burge said. Should anti-BDS legislation reach Pritzker’s desk, “The Governor will carefully review this piece of legislation,” the governor’s press secretary, Alex Gough, said in an email.

“It’s impossible to tell if this bill will ever pass, and the reason for that is it's impossible to predict where the Israeli and Palestinian war will be next year,” Simpson said. “I don't know, if Israel does carry through on its threats to move all the Palestinians out of Gaza and to permanently take control, that might provide enough anger to cause it to pass. But it is just predicting.”

(Alaska Energy Authority image)With urban Alaska facing a shortfall in the natural gas long used to generate the vast majority of its power, renewable energy advocates have been pressuring the region’s utilities to advance large-scale wind and solar development to meet future power demands.
But no such projects have been built in the past few years, even with generous tax credits available from the federal government. And now, the utilities are pitching the idea of cutting their dependence on gas by resurrecting a dormant but divisive megaproject: a huge hydroelectric dam along the Susitna River estimated, a decade ago, to cost $5.6 billion.
The pitch, sent to three key budget-writing members of the state House, came earlier in May in a formal letter from the heads of Anchorage-based Chugach Electric Association, Kenai Peninsula-based Homer Electric Association, Fairbanks-based Golden Valley Electric Association, Matanuska Electric Association and Seward’s municipally run electric utility.
[Read the letter]
“In an era when Alaska is facing production declines and difficulty securing natural gas, pursuing energy projects with proven technology, like hydro, provides the utilities with additional generation options while preserving existing natural gas resources,” the executives wrote. They added: “We need multiple options to solve the biggest issue impacting Alaska utilities today: fuel availability.”
The Susitna hydroelectric project has been contemplated, off and on, for decades, before development was suspended by former Gov. Bill Walker in 2016 amid a state budget crisis. 
The project could generate 50% of urban Alaska’s electricity demand, according to the state agency that’s led the study process, the Alaska Energy Authority.
The letter from the utility executives asks the three co-chairs of the House Finance Committee to revive the state’s partially completed efforts to secure a federal license for the project. 
Officials estimate that finishing the licensing process could cost as much as $100 million, on top of some $200 million that’s already been spent.
Lawmakers are nearing the end of their annual budget writing process, and amid declining state revenue, they haven’t added any cash for the hydro project yet.
They’re also still considering legislation to require the utilities to generate higher amounts of power from renewable sources by target dates.
Reached between meetings Wednesday, Anchorage Rep. Calvin Schrage, one of the letter’s recipients, declined to comment.
The utilities’ request to revive the Susitna project is exasperating advocates for other forms of renewable energy, who say that hydroelectric development is economically and politically unrealistic given its huge cost and potential impacts to the river’s yearly runs of hundreds of thousands of salmon.
“It feels like an unfortunate distraction from the urgent work that we need to be doing to secure affordable energy,” said Alex Petkanas, climate and clean energy program manager at the Alaska Center, a conservation group. “We have the studies and the information we need about wind power in Alaska, wind availability in Alaska, and wind reliability. So, to see them spending time on a controversial project rather than pursuing solutions like wind energy that are within our reach feels like a mistake.”
Hydroelectric projects like the Susitna development appeal to utility executives because they provide what’s known as “dispatchable” power — electricity that’s available whenever it’s needed. 
The utilities have expressed more skepticism about wind and solar developments because of their variability, though a recent study commissioned by the utilities found that urban Alaska’s grid could boost its use of wind power seven-fold without jeopardizing reliability.
The next step for the hydroelectric project wouldn’t require the full amount of cash to secure the federal license, said Curtis Thayer, the energy authority’s executive director. Instead, he said, lawmakers would have to budget “a few million dollars” to better understand how much work is needed before the license could be issued. 
“We need to spend a little bit of money to refresh all those numbers to really decide if this is a viable project to move forward,” Thayer said. He asserted that the billions of dollars that would be required for construction is “not an issue,” because private investment firms would finance the project in exchange for guaranteed returns.
For developments that have received federal licenses, “there are people that are standing in line to invest,” Thayer said.
The Susitna proposal faces intense opposition from conservationists and some residents along the river, who say that the development would harm salmon by dramatically reducing water flow in the summer, when power demand is lower, and artificially boosting it during the winter, when demand is high.

	The Susitna River Coalition, a nonprofit that’s led efforts to block the dam, says its construction would cause the “eradication” of the river’s “unique ecosystems, the destruction of one of Alaska’s most valued salmon spawning and rearing habitats, and the flooding of 40,000 acres teeming with wildlife, while costing the state billions of dollars that are needed elsewhere.”
Critics of hydroelectric development point out that elsewhere in the United States, dams are being removed, not built, because of their harmful effects on salmon and other migratory fish species. They also say that construction costs regularly exceed projections.
Opponents of the Susitna project also questioned the process that led to the letter being drafted and sent by the executives of the cooperatively owned utilities, which are governed by citizen boards of directors. 
Those opponents said that not all the utility executives had consulted with board members before the letter was sent — an assertion that two members confirmed to Northern Journal, though they asked to remain anonymous to describe internal conversations.
“Utility staff should not be contacting the Legislature or taking positions without board knowledge or approval,” said Petkanas.
A spokesperson for the largest urban utility, Chugach Electric Association, could not be reached for comment Wednesday, while the spokesperson for the next-largest, Matanuska Electric Association, did not respond to a request for comment.
But Mark Wiggin, board chair of Chugach Electric Association, said he was informed about the letter in advance.
“There’s an overarching interest by all of us to find some way to maintain our energy grid,” Wiggin said. “However we do that, without having to import all that gas, would be a good thing.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.The Minnesota Court of Appeals will review whether the state may prosecute tribal members for cannabis crimes on most Native reservations in the state, wading into new legal territory after the state legalized recreational cannabis in 2023.
The case involves a White Earth citizen, Todd Thompson, who faces a felony charge for selling marijuana from his tobacco store in Mahnomen on the White Earth reservation.
Mahnomen County sheriff’s deputies and White Earth tribal police raided his store on Aug. 2, 2023, a day after recreational cannabis became legal in Minnesota, and seized about 7.5 lbs of cannabis, 433 grams of marijuana wax and $2,748 in cash along with Thompson’s cell phone and surveillance system.
More than eight months after the raid, Mahnomen County charged Thompson with felony possession, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Thompson asked Mahnomen County District Judge Seamus Duffy to dismiss the charge, arguing that the state doesn’t have the legal jurisdiction to prosecute him.
Under what’s called Public Law 280, Minnesota has the power to prosecute tribal members on certain reservations including White Earth’s for criminal acts, but not civil or regulatory violations of state law. Thompson and his attorney, Claire Glenn, argued that after cannabis was legalized in Minnesota, possessing and selling the drug became a regulatory matter, not a criminal one.
Thompson also argued that prosecuting him for possession of cannabis violated his rights under the United States’ 1855 Treaty with the Ojibwe, which guarantees the Ojibwe usufructuary rights to hunt, fish and gather on ceded lands.
The district court judge ruled that the state did have jurisdiction, allowing the case to proceed. He held that the matter was criminal and that treaties guarantee rights to tribes, not individuals.
Typically, criminal cases can only be appealed after a conviction, which raised the prospect that Thompson could be forced to go to prison before being able to appeal the judge’s ruling.
Thompson’s attorney, Claire Glenn, asked the Court of Appeals to make an exception and review the jurisdiction matter because his case presents new legal questions that will have implications for Native tribes and tribal members across the state. The appeals court judges agreed.
“A decision on the jurisdiction of the state to enforce Minnesota’s cannabis-possession laws and on the extent of the rights reserved under applicable treaties will have an immediate statewide impact on all Tribes in Minnesota subject to Public Law 280 and on their members,” Chief Judge Jennifer Frisch wrote in the opinion on behalf of herself, and Judges Randall Slieter and Rachel Bond.
Glenn praised the decision, noting how rare it is for the Court of Appeals to intervene in the middle of criminal cases.
“We’re very encouraged by that, but obviously we have a ways to go,” she said.
Both sides must now submit written briefs before oral arguments will be scheduled.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P1140782-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III could be the deciding factor in whether the state passes an assault-style weapons ban this year.
Unless he’s not allowed to be part of the discussion.
The Rhode Island Ethics Commission is slated to issue an advisory opinion at its meeting Tuesday on whether Ciccone’s status as a federal firearms dealer prevents him from participating in deliberations and decisions on gun-related bills. Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, requested the advice of the state ethics panel in an April 30 letter, one day after he was selected Senate majority leader by a majority of his Democratic peers.
Gun bills draw a crowd to R.I. State House for seven and a half hours of testimony

It’s the first time the 77-year-old lawmaker has sought an ethics opinion regarding his ability to influence gun-related policies, despite having served in office since 2003, and held a Class 1 federal firearms license since the 1980s, The Providence Journal reported.
Ciccone did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment Friday.
However, in an April interview, he downplayed the significance of his firearms business, based out of his home in Silver Lake. Ciccone said he only sells one gun per year, usually to a friend or family member. In his letter to the ethics panel, obtained by Rhode Island Current, Ciccone further made the case for why his side hustle should not force him to step out of discussions or votes on gun bills, invoking an exemption within the state’s own ethics laws.
The ethics panel’s response could sway the outcome of the biggest issue on Smith Hill this year. Ciccone has already made it clear he doesn’t support the assault-style weapons ban, at least as drafted by Senate sponsor Lou DiPalma. But Senate President Valarie Lawson is one of the bill’s co-sponsors. 
Lawson and Ciccone serve as ex-officio members on all Senate committees, and could cast tie-breaking votes to determine whether the bill advances out of the 10-member Senate Committee on Judiciary — similar to the power exerted by former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and former Majority Leader Ryan Pearson to advance a contested abortion access bill to the floor in 2023.
Invokes ‘class exemption’
The ethics code states that there is no substantial conflict of interest if an elected official or person in decision-making authority does not benefit, or lose out, to a “greater extent” than anyone else in their business, profession, occupation or other type of affected group. 
The Ethics Commission has relied on this clause in previous decisions, granting, for example, approval for a state lawmaker who owns a fire alarm installation business to vote on legislation related to credit requirements for fire suppression systems, and for a lawmaker married to a dentist to vote on a bill regulating dentistry. 
Last year, the ethics panel ruled that Lawson, then the Senate majority whip, could vote on pension-related changes despite her job as president of one of the state’s two largest teachers’ unions. It concluded that Lawson would not benefit any more or less from pension changes than the other 68,000 retirees and active state workers and teachers, including 400 of her union co-workers.
The ethics panel in 2002 gave similar advice to Ciccone when he asked for an opinion on potential conflicts on pension bills, given his career with the Laborers’ International Union of North America and participation in the state retirement system.
Ciccone contended the same logic should be applied to his ability to vote on gun bills, noting that there are 70 licensed federal firearms dealers across the state.
“Although this may appear to be a small group, it comprises the entire industry within the State,” Ciccone wrote in his letter. “Consistent with the ‘class exemption’ set forth in [state law], “no substantial conflict exists where the individual members of an entire group are impacted equally.”
Ciccone also wrote that if a separate bill that only impacted a subset of federal firearms dealers were to be brought forward, he would seek a separate advisory opinion, or recuse himself from the vote.
John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, said the size of an affected group is one of several variables considered in a potential conflict of interest. For example, the panel in many prior opinions stressed the importance of “the function or official action being contemplated by the public official” and “the nature and degree of foreseeable impact upon the class and its individual members as a result of the official action,” in determining if a class exemption was applicable. 
“The Ethics Commission’s work is very fact-specific, and without knowing all the facts involved in both legislation and his business, it’s hard to prejudge,” Marion said in an interview. “Like many things in our ethics law, it doesn’t hang on a single number.”
What took him so long?
Noting Ciccone’s long history in state politics and votes on other gun-related bills such as safe storage requirements — signed into law in 2024 despite Ciccone’s vote against it — Marion said Ciccone should have likely sought an ethics opinion years ago.
Especially because Ciccone has run afoul of state ethics rules before. In 2008, Ciccone was fined $1,500 for failing to report his positions as a state senator and a union consultant on 2005 and 2006 financial statements.
However, Marion acknowledged that Ciccone’s recent ascension to the Senate leadership team would warrant a new ethics opinion, even if he’d already requested advice in the past.
Three Democrats who serve on the Senate Judiciary committee voiced opposition to the assault-style weapons ban legislation during a preliminary hearing Wednesday, while a fourth, Republican Sen. Thomas Paolino, has previously indicated he also does not support the bill.
Gov. Dan McKee and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi are both backing the assault weapons ban, with McKee making his priority clear by also including the policy change in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget.

After being added this week to a miscellaneous education bill, phone-free school legislation could make it to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of this legislative session.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ban on smartphones in schools picks up steam in Vermont Legislature.","Stock photo by cottonbro studio via PexelsVermont is on track to join a growing list of states that have banned smartphones from the classroom.This week, lawmakers in a key committee advanced legislation that would require all of the state’s public school districts and independent schools to develop policies prohibiting students from using smartphones and other personal devices like smartwatches during the school day. The policies would need to take effect by the 2026-2027 school year.A school cell phone ban was previously introduced in a standalone bill that has failed to move forward this legislative session. But on Thursday members of the Senate Committee on Education voted to graft the ban onto H.480, a miscellaneous education bill that includes several smaller adjustments to Vermont’s education laws. Now, with broad support in both chambers, lawmakers hope to send the bill to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of the session. The miscellaneous education bill is expected to soon hit the Senate floor before returning to the House, which needs to approve the new amendment to the bill.  “I feel like I still have to reserve a little caution, because there are still a couple steps, and things can always change,” Rep. Angela Arsenault D-Williston, the lead sponsor of H.54, said in an interview. “But when it passes, I’m going to feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for everyone involved and making it happen, and relief for our kids and our teachers.”  In Vermont, a broad spectrum of advocates have said that a ban on smartphones and similar devices would go a long way toward alleviating soaring rates of depression, anxiety and other mental health issues among students. “Our students are struggling mentally, socially (and) academically,” Benjamin Clark, a teacher at the Frederick H. Tuttle Middle School in South Burlington, told lawmakers this week while speaking in support of the measure. “And while there are many causes, one cause stands out clearly: the omnipresence of personal technology during the school day.” The legislation would also prohibit schools from using social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to communicate with students or from otherwise requiring students to have social media to engage in school activities. According to Arsenault, Vermont would be the first state in the country to adopt such a ban. “It’s really a recognition that social media is not good for kids and that schools and educators should not be signaling that it is,” she said.Mounting concerns about the emotional and cognitive impacts of smartphone and social media use among children have fueled a nationwide movement to limit the use of personal devices in schools.Already 21 states have enacted laws either requiring districts to adopt phone-free policies or outright banning phones in public schools statewide. Nine other states, meanwhile, either recommend policies or incentivize districts to ban devices by providing state funding for pilot programs. Many countries have also put into place nation-wide versions of a classroom smartphone ban, including France, Italy, and Brazil. Vermont could follow suit by the end of the year. Assuming lawmaker’s do pass H.480, the bill will go before Republican Governor Phil Scott, who has signalled his interest in taking smartphones out of the classroom.In a written statement, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, said that although the Governor had not yet reviewed the specific language included in the miscellaneous education bill, he “has generally been supportive of phone-free school policies.” “We often hear phones in the classroom (and in professional settings, for that matter) can be distracting,” Wheeler said, “so by implementing these policies, which some schools have already done, it helps students to focus on learning.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ban on smartphones in schools picks up steam in Vermont Legislature.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pexels-cottonbro-studio-5081920-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-16 15:03:33.190114

Yost said he has enjoyed traveling around the state engaging with Ohioans in his bid to succeed term-limited Governor Mike DeWine, but “it is also apparent that a steep climb to the nomination for governor has become a vertical cliff.”
“I do not wish to divide my political party or my state with a quixotic battle over the small differences between my vision and that of my opponent,” Yost wrote, seeming to refer to fellow candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. “I am simply not that important.”

Yost said the state “has challenges ahead” and Columbus “needs re-engineering, not demolition.” He warned of a “comeback attempt” by former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown that could “unwind all of the good that the last 15 years of Republican leadership has brought.”
“This is a time to protect Ohio, not a time for a family squabble,” Yost wrote.
Brown has not formally announced any bid for elected office, but former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton has already thrown her hat in the ring to vie for the governor’s seat as a Democrat.
Yost, whose term as state attorney general runs until Jan. 2027, plans to “continue to fight for Ohio and Ohioans” for the rest of his tenure, but “I suspect that this is not my final chapter,” he told supporters.

Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie sponsored the measure. He said it was “personal” for him, having observed homeowners’ frustrations dealing with their local governments in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall.
After the Senate initially passed the bill last month, he issued a statement saying that, following a major storm, citizens need a “clear path to recovery, not roadblocks.”
“When local bureaucracy overshadows the needs of citizens, Floridians are left picking up the pieces,” he said. “We’re fighting for families to focus on rebuilding without additional delays or burdens, especially for those who sustained damage or lost their homes. Working with our state and local responders, we can streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination, fortifying and strengthening our communities before the next storm.”
The bill contains more than a dozen provisions affecting everything to do with emergency management preparedness and response, as described during a Zoom conference call Thursday organized by the Florida League of Cities,
Perhaps most controversially for local governments is that it prohibits a county or a city located entirely or partially within 100 miles of a hurricane’s track from proposing or adopting moratoriums on construction, reconstruction, or redevelopment of any property.
It also prohibits adopting a “more restrictive or burdensome amendment” or “burdensome procedure” to their comprehensive plans or land development regulations concerning review, approval, or issuance of a site plan, development permit, or development order until Oct. 1, 2027, applied retroactively to Aug. 1, 2024.
“You may be asking what is ‘burdensome’ and what is ‘more restrictive?’ said Matt Singer with the League, who cited a lack of a clear definition as the reason the League opposed the measure.
‘A lot of legal uncertainty’
The bill allows for a “cause of action,” meaning citizens and/or business owners would be able to challenge any local update on the ground that it is burdensome or more restrictive to them.
“And so it’s really, really important that you check this language and see if any of your local updates that have already been made would be affected, and whether’s there’s any liability created there,” Singer said.
“As a result of that, there’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” he said, adding that the League worked closely with DiCeglie and the House bill (HB 1535) sponsor, Sarasota Republican Fiona McFarland, to have that provision removed, but it was ultimately placed back in the House bill.
That provision is already drawing attention from local lawmakers who say that it could prevent them from making changes to prevent future flooding from storms.
“It affects every county and every city in the state that you can’t control the way that you’re developing and the way that you’re managing your own land,” Volusia County Commission Chairman Jeff Brower told WESH-TV in Orlando this week. “And local governments should be doing that.”
Special procedures
The bill requires local governments to develop post-storm permitting plans to expedite recovery and rebuilding by providing for special building permitting and inspection procedures following a hurricane or tropical storm. Plans must include adequate staffing for building inspection, permitting, and enforcement and provide multiple locations offering building permit services.
The measure says that local governments participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) may not adopt what is known as a “lookback” period. That means any work completed on a house within a specified period (which can be as long as 5+ years) when determining what counts towards FEMA’s 50% rule. The NFIP’s 50% Rule states that repairs made to a home in a designated flood zone cannot exceed 50% of the home’s market value unless the entire structure is brought into full compliance with current flood regulations.




Singer did tell members of the League that “there are positive things in this bill,” specifically a $5,000 penalty for breach of contract for goods and services during a storm.




“This is in response to some local perspectives that we were able to share with the legislators where cities have had contracts in place with debris removal, and contractors unfortunately just no-show, no-call, and go to another place where they can get some more money,” he said.
“The bottom line here is that Senate bill 180 would reshape many aspects to municipal emergency response across the board, and it imposes a lot of new planning and publication duties,” Singer added.
The measure has yet to be sent to Gov. DeSantis desk.

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)Greenpeace wants a North Dakota judge to reduce the nearly $667 million in damages it was ordered to pay the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline in March, arguing that the award is excessive and unreasonable.
A Morton County jury handed down the sum following a more than three-week trial earlier this year. Jurors found the environmental group at fault for damages related to protests against the pipeline in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, and for publishing defamatory statements that harmed Energy Transfer’s business.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed the movement, which drew thousands to rural south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Greenpeace denies Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the company only brought the lawsuit to chill environmental activism. The defendants have yet to appeal.
In the meantime, attorneys for Greenpeace have asked Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion to slash the nearly $667 million award, claiming it exceeds statutory caps on damages and that the verdict is riddled with inconsistencies.
“This is the poster child of where the court needs to step in,” Steven Caplow, an attorney representing Greenpeace, said in a Thursday morning remote hearing.
 

Energy Transfer says Gion should let the jury’s award stand. Trey Cox, an attorney representing the pipeline developer, called the damages “consistent with the evidence produced at trial and the law of the state of North Dakota.”
In North Dakota, a punitive damage award cannot exceed two times the compensatory damage award, or the amount granted to make up for financial losses a party suffered.
Greenpeace and Energy Transfer disagree as to whether the verdict meets this requirement. Caplow argued that the punitive damages must be reduced by roughly $43 million to be consistent with state law, while Cox said the damages don’t exceed the cap and ought to be left in place.
Greenpeace also claims the award includes costs that should actually be attributed to Energy Transfer or other third parties. Greenpeace maintains it only had six employees visit the protest camps, and that its presence was small compared to the many other activist groups that supported the movement.
Caplow argued that Energy Transfer without sufficient evidence is holding Greenpeace responsible for all damages the company incurred in connection to the protests. He said the award unfairly compensates Energy Transfer for expenses it sustained before any Greenpeace employees set foot in North Dakota, for example.
Greenpeace also alleges the jury form — which the jurors had to fill out to issue their verdict — was flawed in a way that inflated the damages attributed to the environmental group.
Before the jurors deliberated, Gion directed them to consider whether each damage Energy Transfer claimed was directly caused by Greenpeace, or whether and to what extent they resulted from the actions of another group. Despite this being part of the instructions, there wasn’t space on the form for the jury to conduct this analysis, Caplow said.
That meant jurors were deprived of an opportunity to voice whether they believe Energy Transfer or other groups shared responsibility for any of the $667 million award, Caplow argued.
Cox said Greenpeace could have proposed changes to the form to address this issue, but didn’t.
Greenpeace also asked Gion to remove hundreds of millions of dollars of defamation-related damages, claiming the award is not supported by the evidence presented at trial. The jury awarded Energy Transfer damages for statements Greenpeace published about the pipeline between November 2016 and June 2018.
The environmental group maintains that none of the statements are defamatory, but also says that even if they were, they cannot be held solely responsible for defamation. Greenpeace says the statements originated with other sources — including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe — and were circulated by hundreds of other outlets well before it published anything about the pipeline.
Additionally, Greenpeace says a significant portion of the $667 million includes compensation for damages Energy Transfer did not formally request relief for, including some Greenpeace says the company referenced during trial but didn’t claim in its written complaint.
Energy Transfer disputes the notion that Gion has discretion to reduce the jury’s award.
Energy Transfer’s lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities — Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund. Greenpeace USA was found at fault for most of the claims brought by Energy Transfer. The jury did not find Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund responsible for on-the-ground harms committed by protesters, though it did find those entities responsible for defamation and interfering with Energy Transfer’s business. Additionally, the jury found Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International liable for conspiracy.
Matt Kelly, an attorney representing Greenpeace Fund, said during Thursday’s hearing that the award against the organization should be tossed out. The jury ordered Greenpeace Fund to pay roughly $130 million despite the fact that it did not find the organization at fault for most of the major claims in the case, Kelly said.
“We were forced to litigate for seven years on claims where there was no basis for any liability against Greenpeace Fund,” Kelly said during the hearing. “The idea that we should be forced to bear those costs, at this point, is ridiculous.”
Greenpeace International in court filings argued similarly that the nearly $132 million in damages it was ordered to pay should be dropped.
Energy Transfer says that the awards are valid because the jury found both of the organizations at fault for interfering with the company’s business.
Gion took the motion under advisement. Greenpeace in separate motions has asked Gion to fully reverse the jury’s verdict. The parties are scheduled to reconvene for another hearing on May 27.
Greenpeace USA has announced its intent to appeal the verdict to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

“I especially worry about how senior Michiganders will fare under the legislation Congressman James voted for this week,” said Dr. Christine Crader, a palliative medicine physician from St. Clair Shores, which is in James’ district. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Crader was among physicians from across the country, including from Colorado, Iowa, and New Jersey, who spoke during a virtual press event Thursday to criticize their representatives for voting for the bill in committee and urge them to cease any further support for the legislation. 
The event was sponsored by the Committee to Protect Health Care, a PAC that supports an expanded health care system.
Crader says the legislation won’t just result in depriving Medicaid recipients of health care coverage, it will also raise health care costs for many people, including seniors.

“Many poor, older and disabled people are enrolled in Medicare but use Medicaid to cover copayments they cannot afford. So if their Medicaid is taken away, as it could be under the legislation Congressman James voted for, these seniors and disabled people might not be able to pay their co-payments or other costs,” Crader said.
Michigan Democratic Party Curtis Hertel was less restrained in his criticism, calling James “a disgrace” to the state and the millions of Michiganders that rely on Medicaid. 
“The worst part is, all of these cuts that rip away health care from people who need it, is all to give the richest 1% yet another tax break,” Hertel said. 
A request was sent by Michigan Advance to James’ office, but has yet to be returned.
However, James, who is a Republican candidate for governor in 2026, has said in the past that Republicans are working to protect Medicaid from insolvency to “ensure those who’ve rightfully paid into their benefits & our most vulnerable can access these essential programs.” 
An analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that the proposed Medicaid changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next decade, resulting in approximately 10.3 million people losing access to either Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Additionally, 7.6 million people would become uninsured during the 10-year budget window.
Michigan League for Public Policy President and CEO Monique Stanton said the cuts being made to Medicaid spending as well as to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are part of an overall tax plan that would increase deficits by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, 
“To put life-saving programs like Medicaid and SNAP on the chopping block in order to create tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy is egregious,” Stanton said.

“Everything that we know is critical to Michigan’s growth — bringing down maternal mortality rates, making sure older folks can afford their prescriptions, making sure kids and families have the nutrition they need — that’s all at stake now. And for what? To make sure more wealthy people get a tax cut,” Stanton said.
Also criticizing the proposed cuts to the Medicaid program is Danielle Atkinson, executive director and founder of Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based policy organization.
“These proposed funding cuts Republicans are trying to push through would devastate working-class families and mamas of color in Michigan. This is a class war being declared on some of our most vulnerable populations by out-of-touch politicians who won’t be impacted by this political malpractice. I call on the Michigan congressional delegation to vote against these cuts, and to step up and protect low-income families and communities of color,” Atkinson told the Advance.
A major piece of the Republican-sponsored legislation is the implementation of work requirements for those on Medicaid, which the CBO estimates would save more than $300 billion over the next ten years. Democrats have countered that the vast majority of recipients work full or part-time, and the savings will be realized through red tape that will cut off benefits to those who otherwise qualify.
Crader says she has seen that first-hand among her patients.
“We had challenges in Michigan when people had to reconfirm and go through all of the paperwork to qualify again for Medicaid and I had at least two patients in my clinic who for a period of time were without insurance and were worried that they were not going to be able to see me as a physician, that they were not going to be able to pay for pain medications that they were taking for Stage 4 cancer,” Crader said.
She also said while the political battle plays out in Washington D.C., many of her patients don’t yet grasp the changes the proposed legislation will bring.
“I don’t feel that my patient population really understands the impact of these Medicaid cuts. I’m not sure they believe it will actually happen because all of them wonder how could humans do this to other humans,” Crader said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-16-140430.png,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In what appeared to be a campaign stump speech in all but name only, state Superintendent Ryan Walters called to eliminate Oklahoma’s income tax and property tax and said the state should stop increasing funding for public schools.
Walters, who leads the statewide public education system, said Oklahoma should slash administrative spending across state government. Finding these efficiencies, he claimed, would make up for the many millions of dollars public schools would lose if the state stops collecting income and property taxes.
“People love to throw around how much money you spend in education,” Walters said in a surprise news conference at the state Capitol on Friday. “I don’t want to be a leader in how much money we spend on education. I’ll make that clear. I do not want to be that leader.”

Walters, a Republican long thought to be a potential gubernatorial candidate, spent much of the news conference criticizing the state budget Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders announced Wednesday. He took questions from reporters for 40 minutes while a small group of his supporters cheered him on.
When asked directly whether he intends to run for governor, Walters said that’s a “question I’ll look at over the summer.” 
If Walters launches a campaign, he would join a 2026 Republican primary race of Attorney General Gentner Drummond, former House Speaker Charles McCall, former state Sen. Mike Mazzei and Leisa Mitchell Haynes, of Choctaw. House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, is the only non-Republican in the race to succeed Stitt, who will be term-limited.
“My focus is the school year and this legislative session,” Walters said. “We still have time this legislative session to get it right.”
The offices of House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, declined to comment on Walters’ remarks. The Governor’s Office did not return a request for comment.
Their $12.6 billion budget deal cuts the state’s top income tax bracket by .25% and eliminates three lower tax brackets — a measure Walters said doesn’t go far enough to support working Oklahomans. Stitt had urged lawmakers to cut the income tax by a half a percentage and to chart a path to eliminating the income tax altogether.
The budget includes a 3.15% increase to the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s budget and gives $25 million more to public schools.
Despite saying on Friday that he wants “less money going to our agency,” Walters had asked at the beginning of the legislative session for a 2.43% funding increase to the education budget.

He had specifically requested $3 million to buy Bibles for public school classrooms, $1 million for a new teacher induction program, $1 million to recruit military veterans and former law enforcement officers to become teachers, and $500,000 to give educators concealed-carry firearms training. None of these proposals made it into the state budget that lawmakers and the governor crafted.
However, state leaders agreed to boost a teacher maternity leave fund by $4 million and to dedicate $5 million to high-dosage tutoring for reading and math, an initiative inspired by a program Walters established.
Every Oklahoma classroom will be stocked with a Bible, Walters said, even without any state funding to buy them. He said his administration has been collecting donated copies and already purchased more than 500 Bibles with agency funds.
His new state standards for social studies education requires schools to teach biblical stories and the teachings of Jesus that inspired historical figures in American history.
“The Bible is going to be in every classroom this fall,” he said. “The legislature can put the money there or not.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Some health care workers and other Iowans opposed to proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP being discussed by U.S. House Republicans criticized Iowa’s federal delegation as they work on the committees tasked with moving those proposals forward.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks is a member of the House Energy and Commerce committee, the body that voted 30-24 Wednesday along party lines to approve the bill making billions in cuts to federal spending that could include work requirements and other restrictions on Medicaid. According to analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the changes in the bill would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next 10 years.
Physicians in the Committee to Protect Health Care urged House members from their districts, including Miller-Meeks, to oppose the House GOP’s budget bill and criticized them for supporting the measure. Dr. Brian Lindsay, an internal medicine physician from Cedar Rapids, said in a statement that Miller-Meeks, who is also a physician, “must be familiar with the tragic stories doctors witness every day when people aren’t able to access or afford health care.”
“As physicians, we challenge politicians like Congresswoman Miller-Meeks to explain how taking away her own constituents’ health care makes their lives better or our community stronger,” Lindsay said in a statement. “When people can’t see a doctor or afford to get the treatment they need, people suffer, some go bankrupt because of huge medical bills and unfortunately, some people die. Every Iowan must stand up and speak out against this reckless Republican plan to take away people’s ability to get medical care so politicians can give huge handouts to billionaires.”
Eric Kusiak, a nurse manager in Iowa’s 1st congressional district, said the cuts could put rural Iowa hospitals at risk of closing in a statement with Fairness for Iowa, a liberal coalition that supports unseating Miller-Meeks and U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, Iowa Republicans in potentially vulnerable seats heading into the 2026 election.
“With these cuts, patients would get sicker, have fewer places to go, and have fewer healthcare workers to care for them,” Kusiak said. “House Republicans and Miller-Meeks voted to take health care from millions of people including seniors, kids, and veterans to pay for more tax giveaways to the wealthy and corporations.”
Miller-Meeks said in a post on social media Wednesday that Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden “made the rules, then broke” Medicaid, and the House GOP plan will “fix” the health coverage program. “Medicaid is for the most vulnerable low-income families, pregnant women, kids, seniors and the disabled — not illegal immigrants or able-bodied men who choose not to work,” Miller-Meeks wrote.
Nunn and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa are on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, that was similarly tasked with finding spending cuts to make to federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Approved 29-25 Wednesday, the bill moved forward by the committee will shift some portions of SNAP funding to states for the first time.
In a video posted on social media Wednesday, Nunn defended his support of the measure, saying voters have “heard a lot of spin about what’s happening with SNAP.” He pointed to the resolution he proposed earlier in May, the “Defending Medicaid and SNAP Resolution,” as a step he has taken to ensure SNAP benefits are not cut for seniors, pregnant women, children and people with disabilities.
“Now, here’s what I’m also going to do: I’m going to make sure these systems are successful now and into the future, fighting getting rid of the fraud, waste and abuse,” Nunn said. “And that means making sure that able-bodied individuals are working at least part-time jobs, and states that have had massive error rates are held accountable so they can correct that for the future.”
He said these changes will provide more money for the program in the future to allow “vulnerable Iowans get the assistance they need” through SNAP in the future.
However, Democrats and others involved in food assistance programs said the cuts will hurt Iowans who rely on SNAP to purchase food for their families. Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, who is running as a Democratic candidate in the 3rd District, said Thursday Nunn was “screwing over farmers and families” with his support for the bill.
“I wanted to rest up a little bit this morning, but I can’t, because I’m so angry,” Konfrst said, referring to the overnight debate leading to the end of the 2025 legislative session at the Iowa Capitol. “Zach Nunn has the opportunity to do the right thing and do what’s best for families, farmers, and veterans back here in Iowa. But instead, he did what he always does, which is fall in line with his party bosses and vote to devastate his own district. “
Feenstra, who also serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he supported the bill because it lowers taxes for Iowa families, farmers, workers and businesses “while supporting investments in domestic manufacturing, business growth, Iowa agriculture, and U.S. energy production.”
“I’m also glad that provisions that I led are included like death tax relief, paid family and medical leave for employees of small businesses, affordable crop insurance policies for young and beginning farmers, investments in foreign animal disease prevention, and expansion of our export markets,” Feenstra said in a statement. “Working with President Trump, we are delivering on our promise to the American people to cut taxes, grow our economy, secure our border, and unleash American energy production.”
Feenstra announced he was launching an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial run Tuesday after filing paperwork for a run the day earlier. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said Feenstra’s decision to support the budget bill making cuts to SNAP is a sign that Iowans should not support him to become the state’s next governor.
“Iowans need a governor that works for them,” Hart said in a statement. “While many Iowans are struggling to afford groceries and Iowa is ranked 49th in the nation in economic growth and 48th in personal income, Randy Feenstra voted today to gut SNAP – which is a program that more than 260,000 Iowans rely on and generates economic activity that impacts our farmers, grocers, truck drivers and more. … Randy Feenstra also voted to approve tax cuts for billionaires and the nation’s top 1 percent. Feenstra put requests from greedy billionaires over the needs of Iowans today and showed his priorities are not the same as the Iowa folks he seeks to govern.”
While Iowa’s federal delegation voted in support of these measures, the House budget committee voted 16-21 Friday to reject the spending package that includes the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Alongside Democrats, four Republicans, US. Reps. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure while calling for steeper budget cuts to be included.
Though the measure has stalled, budget negotiations are continuing as House Republicans aim to approve a measure next week before the end of next week, when U.S. representatives are set to leave Washington, D.C. for a week-long recess.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/capitolshutt-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

“We’re losing gallons of water from pipe leaks,” said Charles Hill, city council member in Starbuck.
With an aging population and limited revenue, Starbuck – a town of fewer than 200 people along the Tucannon River in Columbia County – faces mounting infrastructure challenges, particularly in its water and sewer systems. Jody Opheim, executive director of Partners for Rural Washington, a nonprofit that supports rural communities across the state, said the pilot project, called “Rural Opportunity, Advancement, and Resilience,” will help Starbuck and eight other rural towns secure funding and technical assistance for critical improvements.
Palouse, another eastern Washington town, also has been selected to complete a comprehensive upgrade to its wastewater system.
Opheim estimates at least 24 months of completion for most of the projects.
“We’re looking at different ways of financing these projects, beyond the big federal dollars,” Opheim said.
Opheim said they are working alongside the Washington Department of Commerce, Association of Washington Cities, Washington State University Extension and the Washington U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development office to help meet the rural towns’ needs.
She emphasized that while participation doesn’t come with guaranteed funding, each community will receive expert and technical support at no cost.
“Our project managers will herd this process, manage this process, do follow up, make connections, facilitate and then where there isn’t other technical assistance available to look for funding sources,” Opheim said. “This is very much a group effort. It’s a big lift, but we’ve got lots of good core partners and affiliates that we will bring to that community table.”
Staci Nelson, grant services director for the nonprofit, said the group has worked with Starbuck before and identified the water system as a top concern.
She explained the town has two water tanks, one built in 1965 and the other in 1986, which are where their drinking water comes from.
“They need to have the interior of their water tanks re-coated and so we’re going through that process of helping to try and find some resources for them,” Nelson said. “And in addition to the water tanks, they have pipes that need to be replaced due to their leaking.”
Hill said the rural town has lost more than 12 million gallons of water in the last year because of the leaks in the pipes. He expects that number to increase as pipe leaks continue.
He also noted that one of Starbuck’s wells has stopped functioning.
“We do hear from people that there’s pieces of metal, you know, rustic pipe in their water downstream of where some of these leaks are, because the pipes are completely corroded,” Hill said. “I’ve also seen it in some of my water here.”
“It has been an emergency,” he said.
He said that many wheat farmers rely on the town’s water system to care for their livestock, irrigate crops, and water orchards – further stressing the need for immediate action.
“There are a lot of people, a lot of farmers, that use the water in town for their cows,” Hill said.
Nelson said Palouse, a town of about 1,000 residents, is facing similar major water quality upgrades to its wastewater system – a project estimated to cost $23 million.
The cost is largely due to the town’s proximity to the Palouse River, where any water quality issue could lead to contamination, she said. The project has a 2030 completion deadline.
Tim Sievers, mayor of Palouse, said the town needs to meet regulations regarding their wastewater discharge. Palouse’s clean effluent flows into the Palouse River, but the temperature is too high during certain periods of the year, which causes environmental implications for the river ecosystem, he said.
“Secondarily, we have a regulation coming down with our 2030 permit about the levels of dissolved organic nitrogen that is in our effluent. So we’re taking steps to address those concerns from our environmental regulators,” Sievers added.
Critical rural infrastructure upgrades often are overlooked, Nelson said.
“For us to be able to continue to support those smaller communities, it makes the entire part of Eastern Washington, as well as the state of Washington more successful,” Nelson said.
Sievers said the partnership for Palouse will be an important step forward in continuing to grow the rural town.
Hill said they are optimistic and hopeful working with the nonprofit, after years off feeling the town has been “left out” of community development needs.
“Many of us wear multiple hats. One of our farmers volunteers his tractor to cut and dig up the ground to replace a pipe. I’ve been on the council for a little over two years now and I don’t get paid. I mean it’s all volunteer work,” Hill said. “We need help.”

Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Chip Roy of Texas and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania broke from their GOP colleagues to block the bill from moving toward the floor, demanding changes to several provisions.The breakdown over the 1,116-page bill marks an escalation in the long-running feud between centrist Republicans, who have been cautious about hundreds of billions in spending cuts to safety net programs, and far-right members of the party, who argue the changes are not enough.The committee could return later to take up the bill again, though it was not immediately clear when that might be. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said he wants it on the floor prior to the Memorial Day recess.Speedier work requirementsNorman said he remains a “hard no” until new work requirements for Medicaid recipients phase in more quickly. As the bill is written, the requirements won’t begin until 2029.“To phase this in for four years — We're telling a healthy-bodied, a healthy American that you got four years to get a job. No, your payment stops now,” Norman said.Brecheen criticized the bill for not going far enough to repeal wind and solar energy tax credits, which he contends are “undermining natural gas jobs.”“We have to fix this,” he said.Clyde denounced the measure for not adhering to President Donald Trump’s promise of “right-sizing government,” as Clyde described it. The Georgia Republican also pleaded for lower taxes on firearms and stronger cuts that would put Medicaid on a “sustainable path.”“Unfortunately, the current version falls short of these goals and fails to deliver the transformative change that Americans were promised,” Clyde said.Smucker initially voted ‘yes,’ but then joined his four colleagues to oppose the measure.Trump wrote on his social media platform shortly before the committee voted that “Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!’”“We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE! It is time to fix the MESS that Biden and the Democrats gave us. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”‘A wrecking ball to Medicaid’Democrats, who as expected unified in voting no against the bill, slammed it as “ugly,” “cruel” and a “betrayal.”“This bill takes a wrecking ball to Medicaid, on which 1 in 5 Americans and 3 million Ohioans depend for medical care — children, seniors in nursing homes,” said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, who represents northern Ohio. “Please come with me to visit the nursing homes. … Perhaps too many on the other side of the aisle have not had to endure a life that has major challenges.”Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the proposed cuts to safety net programs would be “devastating.”“Their changes will kick millions of Americans off their health care and nutrition assistance. That means more untreated illnesses, more hungry children, more preventable deaths,” she said.Republican-only billRepublicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship. Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Republicans are using the package to extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending.The 11 House committees tasked with drafting pieces of the legislation have all debated and approved their measures along party lines.The Agriculture Committee, Energy and Commerce Committee and Ways and Means Committee all completed their work earlier this week, amid strong objections from Democrats.Proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could shift considerable cost-sharing onto states for the first time, presenting challenges for red-state lawmakers who need to explain the bill back home.More than $600 billion in federal spending cuts to Medicaid during the next decade could also cause some difficulties for moderate Republicans, some of whose constituents are likely to be among the millions of Americans expected to lose their health insurance.Republicans also have yet to reach an agreement on the state and local tax deduction or SALT, a priority for GOP lawmakers from blue states like California, New Jersey and New York.The Budget Committee’s role in the process was to package together all of the bills and then send the one massive bill to the Rules Committee, the last stop before floor debate for major legislation.That won’t be able to happen until after GOP leaders get nearly all the Republican lawmakers on the panel to support the package.",,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

In a tale of two verdicts, a jury acquitted former House Speaker Glen Casada but convicted his ex-top aide on corruption charges tied to a secretive political vendor.
The 12-person jury found Casada guilty of 17 counts of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering and Cothren, who left his chief of staff post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal in 2019, guilty on all 19 counts of fraud, stemming from his bogus signature of “Matthew Phoenix” on a federal W-9 tax form and state direct deposit document.
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”

Lawmakers such as Reps. Jay Reedy and Esther Helton-Haynes and former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood testified they wouldn’t have allowed Phoenix Solutions to do their mailers if they had known Cothren was running the company. In late 2019 and early 2020, Cothren was considered a liability because he had been forced to resign, just three months before Casada stepped down from his Speaker’s post after a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
Federal prosecutors displayed several text messages and emails showing Cothren told Smith and Casada to keep his name off of documents. Smith testified that they hatched the plan in a meeting at an upscale Nashville bar in 2019. She came up with the name of “Phoenix” because she felt Cothren and Casada should be able to arise from political ashes.
The company generated $52,000 in revenue from constituent mailers for about 10 lawmakers, money that Smith described as “low-hanging fruit.” They tapped into campaign and Republican Caucus money, as well. But most of the trial dealt with the use of tax dollars.
The trial’s outcome brings to a close a five-year ordeal that started with the FBI probing lawmakers after the 2019 tie vote on the state’s education savings account program for low-income students in Metro Nashville, Memphis and, subsequently, Chattanooga.
Casada and Cothren didn’t testify in their own defense, nor did House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who has been cooperating with federal authorities. The defense raised questions in court documents about whether Sexton or someone in his office wore a wire to record conversations with lawmakers.
The FBI raided the homes of Cothren, Casada and Smith as well as Rep. Todd Warner and other offices on Jan. 8, 2021. A year and a half later, they indicted Casada, Smith and Cothren on a litany of kickback charges.

Olmscheid/ Senate Media Services.Progressives are outraged that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy and House leader Melissa Hortman agreed to a budget deal that will strip health insurance from undocumented adults who became newly eligible for the coverage on Jan. 1 
Here’s Minneapolis City Councilmember Jason Chavez: 
I’m extremely disappointed … They made a deal with the GOP to strip away health care from undocumented residents.
Chavez takes particular aim at Murphy, hinting at a potential primary challenge. “We won’t forget that your re-election is next year.”  
The anger is understandable. At the end of the year, at least 15,000 Minnesotans will be kicked off MinnesotaCare — a public insurance program for the working poor created by then-Republican Gov. Arnie Carlson — if the deal passes. Only undocumented children will still be able to access coverage.
These adults will no longer get routine care, which will worsen chronic conditions or allow undiagnosed conditions to fester. They’ll go to emergency rooms for care. Minnesota hospitals, which favor keeping the program’s eligibility intact, will be forced to provide more uncompensated care. 
The Minneapolis-St. Paul Archdiocese Auxiliary Bishop Kevin Kenney offered some moral clarity on the subject recently: “We need to be able to offer health care to anyone who is here, no matter how they got here, who let them in. Are we going to let them die on the streets? Are we going to let them suffer? Or are we going to allow them — all of us — the basic health care that we need?”
But Chavez’s “extremely disappointed” attack is wildly misplaced. 
Walz, Murphy and Hortman share power with Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, for whom cutting the MinnesotaCare benefit is a top priority, perhaps her most important priority. 
Walz, Murphy and Hortman had to consider the repercussions of a stalemate that could lead to a government shutdown July 1. Which would be devastating to everyone who relies on state government for services, which is basically all of us — but especially our most vulnerable. 
I suspect most progressives in the Legislature know this, which is why at least so far, we’re not hearing widespread threats to withhold votes to stop the deal, except on the health budget bill that will include the MinnesotaCare provision. Their opposition on that vote will be mostly symbolic, as Murphy should have no problem wrangling some Republican votes. 
(Caveat: It’s a fluid situation, and progressives may wind up risking a shutdown to fight for MinnesotaCare for undocumented people. That’s a difficult choice; let’s hope they make it with eyes wide open.) 
We should also remember what Walz, Murphy and Hortman have managed to protect: paid family and medical leave; earned sick and safe time; and unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, which were three significant achievements of the 2023 Legislature. They’ve also protected schools and social service programs from draconian cuts, despite the state’s structural deficit.  
Instead of the circular firing squad, Democrats might consider who the real culprit here is: Republicans who have made taking subsidized health care away from working people a primary policy goal. 
Why not turn your fire on them? State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls, is out here bragging in a press release about how he’s “been at the forefront” of taking people’s health care. 
Rep. Elliott Engen, R-White Bear Township, told a a Democratic senator to “cry harder” for caring about people losing their health care. 
If you want to get mad at Democrats, get mad that they lost control of the House last year, which is what allowed taking health care away from working people to rise to the top of the issue agenda. 
Which means getting mad at former President Joe Biden for running for a second term. And getting mad at Kamala Harris for running a lackluster campaign. And getting mad at Minnesota Democrats for running behind Harris in enough districts to lose the House. 
And when it comes to winning the next election, ill-informed attacks on people trying to govern aren’t helpful either.

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on Friday (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers will return to Jefferson City next month for a special session to debate providing tax breaks to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in the state, Gov. Mike Kehoe said in a news conference Friday morning.
The special session could also consider a $500 million spending bill for construction needs around the state, he said, but a final decision has not been made.
In the final days of the regular session, which ended Thursday, Kehoe unveiled a plan to use tax revenue generated by the Chiefs and Royals to finance bonds for their stadiums. The Chiefs would use the money to upgrade Arrowhead Stadium while the Royals would use it for a new stadium in Missouri.
Despite the late reveal, the Missouri House passed the proposal on a 108-40 vote. But the Senate balked at the deal, with many members saying they could not support it because a $513 million capital construction bill died when the Missouri House refused to allow it to come up for a vote.
Kehoe did not see the delay of the stadium proposal as a final defeat.
“We introduced that in the last week of the session to try to find what the feelings were,” he said.
The exact date for the special session has not been determined, Kehoe said.
The Chiefs and the Royals face a deadline at the end of June on whether they will accept an offer from Kansas to pay 70% of the cost of building new stadiums in that state. The proposal floated by Kehoe would pay up to half the cost as well as up to $50 million in tax credits for any direct investments made by the teams.
Remodeling Arrowhead and building a new baseball stadium would cost up to $3 billion, Kehoe said. 
“I would consider that significant economic development,” Kehoe said of the stadiums, comparing them to manufacturing projects that won incentives from lawmakers in the past
Stadium funding, gun rights law among casualties of Missouri Senate breakdown

Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said she agrees that the state should work to keep the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas but blamed Kehoe for the late introduction of his plan for the need to hold a special session.
“We are at this point because Governor Kehoe committed gross legislative malpractice by springing his stadium plan on lawmakers with no warning and just days left in the regular session without bothering to first build support for it,” Aune said.
The hurdles for a successful special session are both political and financial. The stadium plan died in the regular session when the Senate twice used a rare procedural rule to end debate on controversial bills on abortion and sick leave rights.
The move infuriated Democrats, who vowed the Senate will not function normally until they feel they can trust the GOP to work towards compromise.
“I’ve heard a long time, ‘well, nobody has ever made us pay.’” Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat said at a news conference Wednesday. “You’ll find out now.”
Complicating the debate is lingering anger over the projects that were lost when the House sunk the capital improvements bill. The $513 million would have paid for projects at eight hospitals around the state, supported a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
In all, more than 60 projects added by lawmakers, in addition to more than 20 sought by Kehoe, will not be funded.
One of the biggest boosters of the Chiefs and Royals, state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat, said she could not support a stadium funding bill if the capital improvements bill is not part of a special session.
“Those things are more important to me and to my colleagues than the Chiefs,” Washington said.
Kehoe did not rule out including the capital spending in a call for a special session, but did not commit to it, either.
“I’ve heard and listened to quite a few senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle on that very same issue, and I understand what their concerns are,” Kehoe said. “And I think it’s fair to say everything is on the table of what that special session might look like.”
Kehoe has a June 30 deadline for acting on the $53 billion in spending that was approved for the coming fiscal year. The budget spends $15.8 billion in general revenue, about $2.2 billion more than estimated revenue for the year, by dipping into the accumulated surplus that stood at $3.6 billion when the current fiscal year began.
Revenues are not keeping up with projections and Missouri House leaders cited a need to maintain a fund balance in excess of $1 billion for future years. Kehoe, who will be responsible for making sure spending does not exceed available funds, said he agrees with that approach.
“I don’t think it’s ever appropriate for some politician to think just because we have it, we have to spend it,” Kehoe said. “ It’s more appropriate for us to leave some reserves in the tank for the times when the budget does get tougher.”
Kehoe, who took office in January, had a successful session. Major items he asked for in his State of the State Address — a state takeover of the St. Louis Police Department, school safety legislation and a major tax cut eliminating income taxes on capital gains — all passed.
Kehoe took some defeats as well, with lawmakers spending more than he wanted on public schools, the failure of a bill reducing the top income tax rate and the defeat of legislation allowing parents to enroll their children in school districts other than the one they live in.
He said he looks favorably on the bill repealing the Proposition A sick leave law but stopped short of promising to sign it. 
Kehoe also did not say whether he would put the constitutional amendment imposing a new ban on abortions on a special election ballot or let it wait for a November 2026 vote.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For a second year in a row, New York City and Los Angeles were among the cities with the most population growth last year as the nation’s largest cities continued to recover from devastating pandemic losses.
The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.


Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.


The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-16 16:42:28+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials poised to exceed budget cap to end Medicaid crisis,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/16/ct-budget-spending-cap-fiscal-guardrails/,Officials plan to legally exceed CT's spending cap to avert a Medicaid crisis and pave the way for a new two-year budget.,"State officials are poised to legally exceed Connecticut’s spending cap for the first time in nearly two decades to avert a crisis in paying Medicaid bills — and to pave the way for a new two-year budget.
Both Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed a tentative understanding to resolve the Medicaid shortfall expected to approach or exceed $300 million this fiscal year.
And while neither discussed exceeding the cap, which keeps overall budget appropriations in line with household income and inflation, officials have largely exhausted other options to circumvent that limit without formally going beyond it.
“The administration continues to make positive progress with legislative leaders on an agreement regarding the deficiency bill for fiscal year 2025 and a framework for the budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027,” Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Friday. “We are optimistic that an agreement can be reached soon.”
“I expect we will vote on Monday” to cover the Medicaid shortfall, Ritter said late Thursday, then quickly added a huge qualifier that hinted toward a compromise.
Exceeding the cap now allows CT to spend more in next two years
The speaker said legislators will cover that Medicaid gap in the traditional manner, which involves formally appropriating the necessary funds. 
With the administration forecasting an almost $2.4 billion surplus this fiscal year, and another $4.1 billion stashed in the rainy day fund, Connecticut can easily cover a $300 million Medicaid shortfall.
A lack of budget resources was never the problem. 
But covering the Medicaid gap and other cost overruns in the current budget would push spending $25.4 million over the cap, based on the last month’s projections.
That can be accomplished, provided the governor declares a budget emergency in writing and that the House and Senate each agree with a 60% vote of approval. The $300 million would be drawn from this year’s projected surplus. 
And if Lamont and lawmakers agree to spend about $300 million more than normally permitted this fiscal year, they get to spend roughly $650 million extra over the next two years combined, based on spending cap growth rules. Democrats are expected to spend that money on municipal aid, human services, education and state employee wages. 
Officials have done so seven times since the spending cap was created in 1991 but not since 2007, when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But after a severe recession pushed state finances deep into the red and triggered a historic $1.8 billion-plus tax hike in 2011, legally exceeding the cap became politically taboo.
Lamont, who called the spending cap “sacrosanct” in a January meeting with business leaders, has been loath to tamper with this or other budget controls that he often calls “fiscal guardrails.”
Over the last seven years, Connecticut has used budget surpluses to add $3.9 billion to its rainy day fund and shrink pension debt by $8.6 billion.
But many of the governor’s fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority say these controls, which were last calibrated in 2017, are saving excessively at the expense of local schools, health care and other core services.
These budget caps have captured an average of $1.8 billion from the General Fund each year since 2017, equal to about 8%, and will collect a projected $2.4 billion or 10% this year.
With three-quarters of the General Fund tied to wages, Medicaid, debt service, retirement benefits and other fixed costs, removing 10% from the remaining quarter budget has a big impact.
Critics also say political fears of exceeding the cap have triggered an overreliance on less-than-transparent accounting gimmicks that circumvent spending limits without officially breaking them.
How the various budget plans struggled under the current cap
Since the coronavirus first struck in 2020, Connecticut has used billions of dollars in emergency federal aid — which can be spent outside normal cap limits — to defer cap reform and to bolster programs that otherwise would have been cut. But those resources have nearly all been exhausted, and the impact can be seen in budget proposals for the next two fiscal years.
To keep spending under the cap, budget plans proposed by both Lamont and the Democratic-controlled Appropriations Committee would underfund contractually guaranteed health care for retired state workers by an average of $114 million per year. 
Both also dramatically scaled back a major planned increase in payments to health care providers who treat the poor. 
Budget plans proposed by the governor, the Appropriations Committee and House Republicans each would shift $300 million or more outside of the budget and spending cap system to bolster early childhood development over the coming biennium. The proposal initially came from Lamont, and both parties supported it.
Lamont’s plan would also reduce base education grants to nearly half of Connecticut’s 169 cities and towns next fiscal year.
And the governor would need to borrow $60 million per year to maintain the Town Aid Roads Program, which covers basic road maintenance and winter snow removal, because otherwise his budget would exceed the cap.
Tensions around a proposed workaround
Faced with this year’s Medicaid cost overruns and more cap constraints, House Democrats earlier this week hoped to find one more legal loophole.
They originally planned to shift about $300 million in projected surplus outside of the formal budget — an accounting move possible with a simple majority vote — to meet Connecticut’s obligations to health clinics, social service agencies and other care providers this fiscal year. 
Then, assuming Medicaid demand would not shrink, the Democrats’ plan would restore that extra $300 million to the formal budget in each of the next two fiscal years, effectively claiming a cap exemption on grounds that it was the start of a new program. 
But the Lamont administration balked at what it saw as a transparent and poorly designed gimmick and threatened to delay payments to care providers until after the next fiscal year begins on July 1 on grounds that it didn’t have available funds.
Ritter then countered Thursday by announcing the House would run a bill Monday that would cover the Medicaid shortfall with the off-budget accounting maneuver, effectively forcing Lamont to choose between strict adherence to the spending cap and supporting Connecticut’s care providers.
Both sides quickly thereafter resumed negotiations and struck a compromise, prompted in part by the potential damage to care givers.
Providers responded that — unlike the state of Connecticut — they aren’t flush with cash, can’t wait six to seven weeks for dollars due in late May, and don’t like being used as a political football.
“We will be in serious arrears and not able to make payroll,” Alice Forrester, CEO of Clifford Beers Community Health Partners in New Haven, said shortly before Lamont and legislators struck a tentative deal.
Forrester, whose group employs about 400 people, adding that “things are very tight, and the Medicaid rates are already paying at 62 cents on the dollar. We’re already in the hole.”
Connecticut’s federally qualified health centers, which provider medical, dental and behavioral health care services to about 30% of the Medicaid population, “are already vastly underpaid by Medicaid, which the state’s own study confirmed, and are operating on the slimmest of margins,” said Shawn K. Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut.
The prospect of a six-week delay in payments “because of an internal disagreement between policymakers is outrageous and dangerous,” he said, and it could have triggered layoffs, canceled medical appointments and possibly even site closures.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ritterlamont-1024x790.jpg,,,2025-05-16 13:12:27.428326

Kurtis Gregory shakes hands following his introduction to the Missouri Senate (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Farm Bureau will be allowed to sell health care plans to its members, Medicaid will cover the cost of hearing aids for adults and supplies of birth control will be extended under legislation that passed the legislature in the waning hours of the session on Thursday. 
The legislation, which was sponsored by Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory of Marshall, now heads to the governor’s desk.
The underlying bill allows the Missouri Farm Bureau to sell health care plans that don’t abide by the protections set by the Affordable Care Act. As a result, the Farm Bureau would be able to offer lower-price coverage options, which the organization and its supporters say is necessary to help uninsured farmers.
“This is a product that is going to get people coverage that otherwise cannot afford it,” Gregory said at a House hearing last month. “This is a coverage product that is going to save lives. It is a product that’s going to save people money.”
State Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Republican from Sedalia who carried the bill in the House, said Thursday that the Farm Bureau’s health plans “will not be the solution for everyone. But those without health care plans believe this will be beneficial.”
This was the third year the bill has been proposed, and it’s received significant pushback from Democrats and patient advocates, who argue it would leave some Missourians without protections. It’s also faced opposition from insurance companies who argue it gives the Farm Bureau an unfair advantage over competitors.
If the bill is signed into law, Missouri will join 10 states that have adopted similar carveouts for the Farm Bureau in previous years. Alabama and Florida also passed similar measures this year.
Democrats added some protections to the Farm Bureau portion of the bill during negotiations, including mandating the organization to provide a clear disclaimer that the products it’s selling are not officially regulated as health insurance, mandating the company can’t cancel coverage for members because of a medical event and ensuring the state insurance department will handle complaints. 
The bill contains a wide swath of other health measures, including several added by Democrats during negotiations, especially by state Sen. Patty Lewis of Kansas City.
Those include: provisions mandating that Missouri Medicaid cover hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults, expanding access to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, requiring insurance companies that provide birth control medication to provide extended supplies and tweaking the law around telehealth to allow audio-only visits. 
There was little opposition voiced on Thursday. 
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield, said the negotiations “were able to make a bill significantly better with wins for the majority party, wins for the minority party and ultimately wins for our constituents back home.”
The bill passed by a vote of 147 to 1 on Thursday afternoon in the House. That followed a vote of 24 to 6 in the Senate.
 ‘This is a big deal’

The Farm Bureau would offer lower prices by reverting to the pre-Affordable Care Act practice of what’s called medical underwriting — carefully evaluating applicants’ medical history and risk — to determine whether to cover them and at what price. 
The Farm Bureau is a nonprofit agricultural membership organization which partners with for-profit companies to sell various kinds of insurance to its members. Anyone can join — the fee is $30 per year. Historically the group has been primarily made up of people in farming communities.
Gregory has estimated around 15,000 Farm Bureau members lack health insurance and would be the target audience to enroll in the benefit plan.
Many farmers and other members of the Farm Bureau, proponents say, are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy an individual plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace or make too much money to qualify for subsidies.
Garrett Hawkins, president of Missouri Farm Bureau, said in an interview with The Independent shortly after the bill passed that the organization’s effort has been years in the making. 
Lack of health insurance options for farmers is “an impediment to bringing the kids home to the farm. It’s an impediment to bringing a spouse home to the farm who has pursued off-farm employment solely to get health coverage,” he said. “This is a big deal.”
Emily Kalmer, a lobbyist for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said at a House hearing last month that even with concessions made at the urging of the bill’s critics, patient advocates remain highly concerned.
“To be clear, this legislation still allows the Farm Bureau to sell unregulated products that won’t have to comply with many of the other provisions we fought for over the years,” Kalmer said, including protections for preexisting conditions.
 Hearing aids and birth control

Medicaid coverage for hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults would be expanded under the bill passed Thursday. Currently, Medicaid in Missouri, which is called MO HealthNet, only covers hearing aids for eligible children, pregnant women and blind people.
There was little opposition to that change this year, but in prior years there has been some concern around the cost. The Medicaid hearing aid and cochlear implant provisions are estimated to cost up to $10.3 million in fiscal year 2027, and $2.7 million the following year, according to the fiscal note.
“I realize there are some costs to this,” said state Rep. Cameron Parker, a Republican from Campbell. “But I do believe that the benefit of these services, the hearing instruments, the cochlear implants, outweigh the cost greatly.”
The bill also requires health plans to cover extended supplies of birth control. Plans that provide coverage for hormonal contraceptives would be required to cover a supply lasting up to 90 days, or, for generic medication, up to 180 days — meaning patients would be able to pick up months-long supplies of the birth control pill at one time rather than needing to pick up the prescription more frequently.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly and leaders of the Kansas Legislature approved the $45,000 settlement of a lawsuit filed by a former employee of the Kansas Department for Children and Families who was fired after requesting expansion of medical leave to care for a relative.
Former DCF employee Shayne Watson filed suit in U.S. District Court alleging the state agency interfered with his rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act and was terminated in retaliation for insisting on altering his leave from intermittent to continuous.
Watson had been granted intermittent leave by DCF to care for a relative with dementia from 2019 to 2022, but was fired within two weeks of requesting his FMLA status be changed to continuous.
Court documents show DCF attorney Marc Altenbernt argued the agency didn’t retaliate against Watson and had immunity from the lawsuit. The record also indicated DCF asserted Watson’s work performance was lackluster and that he deviated from a telework agreement. In addition, documents show DCF claimed Watson was combative during a personnel meeting prior to the firing.
Watson was terminated by the state agency in September 2022. He filed a federal lawsuit seeking in excess of $75,000.
In January, U.S. District Court Judge Holly Teeter granted summary judgment to DCF on Watson’s claim the agency interfered with his family-leave rights, but the judge allowed the retaliation claim to move forward. In February, a trial date was set on the retaliation portion of the complaint.
In April, the case was closed following negotiations on a settlement between attorneys representing DCF and Watson.
The State Finance Council, which includes the governor as well as Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, voted 7-0 to resolve the case with the $45,000 payment to Watson.
Watson was hired by DCF in 2018 and worked as a career navigator assigned the help adults without dependent children obtain employment while receiving government benefits.
Meanwhile, the State Finance Council voted to reject a proposed settlement in the case of Link v. State of Kansas. Neither details of the lawsuit nor the settlement amount recommended by the Kansas attorney general’s office were revealed by council members during the public portion of this week’s meeting.
When council members emerged from executive session, the governor requested a motion to accept the settlement. None of the council members present said anything until Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover said the silence reflected opposition to the deal.
“I think you’re finding nobody wants to make the motion,” Masterson said.
“Well,” Kelly said, “we could make the motion and vote it down if that is what everybody is feeling.”
Masterson made the motion to consider the settlement and voted for approval along with House Minority Leader Chris Croft, R-Overland Park.

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)With other states tied up in a federal legal battle, Maine lawmakers are opting to pump the brakes on an effort to hold fossil fuel companies accountable to see how those other cases play out.
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee voted Wednesday to carry over one of the two bills that would establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other disasters.
Before the committee voted unanimously to ask the presiding officers to carry the bill into the second regular session that begins in January, Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) quoted a constituent of hers, Bob Monks, who recently died. 
Monks was known for his activism around good corporate governance and multiple U.S. Senate runs. Brenner said his idea that “if you ran an elephant company, you would always clean up after your elephants,” captured the spirit of her bill. 
“We need support to clean up after the elephants,” she added. 
However, Brenner agreed that it makes sense to wait until next year so the state has time to track what happens with the pending federal lawsuits before moving forward. Maine Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim made a similar suggestion during the public hearing for LD 1870.
Vermont and New York have already passed similar superfund legislation. However, those states, as well as Hawaii and Michigan, have subsequently been sued for those policies, including by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department said the lawsuits are also meant to advance an executive order from President Donald Trump that targets state and local policies involving climate change, environmental justice and carbon emissions reductions.
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Phillips) said his biggest concern with LD 1870 is the ongoing legal backdrop, so he appreciated the time to gather more information before deciding what to do in Maine. 
Since the committee agreed they only need one legislative vehicle to take up this topic again next year, members rejected the other related bill, LD 1808 from Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland). Instead, they sent a letter to the Department of Environmental Protection asking it to report back to the committee with an update on those lawsuits. 
Lookner suggested having the department look into whether Maine would go after the same companies as the other states and collect other data, such as how much it would cost to implement this sort of measure. 
Loyzim told the committee her department was already planning to track the lawsuits as they unfold.

Yellowstone National Park wildlife staff trapped and euthanized a grizzly bear this week after a series of conflicts with human food sources and trash in the park’s most popular tourist areas.
According to a Wednesday press release from the park, the 11-year-old, male grizzly bear, estimated to weigh 400 pounds, had repeatedly sought out food sources near Old Faithful, the Nez Perce Picnic Area and the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot.
The griz developed a strategy to flip over 800-pound dumpsters, uprooted small bear-resistant trash cans from their concrete bases and “became increasingly food-conditioned,” which wildlife managers decided posed a safety risk in such a busy area fo the park. The decisions to euthanize the animal was made to ensure public safety and reduce the chances of other bears becoming habituated to human food.
“It’s unfortunate that this bear began regularly seeking out garbage and was able to defeat the park’s bear-resistant infrastructure,” Yellowstone Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther said in a press release. “We go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food. But occasionally, a bear outsmarts us or overcomes our defenses. When that happens, we sometimes have to remove the bear from the population to protect visitors and property.”

The last grizzly bear killed in a management action in Yellowstone was in the fall of 2017, when park officials removed a griz that was damaging tents and accessing human food in backcountry campsites near Heart lake.
Yellowstone National Park’s bear management plan provides bear-resistant food storage lockers in all campgrounds, food storage devices in all backcountry campsites, and bear-resistant garbage cans and lockers. Park officials remind all visitors that utilizing these bear safety measures remain crucial in ensuring public safety, and preventing wildlife from developing dangerous habits.
All of Yellowstone is bear country, from the trails in the park’s backcountry to the boardwalks and parking lots around Old Faithful. Visitor safety cannot be guaranteed, but visitors can play an active role in protecting themselves and the bears people come here to enjoy.
Park staff ask that anyone involved in a conflict with a bear, regardless of how minor, contact park officials or report it to a park ranger as soon as possible. If cell service is available, dial 911. The lives of other people, and the bear, may depend on it.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Yellowstone-National-Park-sign-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

“I am fortunate to have served Iowa State University in many roles over the past 46 years, and it’s been a fascinating journey,” Wintersteen said. “I am truly proud of Iowa State’s extraordinary faculty and staff for their remarkable performance these past years. Perhaps most of all, I will miss the amazing energy, talent and potential of our Iowa State students.”
“Under President Wintersteen’s leadership, Iowa State’s reputation has soared, particularly in research growth, student outcomes and an emphasis on innovation,” Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates said. “With her steady guidance, Iowa State has met and overcome many external challenges, including a derecho, an international pandemic and more.”
During Wintersteen’s tenure, ISU established new and newly renovated facilities across the campus, and the university expanded its ISU Research Park.
Wintersteen is credited with advancing support for research at Iowa State, which now ranks in the top 3% for research out of nearly 500 universities without a human medical school. Over the past eight years, ISU received more than $4.2 billion in external funding, including three consecutive years of record-setting research funding.
According to the university, ISU’s first-year student retention rate has climbed to 87.6%, which is 10.5 points higher than the national average for four-year public institutions, and ISU students are graduating faster than ever before. The average time to degree has decreased from 4.4 years in 2018 to a historic low of 4.12 years in 2024.
Wintersteen is also credited with fundraising success and for helping to secure more than $275 million for new or revitalized facilities, including the Student Innovation Center and the Therkildsen Industrial Engineering Building. The ISU Research Park also experienced significant growth, with a 150-acre expansion and nearly 50 new tenants.
Wintersteen began her career at Iowa State as an extension field specialist in integrated pest management.

Two Florida congressional Democrats have asked federal officials to investigate allegations that the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) and Hope Florida Foundation inappropriately diverted Medicaid funds to two unrelated political committees last year.
The Hope Florida Foundation is the non-profit affiliated with Hope Florida, the charity started by Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis that aims to connect struggling Floridians with local charities and churches.
  Rep. Darren Soto, via his Facebook page
  Congresswoman Kathy Castor via U.S. House
U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor’s and Darren Soto’s letter to Juliet T. Hodgkins, acting inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, marked the first time that federally elected officials have called for a federal investigation into the Hope Florida matter.
“The transfer of Medicaid dollars to a charitable committee and then political committees appears to run afoul of federal laws, including 18 U.S.C. 1347 (to knowingly execute or attempt a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program or obtain money from it) and 18 U.S.C. 371 (for two or more people to agree to defraud the United States), and may implicate other relevant statutes and regulations,” Castor and Soto write.
“As members of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee that provides oversight of Medicaid, we can assure you that Congress is very focused on waste, fraud and abuse of Medicaid dollars. Any unlawful diversion of Medicaid dollars in Florida means that the state is less able to provide services to our neighbors who rely on Medicaid and support the providers who serve them.”
The controversy dominated the second half of the Florida Legislative session this year. It centers around a $10 million “donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation that came from a Medicaid overpayment settlement with the health care giant Centene last September.
A month later, the foundation sent that $10 million to two nonprofit political committees. Those two committees subsequently sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to oppose Amendment 3, the ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana.
The revelations regarding the Hope Florida Foundation were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald. They led to an investigation by the Florida House Health Care Budget Subcommittee that abruptly ended inconclusively three weeks ago. The chairman of that committee, Pensacola Republican Alex Andrade, said that any final charging decisions would be up to the U.S. Department of Justice.
‘Really disheartening’
But there has yet to be a federal response to the controversy.
“Hope Florida had raised only $2 million during its three years of existence but in one fell swoop, received $10 million from a Medicaid settlement which was immediately funneled through other nonprofits to a PAC directed by the Governor’s Chief of Staff,” the lawmakers wrote in a reference to James Uthmeier, subsequently appointed by DeSantis to serve as the state’s attorney general.
The letter adds:
“The Florida House of Representatives initiated an investigation into what State Representative Alex Andrade called a potential ‘conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud’  but ultimately determined that ‘the best avenue is probably a federal investigation because … these were Medicaid dollars.’ The diversion of Medicaid dollars requires immediate investigation.”
During a press conference in Brandon on Wednesday, Casey DeSantis asserted that Hope Florida has become one of the “only meaningful reforms” to the welfare state since President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” programs from the late 1960s.
She said it was “really disheartening and very sad, but not surprising, to see these slanderous false accusations hurled at Hope Florida in an attempt to undermine all of the meaningful progress that we’ve had on so many families across the state of Florida.”

“WanderNebraska,” a project of the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation, is promoting visits to 213 museums, libraries and notable attractions this year via brochures, billboards, bus tours and prizes for visiting.
The program, now in its fourth year, has grown from an idea spawned over plates of pasta to an effort that has generated 7,000 requests from 18 states this year for WanderNebraska booklets. Initially, it promoted 27 sites.

“We think it’s a neat program,” said Leslie Fattig, executive director of the Historical Society Foundation. “We’re teaching people about Nebraska history and getting more people involved.”
At Chimney Rock National Historic Site, more than 20,000 visitors have traversed the “Walk to the Rock” trail since it opened in the autumn of 2023, tourism increases that Fattig attributes, in part, to WanderNebraska’s marketing.
Similar to ‘Nebraska Passport’
The WanderNebraska program is similar to the “Nebraska Passport” program operated by the Nebraska Tourism Department, which beckons tourists to visit 70 eateries, breweries, wineries, bed and breakfast inns and other commercial attractions.
Both programs beckon people to discover new places and qualify for prizes. But Fattig said that WanderNebraska is more focused on nonprofit attractions that highlight history, and those in small towns with smaller staffs and budgets.
Tourism advocates have long argued that Nebraska — which ranks as one of the least-visited states — spends too little to promote its sites of interest, so the WanderNebraska program is filling a void.
About 35% of all tourism spending is for historical attractions, she said, so it makes sense to give historical sites a boost.
“A lot of these small museums are really challenged,” Fattig said, adding that many lack the funds or staff to market programs or write tourism grants.
So WanderNebraska promotes sites like the log cabin courthouse in Callaway, the Old Poor Farm Historical Site and Animal Sanctuary in Nickerson and the Furnas Prairie Shelter in Brownville. The program also features several county museums and small-town libraries.
“WanderNebraska invites people to connect with the state’s past in fresh, meaningful ways — whether by visiting a small-town museum, discovering a hidden landmark, or exploring a piece of forgotten heritage,” Fattig said.
Prizes and help for smaller places
By visiting 10 sites, a WanderNebraska participant can get a free koozie. By visiting 25 sites, you get a free T-shirt.
The program, funded by donations and grants, also includes training sessions for small museum operators on how to use social media to increase attendance.
In addition, historian Sara Crook, a professor emeritus from Peru State College, leads a series of bus tours to historic sites across the state, such as a “Wild West” tour that includes a stop at Fort Robinson.
Fattig said that the Historical Society Foundation, which had for decades raised money for the State Historical Society, was confronted with a dilemma in 2019. That’s when the then-director of the agency, Trevor Jones, formed a new fund-raising foundation to replace the 83-year-old foundation. Long-established Historical Society fund-raisers were told that their services were no longer needed.
So, Fattig said, the foundation pivoted, and launched a statewide grant program to help sustain and develop mostly small museums across the state. The grant program has grown from $15,000 in the first year to $83,000 this year.
Promoting sites via Wander Nebraska remains an outgrowth of that effort, she said, though the state Historical Society has since restored the foundation’s role as its official fundraiser.
None of the promotional efforts would be possible without donations from supporters of history, Fattig said. For more information about the foundation and WanderNebraska, access the websites www.nshsf.org or wandernebraska.com.

A million dollars for a cotton picker, $800,000 for a combine and $400,000 for a tractor in recent years drove Graves, who grows cotton, soybeans and corn in Tippah County, to borrow money from Mississippi Land Bank, part of the nationwide Farm Credit System, a co-op that provides financial support for farmers.
But this year, as dim predictions for 2025 have farmers questioning whether a few bad years could tip into a crisis, borrowing money isn’t enough.
Graves said he doesn’t like to rely on federal subsidies, but without the $31 billion in emergency payments Congress approved to aid farmers in December, “wouldn’t any of us survive.”
“I hate that the government has to get in it, but I’m not going to turn down anything they offer, either,” Graves said.
Congress in December approved $31 billion in direct payments to help farmers nationwide cope with lackluster crop prices, high input costs and extreme weather. But some Mississippi farmers said the payments they received through the $10 billion Emergency Commodity Assistance Program were smaller and later than they expected. And it’s unclear when and how the remaining $21 billion in disaster assistance will be disbursed.
Rates the USDA announced in March were much less than initial estimates floated for the per-acre commodity payments – $200 for cotton, $100 for corn, $81 for rice and $50 for soybeans – all linked to an unsuccessful bill introduced by Mississippi Republican U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly in October. Instead, farmers are receiving $85 per acre for cotton, $43 for corn, $77 for rice and $30 for soybeans.
While Kelly’s initial bill calculated payments at 60% of farmers’ losses, the version included in the budget bill lawmakers passed on Dec. 21 – the day a government shutdown would have begun had Congress not acted – figured those payments at 26% of those amounts.
Though the law directed the USDA to make the payments within 90 days of its enactment – by March 21 – some Mississippi farmers said they didn’t receive their money until late April. And unlike the commodity payments, the $21 billion for natural disasters has no deadline for the USDA to disburse it. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, Mississippi has disbursed $118 million through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program. The USDA has not announced when or how the $21 billion will be distributed.
Will Maples, an assistant professor of agricultural economics at Mississippi State University Extension Service, said that while the state is “nowhere near” the conditions that led to the notorious farm failures of the 1980s, “the concern is, can we get there?”
“If we stay in this environment,” Maples said, “2025 is looking tough, and 2026 is another tough year. That’s when talk about ‘Can it get as bad as the 80s?’ will really pick up.” 
Maples encouraged farmers to look out for “price rallies” as the growing season progresses, and not to be afraid to sell early.

Still, some farmers say conditions are worse than they’ve seen in years, and that the timing of federal commodity payments – well into planting season – hasn’t helped.
Brian Camp, a Union County soybean farmer, said farmers had hoped to use that money to pay outstanding debts in time to purchase inputs like seed for this year’s planting season.
“What they sent us now, it won’t even pay our fuel,” Camp said.

Lauren Swann, who grows cotton and watermelons in Union County, said drought last summer in northeastern Mississippi made margins even tighter.
“The math just ain’t mathin’,” Swann said.
As farmers face uncertainty about potential impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs this growing season, some continue to grapple with the consequences of his first trade war, experts said.
On a podcast with Mississippi Today last week, State Economist Corey Miller said that Trump’s 2018 tariffs eroded markets for U.S. agricultural exports and could do so again. The U.S. lost some $20 billion in agricultural exports in Trump’s first term, Miller told WJTV earlier this year.
Maples said that while Brazil first surpassed the U.S. in 2013 to become the world’s largest exporter of soybeans, Trump’s 2018 tariffs – and China’s retaliation in kind – cemented the South American country’s dominance in the international soybean market. China, the world’s top importer of soybeans, which is Mississippi’s biggest crop by acreage, sources some 70% of its supply from Brazil.
For soybean growers, “a lot of what we’re dealing with now is kind of a holdover from the last 2018 trade war we had with China,” Maples said. 
The U.S. and China announced a tariff truce Monday, with both countries slashing tariffs for the next 90 days as they continue to negotiate.
Farmers described struggling to square Trump’s claims to be on farmers’ side with uncertainty about the potential for tariffs to further cut prices. In a March Truth Social Post, Trump urged farmers to “get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product” for domestic sale and “have fun!”
“We’re being told to go out there and have fun, and be patient,” Swann said. “But planting season doesn’t wait, so we can’t wait on help.”
Graves said he hopes Trump’s tariffs will ultimately lead to higher prices, as long as the measures “get everything straight before everybody goes broke on the farm.” 
“He said he’s going to take care of us,” Graves said. “But we’ll see, I guess.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/16074248/Lauren-Swann-6.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Jefferson Griffin has conceded his loss to Allison Riggs in the North Carolina Supreme Court Race.
This ends one of the most pathetic and embarrassing chapters for any public servant in the history of our state and country. 
Seldom before has one man so thoroughly ruined his reputation in the pursuit of power. We can only hope that his humiliation will deter future wannabee autocrats from going down the same dark path that he chose. 
Because you see, there is nothing more patriotic and small-D democratic than gracefully conceding an election that you lost and willfully participating in the peaceful transfer of power. This is how a strong democracy functions. Indeed, there is no democracy when the loser of a race refuses to concede. I was once a proud member of the Republican party before Donald Trump took complete control of the party. Now sadly the GOP has become the party of election denialism, where candidates are praised for trying to steal an election by any means necessary. It is a damn shame, and they are taking the country down a dark path. 
What Jefferson Griffin has done the last few months is also a disgrace to anyone that has ever worn the military uniform and fought for this country and its ideals. I believe that some of the greatest and most inspirational political speeches in American history have been concession speeches. John McCain in 2008 comes to mind. 
But perhaps the best and most American speech of my lifetime was Vice President Al Gore’s concession speech after the 2000 election. This was one of the closest and most hotly contested elections in American history, and after the Supreme Court made its final decision, Gore gracefully conceded to George W. Bush. He didn’t try and change the rules after the game was played, and he certainly didn’t instigate an insurrection at the Capitol, or act like a manchild because he didn’t get his way. 
Instead, he decided to act like a man with honor and a leader with integrity. He put principles over power and country over party and said the following:

        “I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly, neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.”    
 
These are the words of a true patriot. It is hard to fathom such words ever coming from such empty and hollow men as Jefferson Griffin and Donald Trump.
Let us also not forget that Griffin could have followed the lead of what former Chief Justice Cheri Beasley did after her defeat in the 2020 state Supreme Court election. She lost by an even slimmer margin of 401 votes compared to the 734 votes that Jefferson Griffin lost by. She asked for audits and recounts which was in her right after such a close election. But after the recounts confirmed her loss, she conceded like a person of character would and went about her life serving the public in other ways. She left with her dignity and her head held high and history will remember fondly for that.
 Jefferson Griffin had that same opportunity but instead chose the path of raw power. He decided to forfeit his dignity and self-respect and now history will remember him as a coward and a fool, if it even remembers him at all. In a world full of Jefferson Griffins, teach your kids to be an Allison Riggs or a Cheri Beasley. 
All of this leads me to my main point, which is that now that Griffin has finally conceded his election loss, he should also resign his Army commission as an officer in the Army National Guard. 
As an Army veteran myself, the thing that enraged me so much about all of this is that he has worn and still wears the uniform of an Army Officer. He knows better. The fact that he would willingly try to throw out the votes of thousands of military absentee ballots just because they came from “blue” districts is unforgiveable. Men and women who wear that uniform are supposed to represent America’s best. The uniform represents duty, integrity, and moral courage. And what Jefferson Griffin has done these last six months has brought great shame and dishonor to the uniform. The right to vote is sacred and if men that swear an oath to the Constitution are willing to break it in pursuit of political power, then you should give up that precious uniform so someone that actually loves this country and what it stands for can take your place.
Jefferson – if you have even a shred of dignity and decency left, then you will call your commanding officer tomorrow and formally resign your commission. Your unit, your state, and your country deserve so much better than you.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/first-amendment-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Technically, kratom is not a drug, but some people use it like one. In many cases, they’re using it to help them get off of drugs, like highly addictive opioids.
But there are other kratom stories, and they don’t have happy endings. 
There are two bills being debated in the Louisiana Legislature – one seeks to ban kratom entirely, and the other would regulate how it’s packaged and sold, keeping it available for people who say it’s changed their lives for the better. 
In this episode, Illuminator editor Greg LaRose explores both sides of the kratom issue. You’ll hear from the people it affects, good and bad and explore the science behind substance and the disputes over it.
Plus, we’ll chip away at the misinformation that surrounds the political debate – here in Louisiana and in other states that have chosen to regulate, ban and un-ban the substance.

City officials have sued. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic will take their fight to court June 9 to determine whether the company can reopen its prison facility as an ICE detention center without going through a permitting process. 
Attorneys for Leavenworth filed suit in March in U.S. District Court against the Nashville-based company, which ran the Leavenworth Detention Center before it was closed in 2021. 
CoreCivic announced its intent to reopen its prison facility as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, which would be named the Midwest Regional Reception Center. 
In its initial filing, city attorneys said CoreCivic must apply for and receive a supplemental use permit to reopen and operate the prison. 
“Our facility – which has been in Leavenworth since 1992 – is and always has been properly zoned,” said CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin in an email. “Leavenworth’s city code designates our site as an existing special use and lawful conforming use.”
 
Proper permits?
The city recently passed a resolution that indicated CoreCivic needed permission to open its facility, Gustin said. 
“There’s nothing in Leavenworth’s code that allows for such a resolution to rescind zoning,” he said. 
City officials do not agree. In a 211-page filing with attachments, their attorneys said that, while the lawsuit is about the need for proper permitting, there were other problems too. 
From 1992 to 2021, when CoreCivic operated the detention center, the company “became embroiled in multiple widely publicized scandals resulting from its gross mismanagement of the Facility and the ensuing rampant abuse, violence, and violations of the constitutional rights of its detainees and staff,” the filing said. 
“CoreCivic’s mismanagement directly and indirectly impacted the City in countless ways, including for example, by imposing unexpected maintenance costs on its taxpayers, unreasonably increasing the burden on the City’s police and law enforcement agencies to address violent crime, and even impeding the City’s investigation of sexual assaults and other violent crimes against detainees and staff,” the filing said. 
The city’s lawsuit contends that CoreCivic was already operating the prison when the city enacted its development rules that require a permit, so the business was grandfathered in under the new rules. But by ceasing operations for three years, the filing said, CoreCivic must now apply for the special use permit. 
In fact, CoreCivic applied for a special use permit in February 2025 but about three weeks later withdrew that application, the city’s filing said. 
 
Back and forth
Community activists are speaking about against the idea of CoreCivic operating a prison in Leavenworth.

Former CoreCivic employees regularly speak at city and county meetings about their negative experiences working in the closed detention center, and state organizations including the Kansas ACLU have helped organize press conferences and rallies. Objections include how CoreCivic operates, whether people held at the facility will be released into the community, and general opposition to immigrant detention centers.
Gustin said the company, as of April 30, had received applications from more than 1,100 people who want to work at the site. 
“Despite what politically extreme outsider groups are saying, potential new employees and local business partners are excited to be part of what we’re creating in Leavenworth,” said Misty Mackey, warden of the new facility, in a press release. “We’re looking forward to operating a safe, transparent, accountable facility that will be a positive for this community dedicated to public service.”
Gustin said there has been inaccurate reporting about employees working on a job at the prison to replace the facility’s roof. CoreCivic issued cease-and-desist letters to those who accused the roofing company, Bass Roofing and Restoration, Fort Worth, of hiring workers without the proper permits. 
“Any claims that our company has a contractor working for us at our Leavenworth facility that has undocumented or unauthorized workers doing the work are completely false,” he said. “We have been furnished documentation of the legal status of all workers on the roofing project at our facility from the primary contractor and subcontractor.”
The company has said that it will use local contractors at the facility, and Gustin said CoreCivic did reach out to local vendors.
“Experience in roofing our facilities and experience working on our federally contracted facilities is a factor we evaluate in reviewing bids,” he said. “It’s important to note that the roofing contractor who was selected for this project has handled similar work at another of our federal facilities, which required special clearances for workers.”
Collaborative goals
Although aware of community disagreement about the facility, Gustin said CoreCivic wants to work with Leavenworth city and county officials. 
“In addition to the impact fees we’ve agreed to pay – and the property tax we already pay – we’ve worked to both listen to and be transparent with the community,” he said.
CoreCivic has offered the following impact fees:

One-time impact fee of $1,000,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Annual impact fee of $250,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Additional $150,000 annually to the police department

Gustin said no one detained at the facility will be released directly into the Leavenworth community, which is one opposition point. 
“Our facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability from our government partners, including regular audits and onsite monitors,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P1010074-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are backing a renewed Senate push calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to take urgent diplomatic action to deliver food and emergency aid to civilians trapped in the war-torn enclave.
The two lawmakers joined 27 of their Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution urging the administration to mobilize all available diplomatic tools to break the Israeli blockade that has prevented lifesaving assistance from reaching Palestinian civilians. 
The measure comes amid reports of a worsening humanitarian disaster, with tens of thousands of children at risk of starvation and thousands already suffering from acute malnutrition.
“Every day that innocent civilians, including children, are going without access to food, clean water, or necessary medical care, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens,” Warner said in a statement. 
Warner said it is the responsibility of Israeli authorities to ensure that emergency food and humanitarian aid can reach Palestinian civilians. He added that as lawmakers continue to press for a full ceasefire and the return of all remaining hostages, “the Trump administration must work to ensure that innocent people are not left to die because of inaction.”
Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, echoed Warner’s urgency and emphasized the need for international aid organizations to be allowed to operate freely in the region.
He stressed that “the Israeli government must immediately lift any blockades on food and emergency aid and allow credible international organizations to facilitate the swift delivery of lifesaving aid to civilians in Gaza.” 
Kaine also emphasized the need to keep pushing for a ceasefire agreement that would bring hostages home and open the door to increased humanitarian assistance, calling it “the only durable path to a resolution of this crisis.”
Since March 2, the Israeli government has blocked all food and emergency aid —  medicine, infant formula, fuel and other essential supplies — from reaching civilians in Gaza. That same month, the United Nations reported the closure of all 25 World Food Program-supported bakeries in the region due to lack of fuel and wheat. 
The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. In response, Israel initiated a large-scale military campaign in Gaza, including air strikes and a ground invasion, with the stated objective of dismantling Hamas and securing the release of hostages. 
Since then, the conflict has resulted in more than 52,000 Palestinian deaths, widespread destruction and the displacement of nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents. The ongoing blockade and military operations have severely exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the region.
Emergency food parcels meant to last two weeks have been depleted, and malnutrition is spreading rapidly among children, with an estimated 10,000 already affected since January. “Once you get to that stage, without treatment, you will die,” warned Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the UN health agency.
Harris added that the number of children receiving care in Gaza’s partially functioning hospitals is lower than anticipated — likely because many are unable to reach medical facilities at all.
WHO data also shows that one in five children is unable to complete treatment, a consequence of ongoing displacement and the unstable, chaotic conditions on the ground.
The Senate resolution does not impose new policy but aims to intensify diplomatic pressure on both the Israeli government and the Trump administration to take immediate steps to allow aid to flow, and to secure a broader ceasefire agreement.

(Photo provided by the New Mexico Health Care Authority)David Scrase has worked as a geriatrician in New Mexico for nearly 30 years, and served several stints as the secretary of the Health and Human Services Departments. He is on the frontlines when it comes to treating older residents and their caregivers.
“This is a growing, giant issue,” Scrase told Source NM. “I always tell people…I never go into a room where at least 80% of the people aren’t trying to figure out what to do with an older person in their family who’s going through something like this. It might not be their immediate family, but…everyone is on the verge of, or in the middle of, or just past having to make these kinds of decisions about how to provide care.”
Scrase started his practice in Michigan in 1981, relocated in 1998 to New Mexico and, he says, started concentrating on patients 75 and older in 2015. He also works as a clinical professor with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.
Source NM spoke with Scrase recently about his concerns over aging health care and caregiving. The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: What concerns do you have about the state of care for seniors in New Mexico?
David Scrase: New Mexico in the year 2000, we were ranked number 39th in the country in terms of the percent of people we had in our population that were 65 and older. And in 2030, according to some really reliable projections, we’ll rank fourth. 
NM Aging department commits to helping seniors age ‘in place’ and ‘autonomously’ in new draft plan

Seniors, in general, use about three times as many resources as people under 65, and so you’ve got this more than doubling of the senior population combined with three times the use rate. So there’s going to be a dramatic growth of seniors and need for care for seniors. 
There’s also the fact that we have the number one poverty rate among people 65 and older, so we have the highest poverty rate for seniors.  And poverty creates illness and complexity.
In the United States, over 6 million people are living with Alzheimer’s disease.  That’s projected to more than double in the next 15 to 20 years. And over 11 million people are caregiving for dementia patients and they’re providing 15 billion hours of free care. And in addition to having to really grow our healthcare facilities to manage all the growth in the population and their use of resources, we’re going to have an issue with caregivers.
What are you seeing in your own practice?
Typically, we see people with dementia either coming in with their spouse, who probably is about the same age as them, and they’re in their 80s and they’re getting progressively less able to perform normal activities or daily living. So the natural history of Alzheimer’s disease is a gradual decline and, therefore, how much caregiving they need is a gradual increase. As we have more Alzheimer’s disease patients and they have this decline, more burden is placed on the families.  And so it’s extremely rare for me to see someone in their 80s not get completely worn out if they’re the sole caregiver for a spouse or partner. 
The most common group of people outside the home that become caregivers are, of course, daughters, which is about 50%, and then followed by daughters-in-law, which is estimated to be 40 to 45%, and so then the men get involved, unfortunately in the last 5 to 10%. And these caregivers, they’re quitting their jobs. If they’re from a big family, they set up some sort of elaborate rotation, but it’s really, really hard to provide care at home for people who may be at the nursing home-level of care needed.  
That is an economic consequence to their family, to the country, et cetera, et cetera, because Medicare doesn’t pay a daughter to take care of her dad. They don’t provide any help when Dad moves in with the family. 
As a geriatrician, I’ll have residents rotate with me, and I’ll always say at the beginning of the session, because half of my patients maybe have dementia, I’ll say, ‘I want you to pay attention to, one, how advanced this patient’s dementia is and, two, how much time do I spend talking to the patient versus how much time I spend talking to the caregiver.’ And as people’s dementia advances, I spend a lot more time making sure the caregiver’s OK, that they have strategies to take care of themselves, that they can cope, because Alzheimer’s disease, we don’t have a lot of great treatments that really improve it.  And if the caregiver collapses, then the whole system collapses. And so typically, the worse the dementia, the more time I spend with the caregivers. 
What concerns have you heard from other New Mexico practitioners?
People are living longer and older people are becoming increasingly complex. I’ve seen a huge change from 1990.  And so it’s harder for some primary care doctors to manage the growing complexity of an 80-year-old’s medical problems. If someone raises the question and someone has a memory issue, that’s like a half hour of time that you have to figure out how to squeeze into a 20- or 30-minute appointment. And often it doesn’t come up until halfway through and so doctors are scheduling people to come back for those assessments. But we’re going to see more and more of it. 
What advice do you give to family caregivers?
The number one thing is you need to take care of yourself first. And it’s like you have this bucket of what you can scoop out every day of help to give to your loved one.  And if your bucket’s not full, it’s not a long-term strategy. That’s probably the biggest issue is getting people to accept the fact that to be an effective caregiver, the first thing they need to do is take care of themselves.
We have these things called the Six Activities of Daily Living: bathing, dressing, feeding, moving around, transferring, continence and going to the bathroom, and when people need help with two of those six, they qualify at the basic level for nursing home care, and there’s families who’re trying to provide three, four, five, sometimes six things at home.  And so if it’s clear that the family members are just not able to survive this, then I’ll recommend that they improve the quality of time they spend with their loved one by putting them in a place where trained professionals can provide all this day-to-day medical care and support care and they can go and have quality time with their relative. 
And then there’s a middle one where they’re not as bad as they need to be in a nursing home, but it’s clear that we’re on this downhill course. And I’ll say, ‘you need to have a plan B. I suggest you go out and look at some assisted living places or some graduated level of care places where you could be in assisted living and then go to a memory care unit maybe and then a nursing home.’
Most people focus on the question of whether or not they want to go to a nursing home, yes or no. And I don’t think that—particularly as people get sicker and sicker— is a helpful question to ask. I think the question is, ‘Do I want to go to a nursing home and accept the pros and cons of that choice, or do I want to keep mom at home and accept the pros and cons of that choice?’ Because there are consequences whichever decision, and that’s why I think I try to work with families to say, ‘hey, this isn’t something you need to decide to feel guilty about. You could really focus on the quality of the time you’re spending with your loved one.’

(Photo courtesy of USDA)A study by the University of Southern California estimates hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic metals have been dumped onto forests during aerial fire retardant drops during the past decade potentially causing harm to wildlife, specifically endangered and threatened species, according to new federal lawsuit filed against the U.S. Forest Service.
The bright red fire retardant, often seen on television being dumped from large air tankers, contains cadmium, selenium, chromium, and other metals, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics on May 7. The organization is a non-profit made up of current and former USFS employees dedicated to protecting the country’s forests and reform within the agency.
“This stuff is astonishingly dirty,” said Andy Stahl, the executive director of the organization. “Why the hell are we using such a dirty retardant?”

The chemicals found in some retardants can also be fatal to aquatic life and high concentrations of the metals can be toxic to humans, too. The lawsuit focuses on protections for wildlife, alleging the federal agencies are violating the Endangered Species Act.
“At the risk of doing the regulatory agencies job for them, Plaintiff points out the obvious – toxic metals in aerial retardant are bad for many Threatened and Endangered species,” the lawsuit reads.
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are also defendants in the lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs are seek acknowledgement and disclosure of the toxic metals being used, as well as biological opinions from other agencies assessing the impact of the fire retardant on threatened and endangered animals.
The USC Study, which is referenced in the lawsuit, was published in 2024 after researchers bought fire retardant and put it in a mass spectrophotometer to determine the chemical make-up of the retardant.
“Based on information and belief, the Forest Service has known about the presence of some, or all, of these metals in aerial fire retardant since well before the publication of the USC study,” the lawsuit reads.
The study estimated that between 2009 and 2021, about 840,000 pounds of toxic metals were added into the environment due to fire retardant drops in the United States.
Companies only had to disclose part of their retardant formula, according to the study, necessitating the mass spectrometry test. Previous concerns around retardants mostly centered on it containing ammonium polyphosphates, which can kill wildlife.
“They’re the ones who have really blown open this issue that retardant, the Phos-Chek retardant, contains astonishingly high levels of heavy metals like cadmium,” Stahl said. “We’ve suspected that for years.”
 ‘Most expensive, least effective’

The organization filed the suit in Missoula in part due to its long association with wildland firefighting.
The United States Department of Agriculture has a Technology and Development Center in Missoula, which includes a lab where fire retardants are tested and certified. Missoula has been at the center of aerial firefighting since the 1940s.
“Missoula tends to be a focal point with fire retardant,” said Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service fire research scientist with decades of fire experience.
He also worked at the Missoula Technology and Development Center and doesn’t think fire retardant’s work.
“It’s just about the most expensive, least effective mechanism of fire suppression,” Cohen said.
Drops can be impacted by winds, which can also ground aircraft in the first place. Embers can also move over retardant lines and in a famous example, jumped over a six-lane interstate near Santa Rosa during a 2017 fire.
Direct attack on a fire, or when firefighters’ objective is to contain the blaze as quickly as possible, is also a combination of people, machines and tools. rarely, if ever, is only one method used to work a wildfire.

Cohen said multiple studies into whether retardant drops have any impact on the perimeter of fires have shown inconclusive results as to whether or not they work.
The assumption that retardant drops are effective is a dangerous notion, especially in legal arguments, Cohen said. In a previous lawsuit filed by the ethics group, a Missoula judge ruled that fire retardant does pollute water, but allowed agencies to continue the practice.
“The judge admitted that that was happening and essentially decided against withholding the use of the retardant based on the statement, something on the order of it is conceivable that greater harm to the environment, people and their property would occur without using fire retardant and that assumes that fire retardant is effective” Cohen said. “And to me, that’s very troubling.”
For Stahl, the drops are often about optics and he went on to say the vast majority of aerial retardant drops are ineffective. They are also only used on about 5% of fires, he added.
“Some of the Missoula Fire Science researchers have said to me, quietly, we would accomplish the same damn thing if we just put red food coloring into water and dumped it out of airplanes,” Stahl said. “It would look good on CNN. It wouldn’t be bad for the environment, and it would be just as effective in fire suppression.”
 ‘The cowboy coming over the ridge’

Fighting fires is expected to get more expensive across the country as the climate turns drier and hotter.
Forestry practices in the United States have also focused on suppression, necessitating the armies of firefighters and equipment fire agencies utilize each year. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the five-year average for suppression efforts in the U.S. is about $3 billion annually.
Prescribed fires, or fires set with the purpose of clearing out fuels or other land management goals, are sometimes used as a tool by fire agencies.
Decades of suppression have left many forests overgrown and full of dead wood, generally regarded in the firefighting world as “fuel” that can make fires more intense.
Prescribed burns seek to take some of that intensity out of wildfires by removing fuels ahead of time.
But there’s a problem there too, Cohen said — the scale of prescribed burns is not nearly enough.
“Prescribed burning is pointless the way we’re doing it now,” Cohen said.

Stahl brought up the example of recent wildfires in Minnesota. Prior to European colonization, the area was an oak savannah that did not have dense forest.
“We’ve committed all the great plains to croplands and have suppressed fire, we now have forests and these in Minnesota and similar northern tier states that used to be savanna, oak grasslands, and those forests when the humidity is low and the wind is high, which, by the way, means the airplanes that dump either water or retardant can’t fly. We get these fires, and they got lots to burn, a lot of biomass to burn.”
To address the issue, Cohen said the focus should be on building and planning. He views community wildfire risk as a structure ignition problem – the way we build makes structures too easily burned. He said if more fire resistant buildings are constructed with fire resistance in mind, fire crews can have a better plan to fight fires and fewer structures will be lost.
No community can fully be fireproofed, Cohen said, but that doesn’t mean it hurts to try. The more buildings that are protected, the less limited fire resources are stretched.
“We can reduce the number of ignitions that do occur and can be matched by our fire protection,” Cohen said.
Communities across the country are updating their fire readiness and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy has made a point of introducing legislation on the topic, including some for aerial response to fires.
The problem for some, though, is whether aerial bombardment is the most effective strategy for fighting wildfires. And whether the cost, both financially and on the environment, is worth it.
“We do it because it looks good on CNN. It’s the cowboy coming over the ridge,” Stahl said. “Everybody’s real excited. And they see the retardant bomber arrive and the red stuff come out of the plane. They think, ‘Oh, my God, we’re saved.’ Yeah, not so much.”

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A southern Iowa school teacher who lost her job after giving a female student a condom for the girl’s protection has been denied unemployment benefits.
According to state records, Cheyenne Wilson was hired as a high school science teacher by the Clarke Community School District in August 2024. According to testimony given at a state hearing in March, four girls were in Wilson’s classroom on Nov. 14, 2024, for an after-school study session. The students were seated approximately 4 feet away from Wilson while discussing a text conversation one of the students was having with a boy.
One of the students asked Wilson is she knew the definition of an acronym used to describe a particular sex act, and Wilson responded that she did, after which the student stated her own definition of the term.
The conversation then shifted to another sex act, with one student indicating she was nervous about performing the act and using her teeth. Wilson allegedly responded, “Don’t use your teeth, then.”
When it became clear to Wilson that the student was planning to have sex with a boy, she gave the student a condom from her desk for the girl’s protection. Four days later, a complaint was filed with the school district and the principal, Joe Blazevich, began an investigation, with Wilson placed on administrative leave.
The district later sent a letter to Wilson, saying her behavior had called into question her fitness for duty and her ability to serve as an effective role model for students and employees of the district. The letter went on to state that Wilson was not to speak to students and staff or be on school district premises or attend any district activities during the investigation.
On Nov. 20, 2024, Blazevich and Superintendent Kurt DeVore held a meeting with Wilson, during which she allegedly confirmed what had transpired during the Nov. 14 incident.  DeVore told Wilson she had the option to resign and that if she refused there would be an additional “district level” investigation of her conduct. Wilson opted to resign.
Wilson was initially awarded unemployment benefits after a fact-finding interview, but the school district appealed that decision, leading to a March 28 hearing before Administrative Law Judge Emily Drenkow Carr.
At the hearing, Blazevich testified that Wilson should have redirected the students’ conversation to a more appropriate subject matter and noted that Wilson was not a sex educator and was not tasked with addressing such issues with students.
In finding that Wilson was not entitled to unemployment benefits, Carr stated the evidence indicated Wilson’s resignation was not forced and that she was given the option of remaining employed while undergoing a district-level investigation that might involve the school board.
“While Ms. Wilson’s decision to resign may have been for good personal reasons, it was not with good cause attributable to the employer,” Carr ruled.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

The measure doesn’t represent a significant cost savings for consumers. It would only shave about 38 cents off a $9 box of tampons.
But advocates raising awareness about the financial burden some people face with every menstrual cycle — and the resulting health consequences — argue that doing away with the state “tampon tax” does have symbolic importance.
“It’s not going to cost (the state) that much,” said Emily Swanigan, a spokeswoman for Period, an education and advocacy group, “but it’s going to demonstrate that women’s health is a priority.”
Missouri Republicans included the tax break on period supplies, along with diapers and incontinence products, in a bill passed May 7 that also eliminates the state’s capital gains tax. In a statement, Republican House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit called the bill “family first legislation.” Gov. Mike Kehoe is expected to sign it.
“Cutting taxes on diapers and feminine hygiene products affects ALL Missouri families,” the statement said, “and will have the greatest positive impact with low-income women and girls across Missouri.”
Democrats, too, have supported cutting taxes on necessities like period products and diapers. They did not support this bill because of the capital gains tax provision, which they argued will largely benefit wealthy Missourians and leave the state in fiscal peril.
But getting rid of the tax on period products and diapers is the right thing to do, said Rep. Jo Doll, a St. Louis County Democrat, who for five years has introduced legislation to remove the tax on menstrual products and diapers.
“The concept that we’re taxing basic necessities as luxury items just seems absurd,” she said.
“I’m sure if you talk to anyone who uses diapers or period products, they can tell you they are not a luxury.”
 Growing awareness

Missouri is one of 20 states that still charge sales tax on period products.
Period, Swanigan’s organization, estimates that Kansas collects just over $3 million annually on taxes assessed on period product sales, while Missouri brings in close to $8 million, a sliver of the state’s $53 billion budget.
Kansas lawmakers have also considered legislation to do away with that state’s tax on period products, but so far that effort has failed.
Still, advocates said, the fact that red states like Missouri and Kansas are considering the issue at all is evidence of growing awareness about “period poverty,” the lack of access to affordable menstrual products. Alabama also recently passed a bill to eliminate its state tampon tax.
Experts said the COVID pandemic may have helped fuel awareness. Supply chain issues and lack of access to products at schools and other public places during the pandemic made the problem even more pronounced and harder to ignore.
Awareness helps in finding a solution to a problem that in past generations was rarely discussed, especially in public, Swanigan said. People are starting to see period products as an essential need, like medicine or food, she said.
“Even within the last two to five years, we’ve seen an increase in understanding about this issue,” Swanigan said. “That’s good news for future policy changes that could help more people.”
In addition to calling for an end to all sales taxes on these products — counties and cities tax them, too — Period wants to see government programs like Medicaid cover them. Food assistance programs like SNAP and WIC do not.
 Consequences

A 2023 survey commissioned by Period and Thinx Inc. found that a quarter of teens and one-third of adults struggled to pay for period products, which have been soaring in price. According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, the price of tampons went up 36% between 2019 and 2024, while the cost of sanitary pads rose 41%.
It’s a major financial strain for many families, said Jeanette Higgins, a nurse practitioner at Children’s Mercy Hospital.
“Especially for low socioeconomic households,” Higgins said, “they may be forced to choose between buying a menstrual product or buying food.”
The rising cost of menstrual products may be part of the reason Giving the Basics, a Kansas City-area nonprofit that provides pads, tampons and other hygiene supplies to shelters, food pantries and schools, has seen a sharp jump in demand for them.
In 2024, the organization distributed 750,000 period products around Kansas, Missouri and 18 other states. That was a 56% jump from the previous year, said Ashley Allison, the organization’s marketing coordinator.
“It’s one of our most requested products for sure,” she said. “It’s a huge need.”
Other Kansas City organizations, including Giving Hope & Help Inc.  and Strawberry Week, also work on raising awareness and making supplies available to people in need.
When people can’t afford proper supplies to manage their periods they often miss work, which has economic consequences. Kids also miss school and school-related activities. That not only can cause them to fall behind in their classes, it can lead to depression and anxiety, Higgins said.
“Fearing that when they have their period, are they going to have a product?” Higgins said. “Are they going to have to miss an activity or have to miss school?”
Giving the Basics donates period products to 1,028 schools in Missouri and Kansas, including the Independence School District. Lori Halsey, that district’s director of health services, said she wants every student to know they are welcome to take as much as they need for themselves and their family. In addition to donations from Giving the Basics, Halsey said the district relies on grants and funding from the state education department to meet the need.
“It is a struggle for girls to not have that resource,” Halsey said.
There are also health consequences. The 2023 survey from Period found that 40% of teens and more than half of adults have worn period products longer than recommended.
Higgins said using a pad or tampon too long can lead to infections or serious illness. Improvising with supplies not intended for that use can also cause infections, she said.
 Ending stigma

While more schools provide free products to students, asking for them can be intimidating, especially for teens. Stigma is another major hurdle in the fight to end period poverty.
“Girls, especially young girls, have a lot of trouble just even talking about periods,” Higgins said. “Having to go to the nurse to discuss their period cannot be comfortable to begin with, and then they have to discuss why they don’t have products available to them.”
That’s why period products should be free and widely available, said Jessica McClellan, founder and president of Giving Hope & Help, a Kansas City organization that donates pads, tampons and other care items to people in need.
Just as people can find free toilet paper in virtually any public restrooms, she said, people should also find free menstrual supplies. And the world should stop being afraid to talk about periods.
“There’s power in the period,” McClellan said, as she walked around her organization’s Midtown storage room, stocked floor to ceiling with pads, tampons and other hygiene products destined for schools, domestic violence shelters and, sometimes, communities on the other side of the world.
“This is not a woman’s health problem,” she said. “This is a world health care problem that we can easily solve. And it’s a world health care problem that’s right here in Kansas City.”

(Ciattarelli photo by Amanda Burns/Spadea photo by Hal Brown)Bill Spadea, the Republican former radio host running to become New Jersey’s next governor, said learning that he would not be getting President Donald Trump’s endorsement was like a punch to the gut.
Spadea was walking into a campaign event Monday night when he received a phone call from Bill Stepien, who ran Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, telling him Trump would be endorsing Spadea’s chief rival in the GOP primary, Jack Ciattarelli.
Spadea said he hadn’t seen that coming. But, he said, by the next morning, he woke up to hundreds of texts of support, dozens of new volunteers signed up, and a flood of new, low-dollar donations.
“It exposed this incredible groundswell, thousands of people reaching out. I don’t know that I would have heard from all those people if they didn’t feel the need to say, ‘Wait a minute. This is ridiculous — you’re the Trump guy.’ So I’m very pleased about that,” Spadea said Thursday following a lunch event with the Women’s Republican Club Mantoloking-Bay Head.
Spadea and Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman who has twice before sought the governor’s seat, have spent months dueling for the support of Trump and the president’s supporters. Trump on Monday posted his endorsement of Ciattarelli on social media, calling Ciattarelli “a terrific America First candidate.” Ciattarelli called himself “truly humbled and honored” to receive Trump’s endorsement.
Speaking to voters at Charlie’s of Bay Head Thursday, Spadea compared Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli to a priest at a funeral giving remarks for someone they didn’t know. He said Trump endorsed “a poll, not a person.”
Several polls have shown for much of the race that Ciattarelli is the clear front-runner in the five-man GOP primary. An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill poll released Thursday puts Ciattarelli at 44% and Spadea in second place at 18%. The poll says 23% of respondents were undecided.
“The guys around the president want it easy. They’re like, ‘Oh, Mr. President, look at this, he’s 20 points down. He can’t win,’” Spadea said. “Really? Because I remember 2016, when Hillary Clinton had a 98% chance of becoming the president.”

Asked to comment, Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell called Spadea’s remarks “just more BS.”
“The fact of the matter is that Spadea is losing this race by a landslide because of his harsh attacks on President Trump and his lying smears against Jack Ciattarelli. If Spadea thinks it’s a good idea to double down on that failed strategy, more power to him. Jack is focused on uniting the party and working with President Trump to fix our state,” Russell said.
Ciattarelli was the Republican nominee for governor in 2021, losing to Gov. Phil Murphy in a close race.
Less than four weeks remain until June 10, when voters will decide who wins the Democratic and Republican nominations for governor in the fall. Murphy, a Democrat, will leave office in January and is barred from seeking a third consecutive term. In addition to the five-man GOP race to succeed him, six Democrats are vying for their party’s nomination.
While Spadea said Thursday he’s disappointed he wasn’t endorsed by Trump, he believes it’ll hurt Ciattarelli in the long run. He cited candidates with Trump’s endorsement who lost their elections, including Christine Serrano Glassner in last year’s U.S. Senate primary in New Jersey.
Candidates need to have a “certain character, strength, principles in order to capitalize on making that endorsement something,” Spadea said.
“Our plan aligns with his plan, so it would have been a real match,” he said. “So, it would’ve helped me. It’s not going to help Jack the way he thinks.”

While the state of Connecticut suggests “that homeschooling parents complete the Intent to Homeschool form for each child annually and submit it to the Superintendent’s office for signature”, the form is not mandatory. 
In the past three school years, the rate of children exiting the public school system to homeschooling has been less than 0.5% annually of all students in Connecticut public schools, according to a recent report by the Connecticut Department of Education. About 22% of these had been identified for special education prior to their exit, according to the report. 
The rate of children transferring to homeschooling has had a small decline, from 0.4% in the 2021-2022 school year to 0.3% in school years 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. According to the 2025 report, 1,857 children were homeschooled across the state of Connecticut in the 2023-2024 school year.
The numbers of children who transferred to homeschooling do not include children who were never enrolled in public schools.
The optional “Intent to Homeschool” form is sent to school districts. Some parents notify their district that they are continuing homeschooling from the previous year, or that they have children who were never enrolled in school in the first place. For example, the Connecticut Department of Education reported that in Bridgeport, 56 children exited from public schools in the 2023-2024 school year. Bridgeport Public Schools told the CT Mirror they knew of 90 children who were homeschooled that year, which includes children whose parents submitted the Intent to Homeschool form.
The CT mirror contacted 10 of the state’s biggest school districts as well as some in the Greater Hartford area. Of the districts that provided five years’ worth of data, three reported slight decreases in the number of homeschooled children in 2024-2025 compared to 2020-2021, while two reported that homeschooling remained steady. Their data include children who may have unenrolled and reenrolled.
School districts do not have a way of accounting for children who were never in the system. 
“There may be more students who live in the Norwalk community who are homeschooled, but we cannot track them unless they entered our district at some point,” according to an email from Norwalk Public Schools. 
According to the 2024 Household Pulse Survey data, a U.S. Census survey conducted across nine two-week cycles in 2024, the actual number of homeschoolers may be higher. The survey estimated that 3% of Connecticut adults living with K-12 children who reported their school enrollment type are homeschooling. There were also many adults surveyed who did not report their children’s enrollment type.
According to the Household Pulse Survey’s 2023-2024 data, 6% of children nationally are homeschooled. Connecticut is one of 30 states that does not collect or report homeschool participation data.
According to the CT Homeschool Network, “CHN has grown over the decades to around 25,000 CT families,” but this number also includes families who are not currently homeschooling their children.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)With roughly a month left of the legislative session, some big ticket bills are starting to be set aside until next year. Requests for bills that committees hope to carry over to the 2026 session are supposed to be due to the presiding officers on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Maine Senate and House of Representatives have been busy with marathon voting sessions.
To start, lawmakers this week backed a bill (LD 702) that would officially designate Jan. 6 as a Day to Remember, which if the governor allows the bill to become law will require an annual proclamation “honoring the resilience of democracy during the events of January 6, 2021 in Washington, D.C.,” and encouraging education and civic organizations to observe the day with discussions and events. Before passing the House 74-65, the legislation prompted passionate debate over whether the designation is an important record of the U.S. Capitol riot or if it would be divisive. The Senate voted 20-14 in support.
Other votes of note: 
Following the House vote last week, senators voted 20-12 to reject a bill (LD 187) that would prohibit public sector labor unions from imposing mandatory service fees on nonmembers, otherwise known as a “right to work bill.” 
A labor bill that did pass the Legislature this week is LD 54, which requires employers to disclose pay ranges and maintain records of employees’ pay histories.
Both chambers backed legislation (LD 407) directing the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, which operates the former Brunswick Naval Air Station, to take steps to purge the property of firefighting foam containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, by Dec. 31, 2026. (More on that here and here).
Following passage in the House, the Senate voted 17-15 to back legislation (LD 328), “An Act Requiring the State to Pay a Retired State Employee’s or Retired Teacher’s Premium for Medicare Part B Under Medicare Advantage.” Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), who co-chairs the Labor Committee, said the measure is in part a response to the cut and capping of cost-of-living adjustments for retired teachers and other state employees.
Legislation (LD 792) to provide one-time funding to support a research project to evaluate the impact of access for cancer patients to specific dietary services died in what is called non-concurrence after both chambers could not agree on whether to pass or reject the bill (the House was against, Senate for). 
The Senate voted 20-13 and the House 75-64 to back a bill (LD 700) that requires the University of Maine System to waive tuition and fees for eligible full-time students to make up the difference between costs and federal Pell Grants and other financial aid.
Legislation (LD 14) to provide any member of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or band in Maine is not required to pay a fee for admission to any state-owned park, historic site, camping area or beach managed by the State passed the Senate unanimously before passing the House 121-18.
Rebuffing the majority of the financial services committee’s opposition, the Senate voted 21-13 and the House 73-69 in favor of an amended version of LD 163, which requires insurance coverage for federally approved nonprescription oral contraceptives and nonprescription emergency contraceptives.
The House and Senate unanimously backed a resolve (LD 270) to establish legislative review of proposed changes to Chapter 850: Health Plan Accountability, a major substantive rule of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance. During the House discussion, Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham) pointed to a portion of the rule that would ensure the name and title of an individual reviewing health insurance claims would not be disclosed publicly, which she said was brought forth after the murder of the UnitedHealth CEO.
Both chambers supported legislation (LD 281) to provide ongoing funds to the Maine Discovery Museum to support the Maine Science Festival, the Maine Invention Convention and the Science Around ME program. 
The chambers are at odds over legislation (LD 828) that would allow chiropractors to be designated as school health advisors. After being rejected by the House by a 77-63 vote, senators accepted an amended version of the bill that specifies that chiropractors can provide physical examinations of students.
The House and Senate are also split over a bill (LD 1013) that would require voter approval if a municipality is seeking to issue a $10 million or more bond. The Senate voted 18-16 in favor of the bill while the House rejected the measure by a vote of 74-68.
And the chambers are at odds over LD 421, “An Act to Eliminate Barriers to Reentry into the Community After Incarceration by Repealing Certain Driver’s License Suspension Provisions.” After the House killed the bill under the hammer, Sen. Pinney Beebe-Center (D-Knox) asked the Senate to take up the minority report in support of the bill, which it backed 19-15. Supporters said the provision would help formerly incarcerated people rejoin society in productive ways, which would be less likely to lead to recidivism. 
The chambers both rejected bills that would prohibit geoengineering (LD 825); direct the Public Utilities Commission to take steps to reduce the use of natural gas through energy contracts (LD 1251); and a bill that would require municipal approval before the state places noncitizens in a municipality (LD 422), among others.
The House and Senate also voted against labor bills that would roll back several child labor protections regarding the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds can work (LD 644) and extend the hours minors under 16 years old can work (LD 618). More on those here.
Both chambers also rejected a bill (LD 918) that would allow a qualifying religious organization to self-insure for automobile insurance. Sponsor Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said the bill is meant to help Maine’s Mennonite community, explaining that they don’t believe in relying on others, which he said extends to insurance coverage. However, critics said it would leave those on the other side of an automobile accident with fewer protections.

Senate action
Following similar action in the House last week, the Senate voted 21-12 to advance an emergency measure (LD 1948) that would make the funding in the two-year budget for MaineCare available more immediately (more on that here). The body first voted 21-12 to suspend the rules to bypass the committee process. For an emergency provision to pass, it will ultimately require support of two-thirds of both chambers, which is unlikely given Republican opposition. During debate, Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Lewiston) said MaineCare providers across the state “are in crisis because of delayed promised payments…The tragic part of this is we have the funds to make these payments. We need the votes to get the funding out.”
Senators rejected a committee recommendation and backed legislation (LD 125) to raise the maximum annual amount of tax credits the Finance Authority of Maine may issue to investors under the Maine Seed Capital Tax Credit Program from $5 million to $10 million. 
The Senate unanimously backed an emergency bill (LD 1139) to provide ongoing funding of $6 million a year for crime victim services, citing the likelihood that related federal grants may soon be cut. (More on that here).
Senators voted 19-15 to back the committee recommendation against a bill (LD 16) that would establish separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine. While supporters cited the distance that people in that part of the state have to travel, judicial committee chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said they spent a lot of time working on the proposal but ultimately decided that long term operational and fiscal consequences were too concerning to move forward. 
Senators backed a provision (LD 771) that amends the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances. Supporters said the change addresses a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances.
Some of the other bills that passed the Senate under the hammer, without a roll call: 

LD 375 “An Act to Require the University of Maine School of Law to Provide an Online Degree Program”
LD 504 “An Act to Improve Family Court Procedure”
LD 1456 “An Act to Expand the Number of On-premises Retail Liquor Licenses a Liquor Manufacturer May Be Issued”

House action
Members of the House voted 79-62 to reject legislation (LD 542) that would establish municipal property tax levy limits, restoring provisions of a law that was repealed in 2023.
The House voted 75-67 to reject a resolution (LD 492) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to provide for “parental rights.” (More on this here).
Members of the House voted 75-66 to reject LD 451, which would require operators of wind or solar developments to test for PFAS and, if so, determine if contamination was “reasonably caused” by the development.
The House also rejected a bill (LD 878) to study the effects of 5G on wildlife populations and children. During discussion, bill sponsor Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon) said she’s “trying to find answers for constituents.” But chair Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) said the energy committee saw hundreds of studies that showed this is not needed. 
The House voted 77-63 to pass a bill (LD 1080) to prohibit public utilities from requiring deposits based solely on a residential customer’s income. 
Appropriations
Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

LD 461 “An Act to Fund Rural Patrol Services in Washington County”
LD 477 “An Act to Enhance Public Safety in Rural Counties by Providing State Police Patrol and Policing Services”
LD 1061, “An Act to Increase Community Support for Families in Maine”
LD 814 “An Act to Provide Funding to Area Agencies on Aging for Community-based Services and Programs to Support Older Adults”

This week: Nearly 3,0000 grocery store workers threaten strike; paid family and sick leave unscathed in state budget deal; Minnesota employment flat in April; and hundreds of federal workplace safety employees reinstated. 
Nearly 3,0000 grocery store workers threaten strike
Nearly 3,000 workers are headed toward unfair labor practices strikes at 38 grocery stores across the Twin Cities after they rejected the latest offers from UNFI-owned Cub, Haug and Knowlan’s Festival Foods.
It was an unprecedented vote by workers who could walk off the job around Memorial Day if they don’t reach a deal with the companies, according to leaders with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 663.
“They’re not listening. Pure and simple. They’re ignoring everything we’ve suggested,” said Nicolas McBride, assistant meat manager at Haug’s Cub in Minnetonka and member of the bargaining team.
McBride said the companies want to shift more health care costs onto workers, which would more than double his cost and eat up the modest pay raise of $3 per hour spread over the life of the three-year contract.
He also said the companies’ proposed pay raises would only kick in once the contract is ratified, with nothing retroactive to when the contract expired in March. That would add up to hundreds of dollars for workers.
“I’ve been in the union for 28 years and every single contract we’ve gotten back pay,” McBride said.
UFCW Local 663 has been negotiating with the companies since January, along with Lunds & Byerlys, Jerry’s Cub Food, Kowalski’s and Radermacher’s Cub Foods. Workers at those four companies ratified contracts over the weekend, averting a strike.
While the offers were similar, UFCW Local 663 President Rena Wong said the companies made good faith efforts to listen to workers and respond to their proposals. For example at Lunds & Bylerlys, workers wanted to raise part-time wages, particularly for the custodial staff.
“They came back and they made that change. They listened,” Wong said. “That is contrary to what UNFI, Haug’s and Knowlan’s did.”
The union has filed an unfair labor practice charge against UNFI with the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private sector unions, alleging the company has not bargained in good faith. The union also alleges Haug’s and Knowlan’s have violated labor protections for collective bargaining.
In a statement, UNFI said it has been negotiating “diligently and in good faith” and has offered “strong wage increases, continued market-leading union health care and significant increases in our contributions to the union’s pension plan.”
Paid family and sick leave unscathed in global budget deal
Paid family leave and earned sick time came out of difficult budget negotiations largely unscathed under a deal announced by legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday. The deal doesn’t have complete buy-in from progressive Senators because it would roll back access to MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults, however. Much could still change between now and the end of the session.
Paid family leave and earned sick time have faced stiff resistance from business leaders, who have found sympathetic ears among moderate Senate Democrats and newly empowered House Republicans in control of half the lower chamber.
The budget agreement would reduce the maximum payroll tax for the paid family leave program from 1.2% to 1.1%. The change may be insignificant since payroll taxes might never rise to the tax cap, depending on how many people claim benefits. The program is slated to start next year with a payroll tax of .88%, with employers paying at least half of the cost.
The tweak is far less significant than cuts proposed by two moderate Democrats and Republicans earlier this year, which would exempt businesses with 15 or fewer employees and reduce the total number of weeks employees could take off in a year from 20 to 14.
Moderate Senate Democrats also recently voted with Republicans to exempt small farms and businesses from providing paid sick and safe time — at least six days a year for full-time employees — among other changes sought by business leaders. That proposal appears to be dead.
Democrats did make concessions on unemployment insurance for hourly school workers, with legislative leaders agreeing to repeal the benefit in 2029.
School districts complained paying for unemployment for school bus drivers, paraprofessionals and cafeteria workers threatens their tight budgets and makes it harder to fill part-time summer positions. Democrats vowed to protect the benefit, although they will have to win back control of state government to do so if the deal becomes law.
Minnesota employment flat in April
Minnesota employment stayed relatively flat in April, losing 1,300 jobs out of about 3 million statewide, according to data released by the state Department of Employment and Economic Development on Thursday.
The labor market has stayed strong despite upheavals in the global economy since President Donald Trump took office and launched a trade war, halted billions in federal funding, and moved to eliminate more than 120,000 federal jobs.
DEED reported 200 federal jobs lost in Minnesota last month, a small percentage of the 18,000 federal employees in the state, not including postal workers and military personnel. Many of the Trump administration’s layoffs have been reversed or paused, while those workers who took the “Fork in the Road” buyout offer won’t show up in the data until they are off the payroll.
“We would expect to see a drop at some point, it’s just hard to say when,” said Angelina Nguyen, director of the labor market information office at DEED.
Unemployment also ticked up slightly to 3.2% in April, mainly due to 3,300 joining the labor force. The unemployment rate remains 1 percentage point lower than the national rate.
Hundreds of federal workplace safety employees reinstated
The Trump administration reinstated hundreds of laid off workers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health this week, including those who screen coal miners for black lung and those who provide services to the first responders to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
The reversal comes after intense public pressure from unions, members of Congress and a lawsuit brought by a coal miner, which led to a federal judge ordering nearly 200 workers be reinstated on Tuesday. The following day, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Congress 328 employees at NIOSH had been reinstated.
Some 900 workers, or more than 90% of the entire agency, were planned to be permanently cut as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s campaign to drastically shrink the size of the federal workforce.
The agency, which is part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, helps reduce workplace injuries and illnesses across industries by investigating workplaces to mitigate exposure to toxins, inspecting personal protective equipment for nurses and firefighters, and tracking cancer in firefighters.
On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO, leading a coalition of unions, filed a lawsuit challenging the dismantling of the agency, saying it would lead to more workers dying on the job.
“Working people have fought too hard for these critical protections to now watch an unelected billionaire dismantle them and take us back to a time when chronic disease and death on the job was commonplace,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/493920792_1264876998972980_257142171735395332_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

You can read more about the section here.

Several years ago, I confronted the possibility that I, like many Mississippians, had been blindsided by cancer.
A routine blood test detected alarmingly high PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels, and after informing me that the odds were about 25% for a positive cancer diagnosis and 60% of that for an intermediate to severe form of the disease, my urologist recommended a biopsy. Those odds represented a 15% probability of a metastatic crisis, and given the low risks associated with prostate biopsies, I opted for the procedure.
After an anxious week of waiting, the pathologist’s report indicated that I had dodged the terrifying reality of cancer—unlike for the roughly 16,000 Mississippians who are diagnosed with cancer each year, with an associated annual death toll of about 6,500. 
I am a retired scientist and although my area of expertise involves field biology, my research background helped me evaluate the medical options and procedures related to prostate cancer. I could understand the relevant scientific papers and search for qualities that define good medical research: testable hypotheses, large sample sizes, replicate studies, appropriate statistical analyses and peer-reviewed papers published in reputable journals. When evaluating my options I could avoid ideologically-based claims like those promising that cod liver oil and  other vitamin A supplements are effective for preventing and treating measles.
I also understood that although the initial blood test for PSA antigens, preliminary MRI and biopsy were technological procedures, those procedures were developed through painstaking scientific research—the kinds of research carried out by institutions like the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s (UMMC) Cancer Institute, but now threatened by cuts to federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute and National Science Foundation (NSF).

In other words, the Trump administration is directly harming the kinds of scientific research that could improve the lives of those 16,000 Mississippians who are diagnosed with cancer each year.
In 2023, the UMMC received almost $97 million in research grants, awards and contracts, much of which came from federal funding sources. Cutting NIH funding to the UMMC and other American research institutions threatens the well-being of all Mississippians, regardless of their political affiliation, age, sex, gender, race or ethnicity—or whether their health is threatened by cancer, sickle-cell anemia, heart disease, diabetes, traumatic injury or poor delivery of medical services to underserved populations. Who among us doesn’t know multiple people whose lives have been affected by those diseases or problems? Ironically, it seems that cuts to NIH funding  likely will hit “red states” like Mississippi the hardest. 
Scientific research is a human endeavor, conducted by fallible human beings, as we all are. And yet the core scientific process, which relies on experimental and observational studies, verifiable data and hypotheses that can be tested by multiple independent observers, is the only truly self-correcting discipline—one that rises above the (occasional) false leads, mistakes and pettiness of its individual practitioners to improve the quality of life for everyone.
The scientific process is why we no longer believe that cancer is caused by an excess of black bile, as did physicians in the Middle Ages. We now have targeted gene therapies that dramatically increase survival rates for many types of cancers. It is why we no longer believe that malaria is transmitted by humid and stale air.
And it is why we embrace the germ theory of disease; use antibiotics to treat a variety of diseases, from syphilis to tuberculosis; and employ vaccines to prevent or diminish the damage caused by polio, measles, rubella, whooping cough: on and on and on. The medical benefits derived from high-quality scientific research is one critical reason that average life expectancy in the United States rose from roughly 40 years in 1860 to almost 79 years in 2020. 
Of course, federal researchers and research dollars benefit many other aspects of life in Mississippi besides those related to health care. Proposed cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, which could affect as much as 50% of the workforce at some stations (there are four such stations in Mississippi, supporting research projects on everything from cotton ginning to poultry and insect pest management), would harm the productivity and competitiveness of Mississippi farmers.
Proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—54% in the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 funding bill—will hamper the ability of the EPA to clean up Mississippi’s nine active Superfund sites, which contain toxic chemicals like PCBs and dioxins.
Or take the impacts of proposed cuts to scientific research by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Mississippi Gulf Coast is imperiled by rising sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico (almost 2°F between 1970 to 2020), driving increasingly powerful hurricanes, and a sea level rise of up to 10 millimeters/per year, which translates into almost 4 inches of sea level rise per decade, which in turn increases storm-driven flooding. Consequently, along Mississippi’s Gulf Coast homeowner’s insurance is becoming more and more expensive, while the nonrenewal rate by insurance companies is increasing.
Even if one does not “believe” in human-driven climate change, it remains imperative to study sea levels and sea surface temperatures to help protect against the harmful effects of increasingly powerful tropical storms—and the equally damaging effects on homeowner’s insurance rates and availability for Gulf Coast Mississippians.
It also is crucial that we understand the costs of extreme weather events, those causing at least $1 billion dollars, to help insurance companies, policymakers and scientists understand major disasters like the hurricanes that batter the Guld Coast of Mississippi—and yet NOAA will no longer collect these data.
Although scientific research is not primarily a jobs or economic stimulus program, federal research and development funding also contributes in vital ways to overall economic growth, maintaining America’s competitiveness on the world stage and our country’s high standard of living.
Recent analyses suggest that net economic returns for federal research and development dollars are much higher than for other forms of investment such as for physical infrastructure, and may be responsible for as much as 25% of post-World War II productivity and growth—and that contrary to claims by the current administration, public research investments are not less productive than private investments. 
I could describe many more examples of benefits provided by federal science funding, but I will end with one perplexing but illustrative story. Last February, President Trump ordered the release of billions of gallons of water from California reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ostensibly to benefit Central Valley farmers and help Los Angeles fight wildfires like those that devastated the area in January. However, there were no scientific justifications for President Trump’s order, as related to hydrology, irrigation or wildfire suppression
 Still, one Central Valley farmer stated that although the water release was counterproductive, “I have a conservative mindset. I encourage the trigger-pulling attitude, like: ‘Hey, let’s just get stuff done.”
Maybe there are occasions when a “trigger-pulling attitude” is appropriate. But when the gun is aimed at your own head, the results will be predictable and catastrophic—whether we’re talking ill-considered water releases from California dams or indiscriminate and draconian cuts to federal scientific agencies and research funding, which will harm the citizens of Mississippi in so many ways.

Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday told Congress the Trump administration would not cut funding for Head Start, after layoffs at the agency and funding freezes raised fears the six-decade-old program would be radically downsized.
In an appearance before a Senate subcommittee, Kennedy said the administration would “emphasize healthy eating in Head Start, and ensure the program continues to serve its 750,000 children and parents effectively.”
The early education program, which serves children from low-income and homeless families around the country, grapples with staffing shortages and many centers operate in a perpetual state of financial precarity.
[RELATED: New England Head Start office closed; federal funding in flux]
While the program has been spared from elimination, Kennedy has laid off a significant number of employees who helped the program operate and shuttered half its regional offices. Providers have experienced repeated funding delays since President Donald Trump took office, forcing some to briefly close.
In a tense exchange, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, pressed Kennedy on why the federal government delayed sending funding to a Head Start operation outside Milwaukee, forcing it to close.
“What would you say to a parent who shows up for … Head Start and the doors are closed?” she asked him.
“I would be very sad,” Kennedy said. “I fought very hard to make sure Head Start gets all of its funding next year.”
Asked what was causing the delays, Kennedy said he did not know, but suggested the problem came from employees “who wanted to make the Trump administration look bad.”

That’s had a negative impact on commercial property values, which are linked to property taxes that the city depends on. Mayoral candidate Josh Kraft, a nonprofit executive and son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, said city officials should put “everything on the table to bring sources of revenue to the city,” including incentivizing businesses to move to Boston.  Wu said city budget officials are “cinching our belt even tighter,” exercising fiscal discipline by cutting hundreds of jobs that have been vacant. But she also took her first shot of the night at Kraft, pointing to his stance that the city should cut two percent from the budget. That translates into cutting police, fire and city services, she said.Kraft in turn panned her argument that the city couldn’t find small amounts in a $4.6 billion budget that can be cut. “I just find that hard to believe,” he said. “It’s easy to stand on the sidelines when you’re new to the city, new to city policymaking and say cut cut cut and not say from where,” Wu shot back, referring to Kraft moving into Boston in late 2023, ahead of his mayoral run. Two other candidates on the stage – Hyde Park activist Domingos DaRosa and Alex Alex, who decided to run after he was unable to get a city job – had their own ideas. DaRosa said the city should extract more money out of tourists who come into the city, and he suggested conducting an audit to root out misappropriated spending, while Alex suggested stricter traffic enforcement and the implementation of congestion pricing, which charges drivers a fee if they enter the city at certain times of the day. The concept has seen success this year in New York City. The mayoral forum, which lasted roughly two hours, was put together by Democratic groups and moderated by GBH News reporter Saraya Wintersmith. Wu and Kraft are so far the only candidates who have gathered more than the 3,000 signatures needed to qualify for the ballot, while another dozen have expressed interest in running. If more than two candidates get enough voter signatures by May 20, the city plans to hold a nonpartisan preliminary in September, which will winnow the field to two finalists in November. The candidates also touched on K-12 education and higher education. Asked for their priorities on improving Boston Public Schools, Wu noted that the pandemic disrupted school learning, but attendance and graduation rates are up. Kraft said he would focus on increasing literacy rates, especially in the younger grades, and expand access to vocational education.  As for the colleges and universities that power Boston’s economy, Kraft defended their focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which has come under attack from the Trump administration. “DEI is a crucial part of education because the more diverse an administration is, professorships are, the more you learn, the more experiences you can share with students so people have a deeper understanding,” he said. Wu said Boston should continue speaking up against the Trump administration to “create space” for universities to stand up against intimidation from Washington, D.C. DaRosa said he would like to see universities pay more in taxes to the city, while Alex called the Trump crackdown on higher education the “perfect opportunity” to reshape academia, which has benefited from the slave trade and been the “lapdogs of tyrants.” All the mayoral contenders were asked which Boston ward they live in. The boundaries of wards, a combination of precincts, are used to define key political sections in cities and towns. Wu, who lives in Roslindale, said Ward 18, as did Hyde Park’s DaRosa. “I’m embarrassed to say I don’t know,” said Kraft. Alex, who lives in Dorchester, also said he didn’t know. As the forum wrapped up, Wu leaned over to Kraft and held up three fingers, letting him know he lives in Ward 3.The post City finances top of mind in early days for Boston mayoral candidates appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250515_200822.jpg?fit=1024%2C862&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight, via EcoFlight)Production at South Dakota’s only active, large-scale gold mine climbed to its highest level in eight years, according to a new 2024 annual report.
The Wharf Mine, owned by Chicago-based Coeur Mining, is near the city of Lead and the Terry Peak Ski Area in the northern Black Hills. The mine produced 98,042 ounces of gold last year — nearly 5,000 ounces more than the prior year.
The mine also produced 232,013 ounces of silver, which is a lesser-value “co-product” of the gold mining process. Silver production was down about 36,000 ounces from an usually high level in 2023.
To extract all of those minerals last year, miners stripped away 12.9 million tons of earth to access 5 million tons of ore.
State regulators issued a warning letter to the mine in 2021 about selenium pollution in False Bottom Creek, which flows within the mine’s boundaries. Selenium is a naturally occurring mineral in soil, but when it’s turned loose in the environment in large amounts, it can pollute water and be harmful to people and fish.
A staff member for the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources said Thursday during a meeting of the state Board of Minerals and Environment that the company is building a new water treatment plant to address the problem. The plant is expected to be operational by October.
The annual report says the mine employs 255 people and paid $12.5 million in state precious-metal severance taxes last year, plus nearly $800,000 in state and local sales taxes.
Coeur Mining’s annual report for investors says it sold $227.6 million worth of gold from the Wharf Mine last year, and $6.4 million worth of silver, for a total of $234 million. That was a 25% increase from 2023.
From those proceeds, the company said it made donations to 55 Black Hills-area entities, such as nonprofits and school groups, totaling $220,000.
The company operates additional mines in Nevada, Alaska and Mexico, and reported total 2024 precious-metal sales of more than $1 billion.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0415-scaled-e1684864040881-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

His appointment signals a new chapter for the Office of the Marijuana Commissioner (OMC), the regulatory agency tasked with implementing and enforcing the Delaware Marijuana Control Act, which took effect on July 5, 2023.
OMC’s mission is to oversee the adult-use and medical marijuana industry with a focus on public health, preventing underage use, ensuring equity, and generating tax revenue through a safe and well-regulated market.
Sanderlin brings over 15 years of experience advising businesses, investors, and policymakers on marijuana regulation and public policy. As principal of Sanderlin Strategies, he has worked across multiple jurisdictions to support licensing, compliance, and the development of marijuana programs. Previously, he practiced law at Greenberg Traurig, where he represented clients in regulatory and legislative matters.
“Josh Sanderlin’s depth of regulatory experience and his focus on equity and transparency will be critical as we create a system that protects public health, promotes opportunity, and delivers on the promise of responsible legalization,” said Governor Matt Meyer.
Sanderlin holds a Juris Doctor from the Catholic University of America, a Master of Public Administration from Florida State University, and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Jacksonville University. He is widely respected for his commitment to transparency, equity, and good governance in emerging industries.
OMC also recognizes the leadership of Deputy Commissioner Paul Hyland, who has played a key role in advancing the state’s marijuana program during the transitional period. “OMC is excited to welcome Commissioner Sanderlin and to hear his vision for the future of this office,” said Hyland.
“I’m honored to serve as Delaware’s Marijuana Commissioner,” said Sanderlin. “I look forward to working with the dedicated team at OMC and partners across the marijuana industry to build a safe, well-regulated market that delivers real justice and lasting benefits to all Delawareans.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Senate voted to enact new rules to streamline the voting process in Alaska and expand voter access. If signed into law, the legislation would update the state’s voter rolls, mandate that the state pay for postage for mailed ballots, introduce a new ballot tracking system, and repeal a requirement that a witness sign absentee ballots, among other changes. 
The Senate passed Senate Bill 64 along caucus lines, voting 14 to 6 on Monday. The bill now moves to the House for consideration in the last week of the legislative session. 
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and a bill supporter, called it a “compromise bill” years in the making at a news conference on Tuesday. “It includes 12 different bills that have been introduced over the years from members of all political parties — Republicans, Democrats, independents, minority and majority members,” he said. “Roughly 50% of the bill is at the request of the minority in the House and the Senate. So it is truly a compromise bill.”
Wielechowski said the first goal of the bill is to update the state’s voter rolls. “We have 106% more registered voters in the state than we have citizens, and so it takes some steps to fix that,” he said.
 
 Under SB 64, the Division of Elections would send a notice to confirm address if the voter has: 

Registered to vote in a another state
Received a driver’s license in another state
Registered a vehicle in another state
Served on a jury in another state
Obtained a resident hunting or fishing license in another state
Pays resident tuition at at university in another state
Receives a residential property tax exemption in another state
Receives public assistance in another state 



If passed, the bill clarifies residency as “as a place where a voter has a reasonable and articulable plan to return to whenever they are absent.” The bill would shorten the timeframe in which Alaskans are marked as inactive voters and can ultimately be removed from the voter rolls if they don’t vote. It also would expand the list of things that trigger notices to start that removal process.
Once those notices are sent, the voter will have a chance to respond within 45 days, or be moved to an inactive status for a period of 28 months, or two elections. In that time, a voter can confirm residency and their voter registration by contacting the division, or by voting. 
Wielechowski said the bill addresses the causes of ballots being disqualified, by eliminating the witness signature requirement for absentee ballots and allowing mistakes to be corrected ahead of Election Day. 
“It fixes a number of issues that have resulted in voters’ ballots being thrown out, particularly military voters, and particularly those in rural Alaska: There’s a witness signature problem,” he said. 
Wielechowski pointed to House District 18, which includes Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, as having the highest rate of reject ballots in the last election. 
In the 2024 general election, the state rejected 1,303 absentee ballots, or 1.7% of ballots cast. Nearly 40%, or 512 ballots were rejected due to “improper or insufficient witnessing.” That was fewer than the special election in 2022 following the death of U.S. Rep. Don Young, when over 7,500 ballots were rejected, with a third of those due to a lack of witness signature. 
If passed, the bill would allow for voters to fix minor errors, with the division notifying and allowing the voter an opportunity to correct a mistake before Election Day, a process called “ballot curing.”  
The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, which advocates for civil and voter rights, has been calling for both items, and supports the bill, according to Michael Garvey, its policy director.
“We’ve seen it lead to completely unnecessary rejections,” he said. 
He noted that rejection rates have been higher in rural districts, as well as districts with higher proportions of Alaska Native voters.
“And so someone who’s taken the time to fill out their ballot, put it in the mail, put a stamp on it, and a lot of cases to have that rejected, and then just to be notified that it didn’t end up counting, that’s pretty dispiriting,” Garvey said. “And so the state really should have a way to allow voters to fix that small amount of mistakes.”
The ACLU filed a lawsuit in 2022 asserting the state violated due process rights when rejecting ballots without notice or opportunity to correct errors. The Alaska Superior Court denied the motion in a January ruling, but said that the Legislature could enact a “notice-and-cure system.”
Under the legislation, voters would be notified of technical mistakes before an election and be able to correct them. Voters would not be able to open the envelope and change their vote, but be able to fix external mistakes, such as missing a signature. The division would notify the voter within 24 hours, by email or phone number, and the voter would be able to provide identification and correct the mistake by filling out and submitting a form.
The bill also establishes a new ballot tracking system, so voters can be notified when their ballot is received and counted. It also provides for paid postage for all absentee ballots.
Other new provisions in the bill include:

Adding tribal identification cards to the list of acceptable voter identification in person and by mail;
Removing hunting and fishing licenses from the list of voter identification; 
Establishing a new rural community liaison position within the Division of Elections to support rural districts, including recruitment and training of poll workers;
Requiring that secure ballot drop boxes be available at every division office, and allowing municipalities to provide drop boxes in accordance with division regulations;
Requiring the state to develop a cybersecurity program, and notify the public if there is a data breach;
Requiring that absentee ballot counting start 12 days before the election; and
Requiring the division to publish results for all rankings in the precinct results.

The Division of Elections has estimated that if passed, the bill’s new provisions, staff salaries and cost of paid postage would cost $765,000 in one-time costs and $190,000 annually. 
However, Republican members of the Senate objected to what they say is not enough security protocols to prevent opportunities for voter fraud.
“We have a moniker: You want to make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat,” said Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla in an interview Thursday. “I want to be clear that I’ve never said fraud swung an election. I said I want to make sure we don’t have the potential for fraud, which I think the Division of Elections director agrees with.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXShower said he opposed removing the witness signature, without another kind of verification check. “We suggested several things, like doing what the Permanent Fund Division, use their data, have two attesters… (who) under the penalty of perjury, would have to attest that yes, you are, in fact, her (the voter),” he said, and it was rejected by the bills sponsors. 
Shower also opposed several items, including ballot drop boxes, and has concerns about the language around residency and whether voter rolls are accurate or updated. He said he also has concerns that mail-in absentee ballots present a scenario where they’re fraudulently filled out, and the division cannot verify the true identity of the voter. “Who knows where they went? Who knows how many of them came back? We have no idea,” he said. 
Opponents of these proposals have pointed out that there isn’t much evidence of Alaskans committing the crime of voter fraud. The state has investigated a few cases – the current system catches when two ballots are submitted for the same voter, which has been extremely rare, and can result when a voter forgets that they had already cast a mailed ballot. 
Shower said he’s concerned about personal data breaches like in 2020, where an estimated 113,000 voters’ personal data was exposed, and he wants to see the state take more serious security protocols.
The bill is now being heard in the House Finance Committee and is expected to move to a full House vote in the final days of the session, which ends May 21.

(Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — A condemned inmate is scheduled for execution in one of his two death penalty cases, the state Supreme Court said in a Friday order.
Stephen Stanko, 57, is set to be put to death at 6 p.m. June 13. His execution would be the sixth in the state since the process resumed in September following an unintended 13-year hiatus.
  Stephen Stanko, 57, is scheduled to be executed June 13. (Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)
Stanko was sentenced to death twice, in two separate cases for crimes committed within two days of each other in 2005.
The U.S. Supreme Court turned down his final appeal for a 2009 conviction earlier this month. Appeals are ongoing in his other death sentence, which a jury recommended as part of a 2006 conviction.
By law, Stanko will have until May 30, two weeks before he’s set to die, to choose his method of execution.
The death warrant comes as attorneys raise questions about the state’s protocols for execution by firing squad, an option added by legislators in 2021. Two inmates in the last two months chose to die that way.
In the most recent execution, which took place April 11, marksmen mostly missed inmate Mikal Mahdi’s heart, attorneys claimed.
An autopsy photo showed two bullet holes in his chest where attorneys would have expected three, one from each gun shot at him, attorneys said in a filing to the state Supreme Court last week.
Prison officials have said nothing went wrong. Fragments of bullets struck Mahdi’s heart, and two bullets hit the same spot and took the same trajectory through his body, explaining the two wounds, said prisons spokeswoman Chrysti Shain.
Stanko also has the option to die by lethal injection, which three of the five inmates executed in the last eight months chose, or electrocution, which no inmate in the state has selected since 2008.
Stanko’s crime spree started April 7, 2005, when he strangled his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death at her home in Murrell’s Inlet while beating and raping her 15-year-old daughter, according to court documents. Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before stealing jewelry and credit cards and fleeing.
He went to his friend’s house in Conway. After having breakfast with his friend Henry Turner, Stanko shot the 74-year-old in the back while he shaved in the bathroom mirror, using a pillow as a silencer for his gun, according to court documents.
Stanko then hit Turner in the head and fatally shot him in the chest.
Driving Turner’s truck, Stanko went to Columbia, where he spent an evening buying people drinks at bars before traveling to Augusta, Georgia. There, Stanko convinced a woman he was a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament and went home with her, according to court records.
Stanko stayed with the woman, including attending church with her, until April 12, when he left abruptly in the middle of the night. Soon after he left, the woman recognized his photo in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death and called the police, who captured Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
During Stanko’s trials, defense attorneys argued to no avail that he was insane at the time of the killings, with decreased brain functioning making him unable to understand right and wrong.
A jury convicted Stanko in 2006 of killing Ling and beating and raping her daughter. A separate jury convicted him in 2009 of killing Turner. Both juries recommended death sentences, which multiple courts have affirmed.
Turner’s killing is the crime for which Stanko is set to be put to death in June.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

Financial institutions serving Delaware’s underserved neighborhoods now have a new opportunity to support local economic growth, thanks to a newly launched state fund aimed at increasing access to capital in low- to moderate-income areas.
The Delaware Council on Banking has opened applications for the Delaware Community Investment Venture Fund (DCIVF), a program designed to help banks, credit unions, and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) develop and deploy innovative financial products in communities that have historically lacked access to capital and financial services.
“The Delaware Community Investment Venture Fund reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering equitable economic development across the state,” said Governor Matt Meyer. “By providing targeted support to financial institutions serving low-to-moderate-income communities, we are strengthening the foundation for inclusive growth and long-term prosperity in Delaware.”

Eligible institutions can apply for grants that support projects aimed at developing and testing new financial products, underwriting tools, or services.
The goal is to enhance access to funding and capital for businesses operating in underserved areas.
“I created the community investment venture fund to build an economic ecosystem that provides more access to capital,” said Sen. Darius Brown, D-Wilmington. “Commerce is the life’s blood of our economy and through intentional investments, we are the place where opportunity lives.”
Applications for the DCIVF opened on May 15, and must be submitted by 5 p.m. on June 16.
An optional virtual information session will be held on May 22 at 3 p.m. for interested applicants.
“The Fund aligns with our regulatory priorities of ensuring fair access to financial services and strengthening the safety and soundness of institutions serving vulnerable communities,” said State Bank Commissioner Robert Glen. “We encourage banks, credit unions, and CDFIs to apply.”

Assanis, who has served as the University’s 28th president since 2016, announced his plans to step down on June 30.
Carlson, who joined UD in 2022 as its 12th provost, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to lead the institution during the transition period.
According to Kelly, the board will launch a national search for a permanent president during the upcoming academic year.
As provost, Carlson has played a central role in advancing the University’s academic mission.
Her initiatives have included integrating long-term financial, enrollment and hiring strategies, expanding academic offerings, and fostering innovation through programs like the New Program Incubator and the One Idea, One Slide Summit.
She has also been an advocate for improving academic spaces and creating flexible pathways for students to complete their degrees.
Before joining UD, Carlson held multiple leadership roles over more than two decades at the University of Notre Dame.
Her career there included service as vice president, associate provost, and dean of the Graduate School, where she emphasized holistic student development and strategic planning.
An expert in spatial cognition, Carlson holds a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is widely published in her field.
She has served on editorial boards of leading cognitive science journals and governing boards of professional societies.
The transition marks a pivotal moment for the University as it begins the process of identifying its next permanent leader.
“I am honored and humbled to be stepping in to guide this very special institution, and I thank the Board of Trustees for their confidence and support,” Carlson said. “I look forward to convening campus conversations this summer and fall to reaffirm our mission and identity and to together design a path forward that is uniquely our own.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/provost-carlson-laura-portraits-061022-003-udaily-story-page-800x533-1.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876
