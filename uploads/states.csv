Regina Young (D-Delaware) speaks at a press conference in Tincium Township, Delaware County.. (Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvania hotels, short-term rentals and third-party contractors would have to ensure workers have been trained to recognize and report human trafficking – or risk losing their license to operate – under a measure in the state House. 
HB1286 calls for hospitality personnel to undergo training approved by the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency in consultation with the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association (PRLA) every two years. Employers would have to keep records of worker training or face a fine of $100 for failing to produce them upon request by law enforcement or local licensing authorities. 
Subsequent offenses within every 90 days could result in fines of $250, then $500 and, ultimately, notification of county and/or municipal oversight agencies, according to the legislation sponsored by Rep. Regina Young (D-Delaware). 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Young organized a press conference Tuesday to promote the bill at Governor Printz Park on the Delaware River near Philadelphia International Airport. 
“This problem is intensely focused in our area, where we are so closely connected to the major transportation hubs,” Young said. “We have the Philadelphia International Airport. We have two major interstates, 95 and 76. We also have rail lines. … And so, it’s very important for us to send a blaring message [that] we’re paying attention, and you will no longer be able to go under the radar.”
Forty-three percent of human trafficking convictions in Pennsylvania during 2014-2023 came from cases in or near Philadelphia, according to The Institute to Address Commercial Sexual Exploitation at Villanova University’s Charles Widger School of Law. 
Representatives for hospitality, law enforcement and survivor advocacy organizations joined Young Tuesday. 
So did Democratic Sen. Anthony Williams, whose district encompasses Tinicum Township where the gathering was held, and Rep. Robert Leadbeter (R-Columbia).

“Interstate 80 that runs right through [my] district, and so as with any point of transportation between major … metro or commercial areas, there’s going to be that element of transferability where trafficking then can thrive,” said Leadbeter, one of three GOP cosponsors on the bill. “Whether we’re talking about a rural community … or a community with a high population density – the reality is, this … is something that happens across Pennsylvania.” 
Leadbeter and the others stood across a parking lot from a Holiday Inn Express. Holiday Inn is  among a number of hospitality chains that have for years voluntarily trained staff to recognize and report signs of human trafficking. Large hospitality corporations also have partnered with advocacy organizations like Polaris and PACT to sponsor and develop training programs. 
The Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association currently offers free training materials on its website, according to PRLA President & CEO Joe Massaro. 
“It’s the evolution of something that was purely volunteer, that all the national brands were on board,” said Massaro, noting he’d worked for Hilton for decades before his current role. “Now we want to bring everybody else in the fold.” 
While crucial, training needs to be holistic and consistent, advocates say. 
And its effectiveness will depend on details – such as who conducts it – of the paradigm approved by state’s Commission on Crime and Delinquency, according to Shea Rhodes, co-founder and director of The Institute to Address Commercial Sexual Exploitation at Villanova Law School. 
It’s also one of many necessary reforms remaining, Rhodes said, alongside a larger cultural shift that’s proactively anti-trafficking. 
“It’s necessary to make sure that any space where trafficking is happening, that there are consequences where it’s allowed to happen,” Rhodes said. “We want them to either call the hotline or go through whatever reporting protocol their employer has set.”
Expanding resentencing and restitution laws to advantage trafficking survivors are among legislative proposals highlighted in the most recent annual report from The Institute.
The report also advises combining restitution proceeds into a single fund managed by the state’s Commission on Crime and Delinquency to support mitigation efforts including public education.

Eleven states already mandate hospitality worker training on trafficking awareness, according to a compendium from the nonprofit PACT (Protect All Children from Trafficking). 
North Carolina enacted a training mandate earlier this summer that includes vacation rentals in addition to traditional hotels and lodging facilities, according to PACT, along the lines of how the commonwealth would expand its scope under Young’s measure.
The PACT report highlights Florida’s $2,000-per-day fine for hotels that aren’t training workers. It also notes New Jersey’s law that makes getting, keeping or renewing any permit, license or certificate contingent upon the hotel or motel providing proof of employee training. 
Other states considering training requirements include Washington and Massachusetts, where the House recently sent a bill that would do so to its state Senate.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/human-trafficking-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-05 21:56:59.333824

She faces a backlash from progressive and moderate supporters who are upset with her vote in favor of the budget reconciliation bill. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s senior U.S. senator has acknowledged that she disappointed key supporters when she cast a decisive vote a month ago in favor of the budget reconciliation measure known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
In an Anchorage news conference on Monday, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she had not been thinking about political popularity back home when she sided with fellow Republicans and helped pass the highly controversial bill championed by President Donald Trump.
 “When I vote on matters that are in front of me, whether it’s the reconciliation bill, the rescissions package, nominations, what I’m trying to do is not win elections. I am just trying to do the best that I can for Alaskans,” she said.
Despite her opposition to the bill’s cuts to the Medicaid program, Murkowski said she secured some wins for Alaska in the process, such as including increased funding for the U.S. Coast Guard and assistance for rural hospitals. It was a tough decision, she said.
“So I did everything within my power as one lawmaker from Alaska to ensure that the most vulnerable in our state would not be negatively impacted,” she said. “I had a hard choice to make, and I think I made the right choice for Alaskans.”
But many Alaska voters who have been her loyal supporters disagree, a new poll shows.
Murkowski – who holds the usual status as a national Republican who is much more supported by moderates and progressives than by members of her own party – suffered a big decline in popularity after she cast that vote, said Anchorage-based pollster Ivan Moore.
A survey conducted by his company, Alaska Survey Research, found that her status among self-described progressives in Alaska shifted from a net positive rating of 54 percentage points in January to a net negative of 21 percentage points at the end of July.
Moore said in an interview he had expected her popularity to slide after the vote but that he was stunned by the magnitude of the reversal.
“I had no idea that it was as significant as the numbers suggested,” he said. “I looked at this and my jaw just kind of hit the floor.”
Murkowski lost support of self-described moderates as well, slipping from a 57-29 positive-to-negative rating in January to a 49-47 positive-to-negative rating in July, polling results showed. And she gained no ground among conservatives; among that group, about eight in 10 respondents rated Murkowski negatively in July as well as in January.
Among all Alaskans surveyed, Murkowski’s 47-44 positive-to-negative rating in January had sagged by July to a 33% positive and 60% negative rating, according to the poll.
The senator’s position as a moderate, sometimes backing Trump and conservative causes and sometimes lining up with progressives, has been a difficult balancing act, Moore said.
“She’s straddling the fence, which has probably been very painful,” Moore said.
He said he believes she will not run again. For any candidate, “a 60 percent negative is a total nonstarter,” he said.
Asked about her own plans for reelection in 2028 at the end of her current term, Murkowski was noncommittal.
“2028 is still more than even just a couple years away. I am running every day to make sure that Alaskans needs are taken care of, and some days are harder than others,” she said at the news conference.
When asked about a possible run for governor, she teased a possible run for that office. However, she added that she was being “a little bit flippant” in her response to what she said was a frequent question posed to her.
“Would I love to come home?” she asked. “Of course, I would love to come home.”
For now, though, her responsibility is in the Senate, she said. “I am not ready to announce anything for anything, other than my plans for August.”
The comment somewhat echoed the title of her recently published memoir, “Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.”
There are already seven declared candidates for the 2026 gubernatorial race, all Republicans. Some other high-profile figures are potential candidates, including former U.S. Rep.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Democrat Stefano Famiglietti, a lawyer and North Providence Town Councilor, will represent Rhode Island Senate District 4 for the next 15 months after winning a special election Tuesday.
Famiglietti bested Republican candidate Alexander Asermely by a 66-percentage point margin, with 83% of votes as of 8:24 p.m, according to preliminary, unofficial results published by the Rhode Island Board of Elections. Republican Alexander Asermely received 16% of votes. Mail ballots returned Tuesday have not yet been counted. 
Famiglietti, 33, rang in his victory with family and friends at the Knights of Columbus hall on Douglas Avenue in North Providence. In a phone interview, the North Providence native attributed his win to his deep roots in the community and strong bench of support, including from the family of his predecessor, the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
“That’s always the key for every elected official,” Famiglietti said. “If you do the work and you are involved and you truly represent the community, that’s the results you get.”
Ruggerio held the seat for 40 years beginning in 1984 until his death on April 21, triggering a special election for the district spanning North Providence and part of Providence. Five candidates — four Democrats and one Republican — vied for the open spot, with Famiglietti sweeping the four-way Democratic primary in July.
Asermely, 39, also a lawyer and North Providence native, was the sole Republican and a first-time candidate. He did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment, though he posted photos throughout the day on his campaign Facebook page showing him with supporters at polling places. A
Asermely called Famiglietti to concede at 8:45 p.m., Famiglietti said in a text message.
The first step in his celebration? “Probably getting something to eat because I haven’t eaten a lot today,” he said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson, Majority Leader Frank Ciccone and Majority Whip David Tikoian issued a joint statement congratulating Famiglietti Tuesday night.
“His deep roots in the community and clear understanding of the priorities of District 4 have resonated with voters, and his commitment to public service is a strong reflection of the values exemplified by Senate President Dominick Ruggerio,” they said. As he prepares to take on this new role in the Rhode Island Senate, we look forward to working alongside him to strengthen our communities and ensure Rhode Island remains a great place to live and work.”
His election to the Senate now triggers a special election for his seat on the North Providence Council, which he has held since 2018. Dates for the Town Council special election have not been set.
Famiglietti will serve the remainder of Ruggerio’s term, though 2026, with a $20,391.97 annual salary for the part-time job. His priorities include increasing state aid to his district and other measures to offset tax burdens on district residents. 
He works as a personal injury lawyer with his own practice in Providence.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, along with a bipartisan coalition of 49 other attorneys general, requested that the U.S. Department of Justice assist in their efforts to address what they described as a “rampant spread of illegal offshore gaming operations” across the country.
In a letter addressed to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Brown and his counterparts said that illegal online sports betting and gaming operations, widely run by foreign-based companies, could be harming residents in all 50 states, since they “routinely operate without proper licensure, offer limited or non-existent consumer protections, fail to verify user age, ignore state boundaries, and evade taxation obligations.”
The volume of illegal online gaming has exceeded $400 billion a year, the attorneys estimate — and over $4 billion in lost tax revenue for states.

“Since 2013, USDOJ enforcement actions against illegal offshore gambling sites have been extremely limited,” the National Association of Attorneys General wrote. “We seek USDOJ’s cooperation and coordination to deploy robust legal tools to curb these unlawful enterprises.”
The Department of Justice is allowed to seize assets like servers, domains and proceeds that violate federal law, the letter says, an authority the department has used in at least two other fraud cases.
Additionally, the attorneys suggested the department work with major payment processors to cut off the companies’ access to the U.S. financial system. 
“Both Visa and Mastercard have already signaled their willingness to investigate and address unlawful use of their networks for gambling transactions,” the letter says. “We should capitalize on this willingness to shut down illegal offshore gaming operations.” 
The activity exposes vulnerable people to fraud and addictive gambling without oversight or accountability, the attorneys wrote, and has been linked to other serious crimes
“Illegal offshore gaming operations are a breeding ground for criminal behavior, such as money laundering and human trafficking. These companies routinely flaunt Utah laws and put Utah consumers at risk,” Brown said in a statement. “Together we can take action against these foreign-based operations that wreak havoc on our communities, foster gambling addictions, and harm Utah consumers.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)I was certain that the distance between each of the four-square poles was not the cause of my failed effort to string outdoor lights around the patio area last weekend.
Positively certain.
Again and again, as the weight of the light strings challenged the integrity of the perimeter at every turn, I would explain to my wife why she was wrong about her proposed solution. Moving the poles closer together will not fix anything, I said confidently, as if my long history as a DIY bumbler didn’t exist. To my brain, the physics of it were crystal clear and the only problem was the flimsiness of the poles that we paid too much for.
She was sure of her math, too, with the difference being that her calculations were correct.
I’m wrong a lot, about little things and big things, and the challenge amid all of that wrongness is to apply the lessons in a way that creates a little more balance between confidence and humility. The fulcrum is always solid and steady, something like wisdom, and that’s where I want to be.
So, in the end, I was happy to be wrong about the lights. But I remain a little miserable about the blind spots where I habitually find myself entrenched. Of the many curses on humanity, maybe that’s the worst one: We don’t know what we don’t know — and are too willing to defend that ignorance to the end.
And that’s exactly what makes public policy so tricky, too.
By way of example, this month the organization that administers New Hampshire’s universal school voucher program announced that a newly instituted 10,000-student enrollment limit had been reached, with an additional 295 families on a wait list. Because the “education freedom accounts” program had about half that number of students at the start of the last school year (when an income cap was still in place), it seems a pretty safe bet that a lot of the newcomers were previously blocked because their families made too much money to qualify.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who in June signed the bill that opened education freedom accounts to all regardless of income, previously appeared wary of universal vouchers for that very reason. In her inaugural address, she was careful to use the word “more” rather than “all” when referring to the expansion of EFAs, perhaps sensing where the universal path might lead. Maybe she should have listened to her gut. It seems like not-so-great fiscal management to give piles of taxpayer cash to well-to-do families who were going to send their kids to private school whether the state chipped in or not.
But here’s where I worry about blind spots.
I think voucher programs are here to stay. I think public school as I knew it as a kid is gone. And, I think that as a state and nation we’ve made a series of terrible mistakes in the way we’ve pursued “school choice.” But maybe I just don’t know what I don’t know.
What I do know, however, is that I’ve never considered publicly funded education to be a “monopoly,” as a political consultant named Brian Stephens called it in a New York Times story this week. I think public education as a concept is genius: A society realizes that its greatness will be determined not solely by military might but through the level of education attained by its citizens. From there, a perch above the wisdom fulcrum, a long line of prescient minds designs and implements an evolving system of public schooling for all children regardless of their personal backgrounds and circumstances. There is nothing smooth about large systems, and so progress toward that ideal was always going to be uneven and it was always going to be inequitable. But, until very recently, the American people had chosen repair and refinement over destruction. 
If that was the whole debate — whether vouchers will ultimately improve the system — it would be a lot like the patio light situation, although maybe not ever so cut-and-dried. We could have spirited conversations about what — and how fast — systemic changes could and should be introduced, and make sure that the “public good” remained, always, at the center. What makes me skeptical that vouchers were ever intended to be an educational improvement is the way public schools have been undermined and attacked in order to gain popular support for implementation of the voucher programs.
For starters, the genius of public education here in New Hampshire is significantly eroded by the way it’s funded. A graduated income tax that goes directly into an education fund to be equally distributed throughout the state (no more “rich town, poor town” dynamics) would be a lot more fair than our current overreliance on property taxes. It would also, not coincidentally, dampen a lot of the enthusiasm for vouchers among the state’s well-to-do. Instead of tackling the funding problem, however, public school critics pour all their energy into turning townspeople against their own community schools. The rising anger over school budgets correlates directly with the rising burden placed on property owners.
And that’s just the beginning.
It used to be that if a parent had a question about the appropriateness of a school lesson plan or library book, they would reach out to the teacher or principal and set up a meeting, and hopefully a civil one. Now, everything is first outlined as a broad left-wing conspiracy, with charges levied on social media or at board meetings where condemnation is preferred over resolution. A handful of the most righteous lawmakers, who certainly have more important things to worry about, encourage that narrative and push book bans, library privacy rollbacks, and any number of “parental rights” measures that promise far more darkness than sunshine. 
What I mean is, it feels to me like all of these full-throated, seemingly disconnected attacks on public schools — from curriculum pearl-clutching to outright public health disinformation — are part and parcel of the voucher push. The manufactured outrage is the lubricant for a privatization effort that in saner times would be quickly and popularly dismissed as the money grab that it is. And the Times story I mentioned above, the one where a political consultant says “the monopoly is over” — that helps place the concern in high relief.
“School systems in Orlando, Newark, Memphis, and dozens of other cities and towns,” writes journalist Dana Goldstein, “have hired consultants who aggressively woo parents to convince them to enroll their children in local public schools.
“Brian J. Stephens has built a business around this new reality,” the story continues. “Mr. Stephens, a political consultant based in Memphis, runs Caissa K12, a consulting firm for public school districts with the tag line ‘We recruit students.’ Caissa K12 has taken off, with over 100 district clients.”
For as many things as human society has gotten wrong, the basic structure of public education was something we got right. I just never realized how vulnerable our schools were to the undertow of American greed, where a public good is beneficial only so far as it has the potential to become big business.
Man, another blind spot.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lightsoutside-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-05 21:56:59.333824

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)WEST COLUMBIA — The state will take control of Jasper County School District following state Board of Education approval Tuesday, even as local board members asked the state to leave leadership intact.
State Superintendent Ellen Weaver told the local school board last week that she would seek control. Her letter cited years of financial turmoil as well as a report released last month that found potential fraud, conflicts of interest and mismanagement.
“Students, educators, and communities in every corner of South Carolina deserve accountable leadership and responsible stewardship,” Weaver said in a statement following the unanimous vote. “Today’s action, with the support of many local leaders, fulfills my sworn duty to act in the best interest of our students and taxpayers.”
It’s the first full takeover of her administration.
SC superintendent seeks full control of Jasper County schools as SLED investigates

It began immediately for the 2,600-student district, where classes started Monday. The board has 10 days to appeal the decision to the Administrative Law Court. But it’s unclear if board members will do so.
The decision disbanded the local school board. An appeal would not block that.
Weaver immediately appointed Laura Hickson, former superintendent of Florence District 3 (Lake City), as interim superintendent. Department officials, who have controlled the district’s finances since December, will be in charge of all decisions for the district.
The takeover is expected to last at least six years under a state law that took effect in July 2022.
The state Department of Education will set goals for the district to meet. Once it has done so for three years in a row, lawmakers will appoint a school board to make decisions for the following three years, until the agency determines the district is ready to take back local power.
The decision is not about providing help not punishment, said Rita Allison, chairwoman of the state Board of Education.
“It’s a helpful handout to help people get things back working so our children can be educated, our teachers can teach, and our people who are paying taxes for the educational system can have a good path forward,” said the former Spartanburg County legislator who chaired the House Education Committee.
This is the first time the state has taken over a school district since the 2022 law ensured the local board dissolved entirely and created the process for local control resuming. It was an effort by former Superintendent Molly Spearman to prevent handing back authority to the same people who let their districts get in such bad shape.
Two districts that Spearman took over — Allendale and Williamsburg counties, in 2017 and 2018, respectively — remain under state control.
Williamsburg County schools have been taking steps toward local control over the past year.
Any timeline remains uncertain in Allendale County, where the state’s first takeover in 1999 ended without much progress largely due to squabbles with fired school board members. It was such a quagmire, no state superintendent wanted to take on such a feat again until Spearman declared an emergency in the same district in 2017. And then she had to fight the local board, which sued.
Weaver’s emergency declaration for Jasper County marks only the fifth full district takeover since the Legislature authorized that power in 1998 — with Allendale being the first and second.
In July, the state board voted to take over Marlboro County School District’s finances, but not full management.
District response
Jasper County board member Tom Balliet called the board he’s elected to “the most dysfunctional I have ever experienced,” adding that he’s also worked at schools in Wisconsin.
“We’ve had that reputation for many, many years,” Balliet, secretary for the local board, said Tuesday.
Yet, Balliet asked the state board not to take over, saying change was in the works.
The board had a candidate in mind to hire as a new superintendent, and the next school board meeting was set to include changes to policy recommended in the inspector general’s report, he said.
If the state board couldn’t leave Jasper County to its own devices, Balliet suggested putting its decisions under strict scrutiny or disbanding part of the board but not all. Most of the board’s members, including himself and board chair Joyce Gerald, didn’t plan to run for reelection anyway, Balliet said. Gerald declined to comment.

“You lose the learning,” Balliet said. “There’s a tremendous learning curve. You lose the history. You lose some of the leadership that we have here.”
But that’s not an option under the takeover law that intentionally required total and immediate dissolvement of the local board. Spearman, who didn’t seek re-election in 2022, sought to get that into law before she left office.
Most of the issues raised with Jasper County schools have involved its former superintendent and the chief financial officer she hired, not the board itself, Balliet said. The inspector general’s report mainly focused on former Superintendent Rechel Anderson, but the report also said the board shirked its responsibility.
Board members knew Anderson had violated district policies and her own contract — and potentially state ethics laws — but did nothing to notify law enforcement of possible misconduct. They waited to do anything, then kept paying her even after voting to fire her, according to the report.
The board approved a settlement with Anderson in February, four months after firing her. It agreed to pay her $361,566 and declared her departure a resignation, effective in May.
Angela Bonaparte and Tedd Moyd, also members of the local school board, said they were doing the best they could for the children of their district and worried a takeover would create disruptions for students and parents.
“This is our opportunity to shine, and we don’t want anything, anyone, the state or anyone local, to stop our progress for these kids,” Moyd said.
State reasons
Those goals were not at odds with the state education department’s goals in taking over the district, said Ashley Storey, an attorney the department hired to review the takeover plans.
The department has already tried everything in its power to turn around the district’s financial situation. After taking control of the district’s purse strings in December, state officials are still working to get the district’s finances in enough order to complete a still-missing audit from two years ago, she said.

“There has just been no meaningful transformation by the district,” Storey said.
Declaring a state of emergency and taking over is “the final stop” when a district is having trouble, she said.
The district was first put under fiscal watch, the lowest of three escalating tiers for districts with financial difficulties, in 2023. Since then, the problems have only grown, Storey said.
The inspector general’s report proved the district was headed away from its goal, she said. Any one issue raised in the report, or the district’s financial troubles, might not raise it to the level of a full takeover. But taken together, the department had no option but to act, she said.
“At this time, it’s got to be done for these children,” Storey said.
Local support for a takeover
The Jasper County Council, Hardeeville City Council and Ridgeland Town Council supported the state’s takeover of the district.
As it is, “the district poses a significant and immediate threat to the educational outcomes and overall well-being of the students it serves,” representatives of the councils wrote in a July letter to Allison.
“Despite the dedication of many local educators and administrators, longstanding challenges in academic performance, lack of governance and accountability from the Jasper County School Board, and numerous operational deficiencies have created conditions that warrant urgent and decisive action,” the letter reads.
Sen. Tom Davis, a Republican who lives in Beaufort but represents part of Jasper County, said he also supported a takeover.
“The irregularities noted in the report are serious, and the state Department of Education should take full control of the county school district’s operations until proper accounting systems and checks and balances are put in place,” Davis said in a text message.
Inspector general’s report

Anderson and the district are under investigation by the State Law Enforcement Division, a spokeswoman confirmed.
Anderson was not at the meeting Tuesday. She has not responded to multiple requests for comment.
Anderson lived and operated businesses more than 150 miles from the district office, in violation of her contract, the inspector general found. When asked to prove her address, Anderson produced a lease that appeared to be fake, according to the report.
One of her other business ventures involved working for Cognia, the accreditation group for Jasper County School District, which the report raised as a potential conflict of interest.
The state Department of Education is investigating whether Anderson’s job with Cognia had any effect on the district’s accreditation status.
Anderson failed to report the approximately $48,000 she received from the agency over seven years on her state-required financial statements. Instead, she incorrectly listed her superintendent salary at $60,000 more than the district was actually paying her.
Anderson was rarely in her office or at the district’s schools during her time as superintendent, employees told the inspector general. When she was at work, she used district time and resources to work on her book, “Professional Walk: An Educator’s Perspective.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4228-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 21:56:59.333824

Frank)A federal judge in Missoula on Tuesday vacated the federal government’s determination that gray wolves in the Western United States do not need increased federal protections under the Endangered Species Act. 
Several coalitions of conservation groups, including several from Montana, filed lawsuits in federal district court last year against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in an attempt to force the agency to reapply ESA protections to the species. 
The groups praised the decision from the federal district court in Montana as a step forward towards providing greater protection for the iconic species. 
“The Endangered Species Act requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service consider the best available science, and that requirement is what won the day for wolves in this case,” Matthew Bishop, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, which represented some of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “Wolves have yet to recover across the West, and allowing a few states to undertake aggressive wolf-killing regimes is inconsistent with the law. We hope this decision will encourage the Service to undertake a holistic approach to wolf recovery in the West.”
In 2021, more than 70 organizations, led by the Western Watersheds Project, submitted a petition asking FWS to relist gray wolves as a threatened species in the Northern Rockies where they are managed by state governments, or to create a larger Western Distinct Population Segment for the species with added protections. 
But in a February 2024 determination, the agency declined to make any changes to gray wolves’ protected status, but said it would develop a National Recovery Plan for wolves in the lower 48 states.
“We concluded that the gray wolf in the Western United States is not in danger of extinction, or likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future, throughout all of its range or in any significant portion of its range,” the federal finding stated. “Therefore, we find that listing the gray wolf in the Western United States as an endangered species or a threatened species under the Act is not warranted.”
In the subsequent lawsuits, combined into a single suit before U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy, the conservation groups argued that FWS erred in its decision by failing to consider the “best available science” on wolf populations and the impacts of hunting and trapping; the full extent of the species’ historical range; and the threat posed by inadequate state and federal regulations that often bow to political headwinds. 
In his Aug. 5 ruling, Molloy wrote that “for the most part, plaintiffs are correct.” His ruling vacated most of the FWS finding, and sent the decision back to the agency for further consideration. 
The agency “made numerous unfounded assumptions regarding the future condition of the gray wolf despite recognizing either limitation on those conditions or bias in the population estimates utilized,” Molloy wrote. “Because these deficiencies are serious and pervasive, they weigh in favor of vacating the portion of the 2024 Finding that determined that the gray wolf in the Western United States does not meet the definition of an endangered or threatened species.”
Officials in Montana — which joined the lawsuit with the federal government —  decried the ruling as yet another ruling by an “activist” judge.
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists. If the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks will be there to support them.”

  Bad science 

Gray wolves were almost entirely eliminated from the lower-48 states by the 1970s, leading to their listing under the Endangered Species Act. 
In 2009, the species was delisted, leading to litigation, and in 2011 Congressional action officially turned management of the species over to the states of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and the eastern thirds of Oregon and Washington. 
Currently, gray wolves are listed as a threatened species in Minnesota and endangered in the remaining 44 states. 
According to a 2022 report by FWS, which formed the basis for its later determination, there were approximately 2,797 wolves in the western U.S. — including roughly 1,000 wolves in both Montana and Idaho, fewer than 400 in Wyoming, and around 200 in Oregon and Washington. The federal agency estimated an additional 20 wolves are estimated in California and Utah and two in Colorado. 
In 2023, Colorado began relocating wolves to the state, with four established packs reported as of this month. 
In the lawsuit, the conservation groups claimed FWS was not using adequate scientific research in estimating population data, and cast doubts on the methods utilized by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and Idaho’s wildlife agency. 
Montana uses an integrated patch occupancy model, or iPOM, to estimate wolf populations using hunter surveys and three different models which estimate wolf distribution, wolf pack mean territory, and average pack size. 
iPOM has been criticized by researchers in the past for not using direct data or population counts, and thus, overestimating the state’s population of wolves. 
Idaho Fish and Game, meanwhile, uses a model that utilizes trail cameras to estimate population density, which has also been criticized for overcounting the species. 
Molloy wrote in his order that FWS is required to “meaningfully account for uncertainty and address substantive criticism,” in data used for Endangered Species assessments, and that the “failure to do so was arbitrary and capricious.”
“Ultimately, the Service failed to use the best available science in violation of the ESA when it relied on Montana’s and Idaho’s population estimates without addressing the criticisms,” Molloy wrote.

  State mandated reduction 

Montana’s Legislature has long sought to reduce the state’s wolf population closer to a “sustainable level” mentioned in the federal government’s delisting rule — roughly 450 wolves. 
The state’s population of roughly 1,100 wolves has remained steady for the last several years, despite decreased limitations on hunting and trapping in Montana. 
In 2025, the legislature considered several laws to dramatically curtail the wolf population, including enacting an unlimited quota until roughly half the state’s wolves were eradicated, but only one major bill became law. 
House Bill 259, brought by Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompson Falls, requires the Fish and Wildlife Commission to apply different management techniques based on the population conditions in each region — with additional emphasis put on those with the highest populations. The bill also clarified that on private lands, hunters may use infrared and thermal imagery scopes outside of daylight hours.
Those changes to state law are reflected in a recently released proposal from Montana FWP outlining changes to the upcoming hunting and trapping season. 
Under the proposal, FWP’s new regulations would create a statewide hunting and trapping quota, rather than stricter regional quotas. Up to 500 wolves could be killed during the next season, up from a quota of 334 during the 2023-2024 season. 
During the 2024-25 wolf season, which ended on March 15, the take totaled 297 wolves, including 178 by hunters and 119 by trappers. The number was the highest since 2020, when 326 wolves were killed.
Changes in state management were cited as another reason for FWS to reconsider putting wolves under federal protections, according to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
FWS failed to consider “politically motivated, legislative interference with agency discretion and management authority,” according to the plaintiffs, which creates a “manmade factor affecting [the gray wolf’s] continued existence.”
Molloy wrote that negative public attitudes are “undisputedly expressed in the legislative bodies governing Montana and Idaho,” and said FWS did not consider how those attitudes would impact state commitments to maintaining minimum populations of wolves needed to prevent relisting. 
“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote. 
According to court filings by the state of Montana and FWP, the Legislature’s “liberalized methods of take with an overall intent to reduce the wolf population,” did not remove the ability of the wildlife agency to set its own rules based on scientific data. 
The state and FWP also highlighted the fact that the Montana Wish and Wildlife Commission has maintained bag limits and required a single license per wolf for hunters and trappers. However, the new 2025 proposal from FWP significantly increases bag limits, allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single license.
In the 2024 decision not to apply endangered species status to wolves, FWS acknowledged that high harvest rates in Idaho and Montana could reduce state populations by 80% to 90%, resulting in “fewer than 100 wolves in each state.”
Ultimately, Molloy agreed with the plaintiff’s arguments that FWS did not adequately consider the future of the gray wolf under the most drastic human-caused mortality scenarios, nor the political climate that could add pressure to states to continually increase hunting and trapping opportunities.Those changes could lead to the species requiring federal protections again, Molloy wrote. 
“Wildlife management agencies are likely to find themselves in a Catch-22 as they cannot escape from mutually conflicting dependent conditions: If the federal agency succeeds in restoring the gray wolf, leading to delisting, then the state agencies will depredate the wolf, leading to relisting, engendering a fruitless cycle of delisting and relisting,” Molloy wrote.
He also agreed that FWS did not consider the extent of the wolf’s historic range — which includes a majority of the western states — in considering whether it met the ESA definition of endangered or threatened in “a significant portion of its range.”
The ruling sent the decision on the petition to relist gray wolves back to the agency. 
Questions directed to officials at FWS about a timeline for reconsidering the petition, or a possible appeal of Molloy’s ruling, were not answered by publication time. 
The conservation organizations that sued the federal government included the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, Western Watersheds Project, WildEarth Guardians, International Wildlife Coexistence Network, Predator Defense, Protect the Wolves, Trap Free Montana, Wilderness Watch, Alliance for the Wild Rockies and others. 
“Wolf recovery is dependent on responsible management by the states, and Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have shown that they’re grossly unsuited to manage the species,” Nick Gevock, Sierra Club northern Rockies campaign strategist, said in a press release. “Judge Molloy’s ruling means now the Fish and Wildlife Service must go back to the drawing board to determine whether federal management is needed to ensure wolves survive and play their vital role in the ecosystem.”

Shell’s plant in Beaver County that produces plastics from Marcellus Shale gas has been hit with six air pollution violations so far this year and a watchdog group warns that nearby communities aren’t getting timely notification of the events.
The first of its kind in Pennsylvania, the Shell Polymers plant in Potter Township uses ethane, derived from natural gas, to produce polyethylene, a commonly used type of plastic. Since it started operations in 2022, the plant has been the subject of criticism from neighbors worried about air and water pollution and what they say is a lack of transparency. 
The facility, known as an ethane cracker, has amassed nearly 50 notices of violations and the six “high-priority violations” so far this year have outpaced five violations noted by state and federal regulators in all of 2024, the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC) said in a statement Tuesday. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The group, which promotes awareness of health, safety and environmental impacts of gas fracking infrastructure, said the violations reveal an “ongoing pattern of environmental noncompliance,” by Shell.
It also notes the company has not been issued a formal monetary penalty since May 2023, when it was fined nearly $5 million after acknowledging it had frequently exceeded emissions limitations at its plant since October 2022. The settlement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection also required Shell to pay $5 million for projects “to benefit the environment, health and quality of life of the community near the facility.”
BCMAC’s statement says the DEP has failed to post notices of the violations on its webpage for the Shell plant in a timely manner.
“Shell violated air pollution laws in a way that the federal government itself considers a ‘high priority’ but no one prioritized informing our communities,” BCMAC Executive Director Hilary Starcher-O’Toole said. “Real people live near this plant. Families. Children. People deserve transparency from the billion-dollar corporation polluting their air and from the regulators whose job it is to protect us.” 
Starcher-O’Toole said Shell and the DEP must provide real-time notifications when malfunctions and violations occur. “Anything less is negligence,” she added.
Shell did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In an Inside Climate News article this May about bright light from gas flares at the plant disturbing neighbors, a Shell spokesperson said the company notifies the community of events at the plant through “social media, community events and public notifications.”
Hilary Flint, director communications and community engagement for BCMAC, said public notices are required for pollution events that affect drinking water, but whether there is a requirement for air pollution notifications is unclear.
“We have been advocating for timely public disclosure of any pollution events or violations associated with the Shell facility for years, and over 65,000 people have signed our petition supporting that request,” Flint said.

DEP regional communications manager Laina Aquiline said the agency posts documents related to certain facilities, including the Shell Polymers plant, on its community page as a courtesy to the public.

The U.S. Department of Energy pulled a federal loan guarantee that was in place for the 800-mile transmission line. (Invenergy)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Energy yanked a $5 billion loan from the company building the Grain Belt Express, saying the project is “unlikely” to meet conditions required for the loan guarantee. 
A Kansas activist said the setback is a direct shot at green energy. 
“The Grain Belt Express was originally designed for wind and solar,” said Dorothy Barnett, executive director of Climate + Energy Project. “I don’t know how pulling the loan guarantee can be seen as anything but an attempt to stop wind and solar. I’m hopeful Invenergy will be able to move ahead despite this setback.”
The Grain Belt Express, an 800-mile, 5,000-megawatt transmission line that will cross Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, has received approval for construction from each state’s energy regulators. In Kansas, that process began 14 years ago in front of the Kansas Corporation Commission.
Chicago-based Invenergy, the country’s largest privately owned green energy company, is building the project. A company spokesperson said the project is open to private financing after losing the federal loan. 
The company was disappointed in the Department of Energy decision but the representative said that a “privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance.”
The company did not respond to a question about whether private financing has already been secured or is in the process of being raised. 
The Grain Belt Express has been billed as a way to move wind energy, specifically from Kansas wind farms, to Indiana and Illinois. Although the line can carry energy from all sources, it was designed to reach areas where transmission infrastructure is sparse so that power generating stations could easily connect and transport energy. In Kansas, that would facilitate moving energy from wind farms, KCC testimony indicated. 
The Grain Belt Express has faced multiple challenges since it first went before Kansas regulators for approval, including removal from a federal program in December 2024 billed as supporting power transmission in areas with little infrastructure. It also faces criticism over landowner’s rights, as Invenergy has worked for the past decade to purchase property for the lines.  
Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley was pivotal in ending the loan guarantee, pressuring President Donald Trump and the Department of Energy. 
Hawley accused the Biden administration of rushing through loan approvals without proper vetting of projects and castigated Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a letter June 25 for not cancelling the Grain Belt Express loan. 
Grain Belt Express said Hawley’s attempts to cancel the loan were “bizarre” in a post on X. Hawley had posted on the social media site that he spoke with Trump about stopping the “Green Belt Express scam.” 
“This is bizarre,” the company wrote July 10. “Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history, which is already approved by all four states and is aligned with the President’s energy dominance agenda. Senator Hawley is trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability and national security, all in an era of exponentially growing electricity demand.”

Gavin Newsom has moved to close five state prisons because of California's falling incarcerated population. The next one in line is in Riverside County.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom has moved to close five state prisons because of California’s falling incarcerated population. The next one in line is in Riverside County. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom shouldn’t expect much pushback from the next city in line to lose a state prison. 
Norco in Riverside County for years has been lobbying to close the California Rehabilitation Center, arguing the city can find a better use for the site. It was an art deco hotel before it was a state prison.
Now, the prison is on track to close in 2026. Newsom’s corrections department said on Tuesday that the prison is no longer needed because of the state’s falling incarcerated population. 
It’ll be the fifth to close during Newsom’s administration. The state expects to save about $150 million by closing the prison.
Other prison cities fought the closures by suing the state or lobbying to hold on to the jobs.
Not Norco. It posted a statement on social media saying officials look forward to the “adaptive reuse” of the former hotel.
“The Norco City Council remains hopeful that one day, this historic gem will be restored to its former glory as a resort and will become a regional economic driver,” the city statement read.
About 1,200 people work at the prison. They won’t necessarily be laid off when the prison closes because some will be able to transfer to other sites.
Newsom signaled his intent to close another prison when he released his budget proposal in May and grappled with a $12 billion deficit.
The corrections department “is committed to managing its resources responsibly to enhance public safety and best serve the people of California. California’s 2025-26 budget called for a prison closure, one of many challenging actions required to address the state’s fiscal position.” Newsom’s corrections department said in a written statement about closing the Norco prison. 
In the past, the union representing California correctional officers has not spoken out against Newsom closing prisons. Instead, it worked to improve pay and working conditions for its members as the prison population plummeted from a peak of about 170,000 to today’s 91,000 people.
That changed this week when its president issued a statement criticizing the closure of the Norco site.
“Shuttering (the prison in Norco) eliminates essential physical space that relieves overcrowding, supports rehabilitative programming, and maintains a workable ratio between staff and incarcerated individuals,” Neil Flood, president of the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, said in a written statement. “This balance is critical to safety for all Californians: reducing capacity while raising population density leads to more violence overall, both within institutions and beyond their walls.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/080912-CRC-Norco-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-05 19:56:52.334375

Screenshot via North Country Supervisory Union
The night before the state’s school redistricting task force met for the first time, more than two dozen school officials from the Northeast Kingdom met to discuss the possible effects of the task force’s work, and how they could advocate for themselves.
The mood was stark at the Thursday night meeting, with many officials expressing resentment for attempts to further consolidate Vermont’s school districts. But the ad hoc group of board members and school officials from the North Country, Essex North and Orleans Central supervisory unions planned to develop a shared plan to try and lobby the task force.
“We do believe that given what’s coming, we may have a chance to influence where things are going,” Praneet Menon, the chair of the North Country Supervisory Union, said during the meeting.
On Friday, the 11-member School Redistricting Task Force had its inaugural meeting, which was mostly procedural. Created under Act 73 to craft new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system, the task force, made up of legislators, former superintendents and school officials, went over logistics and laid out what they hoped to accomplish.

“This is our moment to create significant change that will benefit our children,” Dave Wolk, a former state senator and former president of Castleton University who was appointed to the task force by Gov. Phil Scott, said at the Friday morning meeting.
As the work to overhaul Vermont’s public education system begins in earnest, supervisory unions and school districts are bracing for impact. Some, like the three Northeast Kingdom supervisory unions, are coordinating how to influence that process.
Part of Act 73, Vermont’s sweeping education law passed during this year’s Legislative session, the new task force will work to consolidate Vermont’s 118 school districts — contained within the 51 supervisory districts or supervisory unions — into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
These new larger districts would oversee a minimum of 4,000 prekindergarten through grade 12 students, but no more than 8,000 students “to the extent practical,” according to the law.
The law’s new mandates around class size minimums and consolidations has created anxiety for school districts and their local communities. Rural communities fear the law’s implementation will eventually force the closure of their schools.
“What you’re working on right now has the potential to have a massive impact on the quality of life for young families and children in our state,” Cheryl Charles, the chair of the Windham Northeast Supervisory Union board and the chair of the Rural Schools Community Alliance, said during the Friday task force meeting.
In the Northeast Kingdom, “there’s a lot of concern among our constituents that what they’re suggesting at the state level will not work for us given the rurality of our area,” Menon, who organized the ad hoc committee, said in an interview this week.
The goal, Menon said, is to formulate a unified plan to present to the task force. That could mean devising an in-house consolidation plan among the three supervisory unions to present to the task force. Or to tell the task force they reject the premise of their work altogether.
“Either way we go, I think it is somewhat of a push back, because in one way, we’re saying, ‘Here’s what we want,’ and the other way we’re saying, ‘We don’t want anything that you’re suggesting whatsoever,'” he said. “What we want to do out of this is influence the task force’s end result so that we can carve out something that is favorable to our constituents, our students, and the regional needs of our area.”
“The mentality is, this is coming, and if it is coming, then we might as well try and figure out how we can influence the process,” Menon added.
Tight timeline
The task force is taking on a significant task on an ambitious timeline — about five months to draw up no more than three new possible configurations to the Legislature by Dec. 1.
“We will do the best we can with the time that we have,” Rep. Edye Graning, D-Chittenden-3, said during the task force meeting. Graning, who together with Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, was named a co-chair of the task force.
The Legislature plans to take up the task force’s recommendations during the next legislative session, but they are not bound to accept their recommendations.
Much of Act 73’s sweeping provisions hinges on the Legislature eventually agreeing to a new map next session during an election year. In the Northeast Kingdom, some officials on the ad hoc committee questioned whether the process will move forward at all.
“There’s a strong possibility that the whole thing just goes away,” said John Castle, a board member with the North Country Supervisory Union and the executive director of the Vermont Rural Education Collaborative.
“Now, I can’t guarantee you that. I don’t know that,” he said during the meeting, “but there’s a part of me that feels like we should be the biggest pain we possibly can be, and join others in the state to be a real pain, to see the whole thing go away.”
There was plenty of skepticism during the task force’s meeting as well. The consolidation proposed under Act 73 would mark the “biggest governance reform in 100-and-something years,” Rebecca Holcombe, D-Windsor Orange-2, said during the meeting.
She was skeptical of the state’s ability to see such a process through.
“It’s pretty clear we are not capable of doing what we already have on our plate,” she said.
Others on the task force expressed optimism that the work over the next five months could help transform Vermont’s struggling public education system.
Jay Badams, recently retired as superintendent of School Administrative Unit 70, said he led his former district through a consolidation effort that “ultimately ended up closing five schools, eliminating 300 teaching positions and cutting central office in half.”
“We saved money by consolidating. We saved significant sums of money,” he said during the task force meeting. “And for us to get better outcomes, to bring equity where I would argue there isn’t right now, or even substantially equal resources for all of our kids, is going to require some hard choices.”
He said the task force should involve the public in the work and be transparent. He also said the task force members will have to “acknowledge that if we’re going to be successful in this work, there will be sacrifices that we’ll be asking some entities to make.”
“I think you as legislators will have tons of pressure from people who will oppose a lot of those ideas,” he said. “But it can be done.”

Tyrone Broomfield (center) looks through paperwork during a July 26, 2024 Board of Corrections meeting in North Little Rock. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate) The Arkansas Board of Corrections voted Friday to participate in a recidivism reduction pilot program proposed by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
The pilot will feature a whole-of-government approach to preventing reincarceration, according to Cortney Kennedy, Sanders’ chief legal counsel. Kennedy presented the proposal at the board’s meeting last week. The board voted to begin searching for a place to host the pilot program and to begin working out logistics.
The program will initially include 100 inmates, targeting those who are at least six months from release.
Kennedy told the board the program would draw in government agencies such as the Department of Commerce, the Division of Workforce Services, the private sector and faith communities and organizations to help inmates reintegrate into society upon their release.
The goal, according to Kennedy, is to help inmates find housing and work.
According to a news release sent by the governor’s office Tuesday, Sanders said the state “isn’t doing enough” to prepare incarcerated people to reenter society, despite rehabilitation being “a major goal” of imprisonment.
“This pilot program will address many of the issues that cause former inmates to recommit, like lack of housing, employment, and substance abuse treatment,” Sanders said in the release. “Ultimately, we want to expand this program statewide to lower Arkansas’ recidivism rate and prepare inmates for a healthy, well-adjusted life outside prison.”
Arkansas’ repeat-offender rate stood at 44% in 2018, one of the highest published recidivism rates in the country, according to a 2024 recidivism reduction report from The Council of State Governments Justice Center, a nonpartisan nonprofit that represents local and state governments.
What is the Protect Arkansas Act?

The pilot program proposes to modify the terms of supervision for program participants to allow felons to “live, work, and ride in transportation together” if they are working with “established employment partners.”
A proposed case manager position would “manage inmate needs on an individual level and facilitate their introductions to Parole Officers,” while state officials would be brought “on-site” to provide program participants with birth certificates, drivers licenses and social security cards, the release said.
Programming would address substance abuse, mental illness and “other issues” while connecting participants with support groups and doctors, the release said. State agencies, private businesses and nonprofits would be tapped to “create on-site training and industry opportunities, allowing inmates to develop skills while still incarcerated, earn a quality income, and prepare for employment upon release.”
Being tough on crime has been a focus for conservative politicians, statewide and nationally. That includes Arkansas. Lawmakers passed the Arkansas Protect Act in 2023, and Sanders and some other GOP lawmakers are pushing for a new 3,000-bed prison that a member of the corrections board has said isn’t needed.

In Arkansas’ most recent legislative session, legislators of both parties still voted overwhelmingly for at least two laws that aim to reduce the state’s recidivism rate.
Arkansas’ recidivism rate has remained flat — in 2008, it stood at 45%. The Justice Center’s report notes that states use different methods for determining recidivism. Data used for some states in the report is nearly 10 years old.
Comparatively, California — a state routinely lambasted by Sanders for not being tough enough on crime — has reduced its recidivism rate from 64% to 20% over the same period.
As of 2023, the most recent year with data available, Arkansas has the fourth highest number of violent crimes per 100,000 people in the country, according to USAFacts. California ranks sixth, with 620 violent crimes per 100,000 people.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-05 23:07:16+00:00,CT Mirror,"State, but no CT cities, on DOJ list of ‘sanctuary jurisdictions’",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/05/ct-sanctuary-cities/,Six CT cities were on a list of 'sanctuary cities' published and withdrawn in May by Homeland Security. They are not on the new list.,"The six Connecticut municipalities briefly labeled as sanctuary cities by the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security in May are absent from a revised list posted without explanation Tuesday by the Department of Justice.
But Connecticut, whose Trust Act limits cooperation with federal authorities in identifying and detaining undocumented immigrants, was one of 12 states deemed to have “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”
The mayors of New Haven and Hartford, the two largest Connecticut cities on the previous list, said the administration offered no notice or rationale for the inclusion in May, nor did it explain why they were stricken Tuesday.
“Who the heck knows? Trying to figure out any sort of method to the Trump administration’s madness is a fool’s errand,” said Mayor Justin Elicker of New Haven. “They seem to change their minds every few hours.”
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam was equally adrift.
“You guess is as good as mine,” said Arulampalam, who emigrated to the U.S. as a child. “We got the list, and that’s about it. The best I can tell is a bunch of 20-something tech bros are doing policy.”
East Haven, Hamden, New London and Windham were the other four places deemed to be sanctuary cities on a list that appeared on the Homeland Security web site on a Friday in May and was gone by the following Monday. 
There was no mention of the old list in the statement posted Tuesday by Attorney General Pamela Bondi. 
“Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” Bondi said. “The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”
Natalie Baldassarre, the senior media affairs manager for DOJ, offered no specific reason for why the six Connecticut cities were on the first list and not the second but pointed to a general statement about the process:
“These designations were made after a thorough review of documented laws, ordinances, and executive directives by the listed jurisdictions. This initial list of designated Sanctuary Jurisdictions will be reviewed regularly, to include additional jurisdictions and remove jurisdictions that have remediated their policies, practices, and laws. Each state, county, and city will have an opportunity to respond to its placement on the list.”
An updated version of the DOJ announcement added nine criteria for sanctuary jurisdictions absent from the original post Tuesday. Among them were restrictions on information sharing with ICE and refusing to honor detainer requests made by ICE without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut’s Trust Act, which was passed in 2013 and revised in 2019 and this year, limits the circumstances in which police and others can alert federal agents to the location of an undocumented immigrant or detain them for deportation, with exceptions for individuals facing serious criminal charges.
The original Trust Act was passed unanimously during the administration of Barack Obama, but the two revisions during Trump’s first and second terms came on largely party-line votes in a General Assembly dominated by Democrats.
State officials say the law is consistent with the anti-commandeering clause of the Constitution, which bars the federal government from forcing local and state authorities to act as agents of the federal government.
Democrats say the intent of all three laws was to ensure undocumented immigrants will feel safe reporting a crime or seeking aid from police without fear of being turned over to ICE. Republicans say they are too restrictive.
In February, New Haven joined San Francisco and other cities and counties to file a lawsuit enjoining the Trump administration from withholding federal funds over their immigration policies.
“They have not attempted to cut funding to us,” Elicker said.
New York, Rhode Island and Vermont were among the northeastern states deemed sanctuary states. Massachusetts and New Jersey were not, though Bondi listed Boston and four New Jersey cities: Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark and Paterson.
The other states labeled as impeding immigration enforcement are California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Protest in New Britain
Meanwhile, protesters gathered in front of city hall on Tuesday in downtown New Britain to protest ICE. They said that five people at a local car wash were picked up by ICE the day before.
Chanting “Say it loud, say it clear: immigrants are welcome here,” protesters held signs like ICE OUT OF CT and DEPORT ICE.
Ebaa Mohamed, the executive director of the Muslim Center for Justice led the protest, criticizing New Britain’s mayor Erin Stewart as silent in the face of ICE activity in the city.
“She has put out zero statements,” Mohamed said. Stewart has been exploring a run for governor.
Omer Abdelgader, a Sudan native, also spoke at the protest. He said that ICE is coming to New Britain because of its large immigrant population from countries like Yemen and Mexico, people who are “working hard. And they’re just wanting to scare us,” he said. “Have you ever seen a criminal at a car wash?”
The protesters closely linked the issues of immigration enforcement and the U.S. role in Gaza. Many wore keffiyeh scarves to show solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where the United Nations says there is evidence of famine.
“They want everyone to look away from what’s happening in Gaza,” said Abdelgader. “I don’t want to make this about Gaza, but to be honest with you, that’s what they’re trying to do with us. They’re trying to tell us, ICE is coming for you. You better hide.” 
Deicin García tearfully spoke to the crowd through an interpreter about the people in New Britain who had been picked up by ICE the day before. 
“To those who try to divide us by kidnapping immigrants, if you detain one of us, you don’t just take one person. You tear apart a family, you leave children crying for their parents, you create fear in classrooms, silence in playgrounds and trauma in hearts that may never fully heal. This is not justice, this is cruelty.” 
García said their movement would never stop fighting for dignity.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1118_SR_ImmigrationRally_159-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 19:56:52.334375

Vermont is not officially a sanctuary state, but it again found itself in the U.S. Justice Department’s latest list of 35 sanctuary jurisdictions as part of the federal government’s continued effort to target communities that are seen as interfering with immigration enforcement.
“Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” Attorney General Pamela Bond said in a Tuesday Justice Department press release, calling sanctuary policies “harmful” and threatening to sue those who refuse to comply with federal law.
The Justice Department first released a longer list in May in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide that are “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.”
The list, which earlier this year named more than 500 jurisdictions across red and blue states, met strong pushback. The new list of about three dozen sanctuary jurisdictions, largely Democratic, makes no reference to the older list which has been removed from the Department of Homeland Security’s website.

The sanctuary movement began in 1982 with some American churches declaring that they would provide refuge to Central Americans after civil conflicts erupted in Guatemala and El Salvador. San Francisco was the first city to enact a sanctuary policy in the U.S. in 1989. The term has since been used to describe communities that limit local cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
In 2017, Gov. Phil Scott signed legislation and published guidelines for municipalities to consider when adopting policies on municipal law enforcement interactions with federal immigration officials. But in taking these actions, the governor stopped short of officially declaring the state a sanctuary jurisdiction.
A fact sheet put out by Scott at the time stated, “Vermont’s response does not put federal dollars at risk because it does not establish Vermont as a ‘sanctuary jurisdiction.’”
In May, when Vermont first appeared on the Justice Department’s list of sanctuary jurisdictions, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Gov. Phil Scott, insisted that the state has not established itself as a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” 
“Vermont maintains full compliance with federal law while protecting the Constitutional rights of citizens and the State. This means, Vermont doesn’t stand in the way of the federal government carrying out federal immigration laws in Vermont,” Wheeler said at the time.
Wheeler could not be reached immediately for comment on Tuesday.
Advocates were quick to defend sanctuary policies and Vermont’s stance this week. Federal immigration authorities have in recent months targeted an Upper Valley resident with legal residency status, a Middlebury student on a valid visa, and a U.S. citizen and Winooski school superintendent. 
Policies that protect residents and help foster trust between them and law enforcement are important, said Lia Ernst, legal director at the ACLU of Vermont.
“Cities and states have every right to focus on serving their own residents — not enabling Trump’s mass deportation agenda — and that’s exactly what Vermont’s leaders should continue to do,” Ernst said in an email to VTDigger on Tuesday.
The Trump administration recently sued New York City for having a sanctuary city policy claiming that it led to the non-fatal shooting of a Customs and Border Protection officer in a Manhattan park, the Associated Press reported.
This week’s list, which the department plans to update, names four counties, 13 states and 18 cities from Boston to Seattle, according to the Justice Department release.
The Justice Department has filed several lawsuits to “compel compliance with federal law,” according to the press release, which encourages communities to revoke sanctuary policies as a Kentucky city did recently.
Last month, Democratic Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg reversed course to say the city would comply with the Trump administration’s 48-hour immigration detainer requests and in exchange, the federal government planned to drop the city from its list, The Hill reported.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Ecology)Two oil refinery operators in northwest Washington, HF Sinclair and Tesoro, have been hit with fines for improper management of oily sludge and acid waste at their facilities.
Washington’s Department of Ecology said Tuesday that HF Sinclair would be penalized $1,303,000 and Tesoro $1,397,000 for violations of dangerous waste laws. Both companies run refineries located in Anacortes.
Each of them has 30 days to pay the penalties or appeal to the state Pollution Control Hearings Board. 
The penalty against HF Sinclair stems from a September 2023 incident where oily process wastewater overflowed into a spill containment area at the company’s refinery. 
The containment area is intended to capture spills of non-hazardous wastewater and was not designed to be a dangerous waste storage area, according to the Department of Ecology. 
Hazardous sludge settled out of the untreated wastewater and remained for 11 months before HF Sinclair removed and disposed of it in nine 20-yard containers. 
After removing the sludge, the single liner for the containment area was found to be ripped. 
“The lengthy delay in cleaning up the spill unacceptably increased risks that the material could have escaped into the environment,” the Department of Ecology said in a news release.
An HF Sinclair spokesperson acknowledged receipt of the penalty notice in an email on Tuesday and affirmed the company’s commitment to operating safely and responsibly. 
“While we disagree with the assertions, we look forward to working with the Department of Ecology to address its concerns,” said Corinn Smith, senior director of corporate communications for HF Sinclair. “Our number one priority remains the safety of our employees and the communities where we operate.” 
The Tesoro penalty is related to the company’s management of a 150,000-gallon pond that held spent sulfuric acid from industrial processes at its Marathon Anacortes refinery. 
The wastewater in that pond was frequently about the same pH as battery acid, qualifying it as a dangerous waste, according to the Department of Ecology.  
Inspectors flagged the problem in 2022, noting that the acidity of the pond needed to be controlled to prevent damage to the pond’s liner and a potential toxic release.
The Department of Ecology later began mandating regular testing of the pond, which revealed that dangerous acidity was an ongoing problem. 
It took Tesoro nine months to implement an alternative management method for the waste, according to the Department of Ecology. 
Tesoro is currently working with the Department of Ecology to remove the remaining residue in the pond.
A spokesperson for Tesoro did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday afternoon. 
The Department of Ecology is still investigating whether there was environmental damage from the mishandling of the dangerous wastes.
“HF Sinclair and Tesoro are two of the largest industrial facilities in the state, and safely handling millions of gallons of hazardous materials every day is their core business,” said Tom Buroker, director of Ecology’s northwest region. “They have the expertise, the resources, and the responsibility to extend that level of attention to their waste.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/acid-pond-marathon-refinery.jpg,,,2025-08-05 19:56:52.334375
,California,2025-08-05 23:01:48+00:00,CalMatters,‘Immediately rescind’: UC researchers ask judge to undo Trump’s UCLA grant suspensions,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/08/research-grants-california/,UC researchers claim a judge’s previous order barred the National Science Foundation from suspending UCLA’s grants.,"In summary
UC researchers claim a judge’s previous order barred the National Science Foundation from suspending UCLA’s grants. 


A federal judge today ordered lawyers for the Trump administration to explain why last week’s suspension of about 300 UCLA grants by the National Science Foundation does not run afoul of that judge’s June order barring the agency from terminating additional grants. 
The California district court judge, Rita F. Lin, set a hearing for Aug. 12. Lin’s order is a response to a Monday filing from lawyers representing University of California researchers. They wrote in  their filing to Lin that the science foundation must undo last week’s suspensions. Their filing is part of an ongoing case that challenged the legality of the National Science Foundation’s terminating 114 UC grants this spring over alleged Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion violations. Lin issued a preliminary injunction in June ordering the science foundation to restore the grants and barred the agency from additional terminations. 
Lawyers for the UC professors believe their filing is the first legal challenge to the National Science Foundation’s decision last week to suspend UCLA’s grants. Federal Department of Justice lawyers representing the science agency argue the suspensions do not violate Lin’s June preliminary injunction.
The latest dispute highlights the extent to which ongoing and new legal challenges feed off each other. It’s also the latest chapter in the Trump administration’s multi-pronged efforts to cancel university research funding and punish campuses for alleged DEI violations. Some federal judges have faulted the Trump administration for never defining what it considers DEI but cancelling funding to schools based on those violations anyway.
With last week’s suspensions, around $170 million in grant funding are on pause and researchers at UCLA cannot use any remaining funding to conduct their experiments. The National Science Foundation is among the largest sources of science research grants to universities. Campuses rely on the funding to make scientific breakthroughs, provide graduate students training and sustain the research apparatus that has made the U.S. arguably the world’s leader in scientific discovery.
The UCLA suspensions followed a federal Department of Justice report last week that accused  the campus of not doing enough to address antisemitism, particularly related to events during last year’s pro-Palestine protests. The report came months after UCLA commissioned a task force to investigate antisemitism on campus and come up with recommendations that UCLA leaders said they’d implement.The Department of Justice told UCLA it has until today to signal a willingness to come to an agreement to address antisemitism. Otherwise, the department said it will file a complaint with a federal court by Sept. 2.
How a June court case is related to UCLA suspensions
In June, Lin ordered the National Science Foundation to reinstate 114 National Science Foundation grants to UCLA that the agency terminated in the spring. She also barred the agency from freezing most other grants. Lin ordered two other agencies that terminated UC grants to do the same — The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The latter two agencies appealed that decision but in the meantime all three agencies returned the grants to UC researchers by mid-July.Lin’s order affected two types of grants: those the federal agencies cancelled with a termination form that used vague or generic language about the project not meeting agency priorities or those the agencies claimed ran afoul of President Donald Trump’s bans on DEI funding.
After the science foundation suspended UCLA’s grants on Wednesday, lawyers for the UC researchers wrote to the district court judge on Monday to argue the agency was violating her order because the grant funding was in effect halted by the suspensions.In response, federal Department of Justice lawyers wrote to Lin on Monday that a suspension isn’t the same as a termination, which is what Lin barred in her June preliminary injunction. And they say that the suspensions weren’t based on Trump’s executive orders but instead on the science foundation’s accusations that UCLA uses race-based admissions, allows transgender women to compete in women’s sports and hasn’t done enough to address antisemitism on its campus. All three points were laid out in a letter a National Science Foundation administrator,  Lisa Scott-Morring, sent to UCLA on Aug. 1.California has barred public campuses from admitting students based on race since voters in 1996 ended the practice. Scott-Morring acknowledged in her letter to UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk that the campus maintains it doesn’t use affirmative action, but wrote that its “holistic review” admissions process is de-facto race-based admissions.The National Science Foundation believes that “UCLA’s ‘holistic review’ admissions process, which considers factors such as an applicant’s neighborhood/zip code, family income, and school profile — and invites the disclosure of an applicant’s race via personal statements — is a transparent attempt to engage in race-based admissions in all but name,” Scott-Morring wrote. 
While the Supreme Court in 2023 overturned the use of race in college admissions in a 6-3 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote on behalf of the majority that students are free to discuss their identities and overcoming hardships in admissions essays.“Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,” Roberts wrote.All three criticisms in Scott-Morring’s letter match the policies Trump is pursuing through executive actions to reshape higher education and the federal government. They also resemble the policy playbook fleshed out in Project 2025, a conservative publication that has shaped Trump’s current term in office.
“NSF is willing to work with UCLA to identify corrective actions to bring UCLA into compliance. UCLA must acknowledge in writing its willingness to discuss these corrective actions by August 15,” Scott-Morring wrote.Lawyers for the UC professors argued that the Scott-Morring letters aren’t strong enough justifications to suspend the grants. “Both letters entirely fail to explain why the specific project was found to be incompatible with the Agency’s priorities,” the lawyers wrote to Lin on Monday. They stress the lack of explanation for why individual awards were terminated because that was one of their winning arguments that led Lin to order the grants reinstated in June.And they argue that the distinction between a termination and a suspension “is purely semantic”  because either way, researchers cannot access their funding. 
“NSF has violated the Preliminary Injunction and must immediately rescind the suspension of grants implicated in the July 30 and August 1 Letters,” the lawyers for the UC researchers wrote on Monday.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/021822-UCLA-Campus-File-RN-CM-45.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-05 19:56:52.334375

(Department of Energy)Elected officials in Kentucky hailed the signing of a lease Tuesday that will restart uranium enrichment in Paducah, saying it would be West Kentucky’s biggest ever economic development project once completed.
General Matter, led by Scott Nolan, a partner at the venture capital Founders Fund, plans to create high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, that smaller, advanced nuclear reactors often rely on for fuel. The startup has raised tens of millions of dollars and has the backing of entrepreneur and political activist Peter Thiel, who joined General Matter’s board. 
A release from the office of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear states the project will include a nearly $1.5 billion investment and create 140 jobs. The lease signed with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) allows for further federal permitting and licensing to advance the project at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, which enriched uranium into the 21st century until operations ceased in 2013. The DOE has worked for decades to clean up groundwater contamination at the site. The startup plans to enrich uranium at the site by 2030. 
“Seventy-five years ago, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected Paducah to help lead the nation’s original enrichment efforts,” said General Matter CEO Scott Nolan in a statement provided through the governor’s office. “We are proud to return to and reactivate this historic site to power a new era of American energy independence, and we thank our partners in Kentucky and at the DOE’s Office of Environmental Management and the Office of Nuclear Energy for supporting us in this landmark investment in American nuclear infrastructure.”
The startup is receiving $14 million in tax breaks from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority based on its projected investment and meeting targets, including creating 140 jobs across 15 years with an average hourly wage of $64, including benefits. 
The DOE last month also selected the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant as one of four sites where private developers will be invited to develop “cutting edge AI data center and energy generation projects.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Paducah-Site-has-shipped-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 19:56:52.334375

With the uptick in removal cases and the continuous transfer of immigrants across states, timely legal access is critical — but Vermont has few immigration attorneys to meet the need.

In mid-July, a group of attorneys and legal workers visited Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington to meet with women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention for a legal orientation. 
The visit brought into focus a reality the lawyers have become familiar with: without legal representation, immigrants face steep odds, and ICE’s frequent transfer of people between states makes access to legal counsel increasingly challenging.
The group found nine women in ICE detention, twice the number they expected. Most of the women weren’t represented by an attorney or weren’t sure if they had a lawyer.
Some women had been arrested in Vermont, while others had been transferred from facilities in other states, said Jill Martin Diaz, executive director of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, who organized the visit.
“Close to half the women didn’t know where they were,” said Emma Mutters Wood, a law fellow with VAAP.
Mutters Wood spoke with five women during the visit, she said, and three of them said they had been moved every few days. One said she had been detained for a week and transferred four times, with two of the trips lasting about 16 hours. The woman couldn’t name the states where she had been detained before, but said this was the first time she could speak with a lawyer, according to Mutters Wood.
The encounter highlighted the troubling lack of legal representation many people in immigration detention face at a time when they need it most. 
Only a small number of attorneys in Vermont practice immigration law, and even fewer take cases of removal proceedings, but the sharp rise in immigration cases in recent months has stretched their capacity to the limit. Left unrepresented, people who are detained are more likely to lose their cases and be deported and less likely to be released while their cases play out, experts say.
The group’s goal at Chittenden was to help the women understand their basic legal rights. Martin Diaz said some of the women didn’t have immigration paperwork with them during the visit, and some had never seen their paperwork or received a translation of the documents, so they didn’t know why they were detained. One of the women had already been granted release on bond a few days earlier and the bond was paid, but she hadn’t been released yet, according to the group. 
The day after the visit, the lawyers learned that five of the women they spoke with had been moved from Chittenden — two of them were later rebooked in the facility. The lawyers don’t know where they were transferred or why some were rebooked.
“The biggest takeaway for me,” Mutters Wood said, “was just, this is a very, very effective system for disappearing people before they have any opportunity for any kind of defense or any real substantive due process.”
Rapid transfers raise concerns about legal access
When federal immigration officials shuffle people from one detention center to the next, Mutters Wood said, those who are detained often lose access to their immigration paperwork, which has their identification number, information about their case, potential charges, and if they received a notice to appear in court.
“It’s actually pretty significant and important for people to know that information,” she said.
“This sort of shuffling people between facility to facility really is a very effective way to deny people their due process rights because it’s impossible to adequately state any form of defense or have any contact with the outside world when you’re being moved so frequently,” Mutters Wood said. 
People are also deprived of their right to request a bond hearing in this situation, she added, because if they are moved frequently and don’t know where they are, they don’t have enough information to complete and submit a bond request.
Andy Pelcher, a pro bono attorney working with VAAP, said the federal government has “no rational basis” for moving detained immigrants from facility to facility “other than to hinder access to counsel and frustrate their ability to successfully defend themselves.” 
He said he thinks the administration is trying to ramp up deportation proceedings to unprecedented levels, producing a caseload that the legal system is not designed to handle. Pelcher is trying to open a private practice specialized in immigration matters in the near future. 
Two of the women Mutters Wood met during the visit, who had been in Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility for longer periods, told her they had to wait more than three days to make a phone call, she said. So if people are transferred sooner, they may not be able to contact anyone in the meantime.
Kristen Connors, a private attorney focusing on immigration cases, said she has heard from clients and colleagues that people in immigration detention were held at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility or Northwest State Correctional Facility for a few days without being able to speak with a lawyer. Nathan Virag, an attorney with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, also said his clients reported being denied an initial phone call.
Haley Sommer, director of communications at the Department of Corrections, responded to VTDigger’s inquiries on the matter saying that any individual who enters a DOC facility can make a phone call immediately upon intake. Incarcerated individuals can make requests to add someone to their phone list, and generally requests are reviewed daily. But if someone has just arrived, it may take days for the request to be processed, she said.
“Time is really of the essence,” Martin Diaz said. “Every day that a person spends in detention without counsel is a day that ICE is scaring them in bad conditions, in literal prison conditions, with the purpose of motivating people to self-deport.”
Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, denied the claim that the government is intentionally making it harder for detained immigrants to access legal counsel.
“Any allegations that ICE is transferring illegal aliens to make the legal process as grueling as possible are FALSE,” she said in an emailed response to VTDigger. McLaughlin claimed that all detainees have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and family members, then outlined a current Trump administration policy that encourages self-deportation as an alternative to detention.
An immigration system under strain
Unlike in criminal cases, immigrants facing deportation aren’t guaranteed a public defender, so many people end up going through these complex proceedings alone. 
According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, based on data collected through June, there are 852 pending immigration cases in Vermont. Of those, 365 people  — or 42.8% of cases — officially have legal representation.
Chittenden County has the highest number of pending immigration cases in Vermont, but only 39% have legal representation.
Right now, a rough patchwork of legal groups across the state are anchoring the legal response to the climbing numbers of immigration detainments and deportation cases. The Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, in addition to Martin Diaz, staffs three attorneys and has about five to 10 pro-bono attorneys each month who provide limited or full representation. At the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at the Vermont Law & Graduate School, director Brett Stokes takes active removal cases while teaching law students, who work with him on some cases. 
Nathan Virag with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont is taking removal cases for the first time due to the greater demand of representation in this field, while in the private sector, Connors seems to be the only attorney providing removal defense at the moment.
The lawyers agreed that when people have an attorney representing them, their chances of success increase dramatically. A 2016 nationwide study by the American Immigration Council showed that represented immigrants were twice as likely as unrepresented immigrants to achieve the legal result they sought, and the immigrants in detention who had a custody hearing were four times more likely to be released if represented.
Immigration lawyers have found that filing a habeas corpus petition with a federal district court is the best approach, Pelcher said, because it forces the government to provide legal justification for keeping an immigrant in custody.
Lawyers can also submit a request to prevent their client from being moved to another state and then make a request for bond. In recent cases of immigration detention in Vermont, such as the ones of Heidi Perez and Jose Ignacio “Nacho” De La Cruz and Esther Ngoy Tekele, the lawyers successfully prevented the transfer or their clients and obtained bond releasing them from jail to ensure they could be with their family while their cases move forward in court, which can be a lengthy process.  
In addition, attorneys can file a motion to request an online hearing to avoid traveling to Boston, where the closest immigration court is. However, people without legal representation are automatically required to attend in person and may have more difficulties understanding how to file the motion to change hearing format and gathering the information to make that request.
In January, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order to expand expedited removal proceedings for undocumented immigrants who can’t prove they have lived in the U.S. for at least two years, including individuals who entered the country unlawfully or those who had their parole status revoked.
Often, people meet border patrol agents before they have a chance to file an asylum application since the process might take time given the shortage of asylum lawyers, Martin Diaz said. When these encounters happen, immigration officers can decide to place the person in expedited removal before they get in front of a judge. Immigrants placed in expedited removal cannot be released on bond.
“The resources are so constrained. It’s only when someone is detained and, like, at risk of immediate removal, then they finally make contact with a lawyer,” Martin Diaz said.
An overstretched legal community
With more cases of removal proceedings against immigrants, the few lawyers practicing immigration law in Vermont have seen their caseload grow exponentially. 
“I think I probably had three or four clients who were in removal proceedings pre-January,” Connors said. “Now I have about, I would say, 15 clients who have active removal proceedings.” 
While Vermont has allocated funds to civil legal aid in the past, it has never appropriated money for immigration legal aid, according to Martin Diaz.
The state’s reliance on the law school clinic to provide a high volume of legal support is unsustainable, Martin Diaz said. Law school clinics have limited intake parameters and their priority is teaching students, who need guidance and don’t necessarily have the capacity to take too many cases, they added.
One reason for the shortage of immigration lawyers in Vermont, Connors said, is that the nearest immigration court is in Boston and, before the COVID-19 pandemic, most hearings occurred in person.
“The immigration legal services sector in Vermont was not developed in tandem with how quickly our communities diversified,” Martin Diaz said. “We’re welcoming all of these new communities, and the challenge is that we did not invest in the legal support that they need to achieve long-term stability and safety at a proportional rate.”
Attorneys have increasingly volunteered to receive training and take on immigration cases, but the demand is still too large, Martin Diaz said. 
Expanding the immigration legal sector in Vermont is going to take time. Meanwhile, legal visits to the facilities where immigrants are detained may be the only way unrepresented people in immigration detention have access to some form of legal counsel, or contact with the outside world in general.
Martin Diaz and the other volunteers said they spent about four hours in the law library of Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility speaking with the women in ICE detention, the first time they were able to hold a legal training in the facility. 
“The initial feedback we got was just one of emotional, overwhelming gratitude,” Martin Diaz said. “Everyone wanted to talk all at once because this is the moment that they’ve been waiting for.”

Higher severance and ad valorem payments are not expected to offset federal mineral royalty reductions, according to state financial forecasters. 
The post Forecasters: Big Beautiful Bill will cost Wyoming $50M in coal royalties appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming will lose approximately $50 million in annual revenue to the lower federal mineral royalty rates for coal contained in the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill, according to a report by state financial forecasters.
Companies pay royalties to the federal government for minerals extracted from federal lands. The feds then generally split those dollars evenly with the government of the state in which the mineral production took place. In Wyoming, those royalties help fund K-12 education, highways and county roads, city and town services and the University of Wyoming.
The Big Beautiful Bill, signed by President Donald Trump last month, reduced the federal royalty rate for coal from 12.5% to 7%, a discount that is “estimated to reduce Wyoming’s share of [federal mineral royalty] revenue by approximately $50 million per year, depending upon production levels,” according to the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group’s July report.
Known as CREG, the group makes revenue forecasts each October and January, and provides revenue updates on major sources in April and July. The Wyoming Legislature relies on CREG’s estimates to craft the state’s budget.
Supporters of the Big Beautiful Bill, including Wyoming’s federal delegation, touted the legislation as a way to boost coal production.
“This law empowers states to produce more energy. That certainly includes my home state of Wyoming,” Republican U.S. Sen. John Barrasso said on the Senate floor. “It encourages increased coal production on federal lands. It cuts red tape. It creates opportunities for our energy producers.”
State revenue forecasters, however, do not predict the rate reduction will be offset in state coffers.
“This reduced revenue will be modestly offset by higher severance and ad valorem payments as companies will be able to deduct a lower amount of FMRs; however, this offset is small compared to the reduced FMRs,” the CREG report states.
The federal legislation also reduces the royalty rate on oil and natural gas, but those discounts only apply to new production, so their “impact to state revenue is much less,” according to the report.
Altogether, $50 million represents a fraction of Wyoming’s revenue picture. The state’s main operating account, for example, is predicted to reach roughly $1.4 billion by the end of the 2025 fiscal year.
Even so, the loss “should concern people,” Joint Appropriations Committee member Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, told WyoFile.
The good news is that Wyoming has come to rely more heavily on investment income, Gierau said, making such a hit to royalties less painful for the state.
“Forty percent of our general fund revenue is interest income. That’s amazing,” Gierau said, adding that the tourism industry is another bright spot. But lowering royalty rates won’t budge coal’s downward trajectory, he said
“It’s going to be left up to the state of Wyoming to fill in the gaps, and that’s something they don’t talk about. We’re going to get left holding the bag and the bill,” Gierau said.
Joint Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by publication time.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein opposes a reorganization of the Department of Motor Vehicles that would make it a standalone agency, his office indicated Tuesday.
A day after the release of State Auditor Dave Boliek’s report recommending to split off the DMV from the North Carolina Department of Transportation, his report has drawn mixed reactions, particularly among Democratic officials and state government employees.
Boliek argued in the 435-page audit report that operating as a standalone agency would better allow the DMV to make budget and staffing requests directly to the governor and the General Assembly and engage in statewide planning.
A spokesperson for Stein wrote in a statement that he would not support the split, citing cost and logistical hurdles.
“The Governor appreciates the Auditor taking the time to produce a comprehensive report on the DMV,” the spokesperson wrote. “While our office agrees with many of the findings and DMV is already working on improvements, we also believe any restructuring would be costly and time-consuming and would distract from our shared goal of fixing the most critical issues at the DMV.”
That position echoes the rationale under which DMV Commissioner Paul Tine and Transportation Secretary Joey Hopkins opposed the proposal. In a seven-page response to the audit, they wrote that “enhanced collaboration between the DOT and the DMV is essential to accelerating progress on key customer experience and operational efficiency initiatives.”
“Separating would require significant resources and would distract from efforts to improve customer experience and operations at DMV,” they wrote. “DMV faces budgetary constraints that could be more effectively solved with other mechanisms.”










The legislature has sole control over how many people work at DMV. That’s the way it is, statutory authority lies with the legislature. They have sole control over pay increases for state employees, including DMV employees


– SEANC Executive Director Ardis Watkins

Ardis Watkins, executive director of the State Employees Association of North Carolina, also shared reservations about the recommendation in an interview with NC Newsline.
“I’m afraid the next thing is going to be a march towards some kind of privatization, which doesn’t help anybody, especially the taxpayers, who would pay more under a privatized scheme,” Watkins said. Republicans in the General Assembly have long wanted to privatize the agency.
She said her organization appreciates the efforts Boliek took to contact workers and highlight their concerns, particularly around low pay and workplace safety, but she said those takeaways should have been the key message of the report, rather than the restructuring recommendation. What matters is that the legislature act to remedy pay and staffing issues, she said.
“The legislature has sole control over how many people work at DMV. That’s the way it is, statutory authority lies with the legislature. They have sole control over pay increases for state employees, including DMV employees,” Ardis said. “I hope that not only will the legislature hear Auditor Boliek, that we need more people and we need to pay them enough to keep them, but I hope they’ll understand this goes beyond DMV.”
Wayne Goodwin, the former head of the DMV appointed by former Gov. Roy Cooper, wrote on social media that he felt “vindication at today’s news,” with many of Boliek’s findings echoing concerns he raised.
“My hope is that all the stakeholders — especially the Legislature — will *work together* with others and *not attack, belittle, demonize, point fingers at, and politicize* an agency, its dedicated workers, and its agency leaders whose mutual aims are to provide secure credentials in an efficient manner, reduce lines, and shrink wait times,” Goodwin wrote.
North Carolina GOP Chair Jason Simmons said in a press release that the state of the agency is an indictment on Cooper’s tenure, as the former governor’s Senate campaign kicks into gear.
“Auditor Boliek and his team are revealing mismanagement of this agency under the tenure of Roy Cooper,” Simmons said. “We greatly appreciate Auditor Boliek’s effort to deliver on a campaign promise to clean up state government. As for Cooper, once again we see he was more concerned with the needs of left-wing special interests than the people of North Carolina.”
In a press conference presenting the report Monday, Boliek attributed blame for staffing and technology issues to past leadership, though not just to Cooper.
“I would assume that if the governor had been paying attention to what was going on previously, that something would have been done to assist the DMV,” he said. “Multiple governors have known about this.”
Stein’s office wrote that “with the right leadership and follow-through, we will get results,” expressing support for Tine as the DMV’s new head.
“We are already impressed with the speed at which Commissioner Tine and his team are making much-needed improvements,” Stein’s spokesperson wrote. “We look forward to continued partnership with DOT, DMV, and the Auditor’s Office to reduce wait times and deliver a better customer experience.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182519-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-05 18:56:36.966997

Leaders in Vermont schools and local food networks are expressing a mixture of hope and concern following the recent acquisition of a local family-run food service provider by a larger, out-of-state company. 
Whitsons, a New York-based food service company backed by private equity firm GenNx360 Capital Partners, announced last month that it had acquired The Abbey Group, a longstanding food provider based in Enosburg Falls. The Abbey Group currently holds contracts with schools to serve meals in a dozen Vermont counties, and operates several corporate food courts, including in the Vermont State House. 
The acquisition comes at a tough moment for schools working to connect with local producers after cuts to federal school lunch programs in March. But Karen Dittrich, a senior vice president at Whitsons, said the new parent company was committed to maintaining the Abbey Group’s connections with local providers.
The sale marks Whitsons’ second acquisition of a smaller food service company serving Vermont in as many years. Last year, the company purchased Fresh Picks Café. Whitsons’ expansion into Vermont has raised larger questions for local leaders about what kind of management is most effective for school nutrition programs.
Fresh Picks’ contract with the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union — one of the company’s major Vermont relationships — didn’t last long following Whitsons’ takeover last year. 
According to Susan Grabowski, the supervisory union’s food program coordinator, the Whitsons’ acquisition of Fresh Picks instantly caused problems.
The new food operator failed to meet the agreed-upon bar for local food purchases, according to Grabowski. There were issues with quality control, portion sizes, and allowances for extra helpings. By the fall, Grabowski said, she was getting daily complaints from students and families. 
Additionally, she said, poor treatment and wages caused a higher rate of staff turnover. Grabowski felt cut off from the provider’s corporate office, though there were eventually some improvements after school officials complained to Whitsons management.
“It just became harder and harder to get information that we needed … and to get the food that we wanted to be able to serve to our students,” Grabowski said.
Whitsons declined to comment on its former contract with Windham Southeast.
In December, a team that included Grabowski presented a proposal to the school board to end the contract with Fresh Picks Café and Whitsons and transition to a self-operated kitchen with a greater emphasis on local food. The board agreed, despite the extra expense the change would incur. 
Food service costs will rise from $2.4 million to roughly $2.6 million annually in addition to some transitional costs, the supervisory union’s business administrator Frank Rucker told the Bennington Banner earlier this year.
It’s money, Grabowski noted, that not every school board might feel able to spare even if it wanted to separate from external food providers. With historic financial restructuring on the horizon for Vermont schools, and a number of preliminary school budgets already failing, local leaders might be wary of costly new projects.
On top of state-level changes, local-focused school lunch programs across the state were hit by federal budget cuts this spring, which froze funding from the Local Food for Schools and Child Care Cooperative Agreement and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program. Earlier this year, the state legislature approved one-time funding that essentially replaced federal payouts for the latter program, but in coming years, school districts cannot expect that money to recur.
“School nutrition is not safe from the pressures of other food service operations,” said Grabowski. “It feels like we’re at a crossroads.”
Kris Nelson, the Farm-to-School program manager at Food Connects in Brattleboro, said that working with a self-run provider is an inherently different dynamic. She has worked with the Windham Southeast program through both the Fresh Picks era and the current transitional period.
“It’s not that [outside] companies aren’t able to make real headway in terms of purchasing locally,” she said. “One of the main distinctions is just simply that [self-operated kitchens are] not a profit-driven endeavor.”
“Your bottom line is nutritional food for children,” Nelson said of operations like Grabowski’s.
Several school districts and food providers said they remain hopeful that Whitsons’ recent acquisition of The Abbey Group will yield positive results. 
The Abbey Group has been a major partner of and contributor to Green Mountain Farm-to-School —  an organization that works to connect farms to school food purchasers with a view to improving nutrition and sourcing — for over a decade.
“It’s been a very positive relationship,” said Catherine Cusack, Green Mountain Farm-to-School’s executive director. She said The Abbey Group has been “really open to trying to work with new producers, trying new crops.”
Dittrich, the Whitsons’ spokesperson, said the company is proud of its new affiliation with Green Mountain Farm-to-School and plans to expand its participation in coming years. Cusack confirmed that Whitsons had reached out about continuing the organizations’ work together.
“This partnership is grounded in a shared commitment to nourishing communities through wholesome, locally sourced meals and personalized service,” Dittrich said in a statement. 
“I’m hopeful that we will continue the business as usual,” Cusack said. “I’m sure some things will change.”
Several school districts which work with The Abbey Group told VTDigger they have no plans to seek changes to their school meal contracts for the coming year. Dittrich said there will be no immediate changes to on-site staff, nor will there be cost adjustments for schools.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s House speaker said Tuesday a “bizarre accident” likely caused images of nude women to appear on state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ office TV.
Two law enforcement agencies said Tuesday that they are still investigating.
Walters recently had a Samsung TV installed in his office that, when powered on, automatically displayed the ​​Samsung TV Plus Channel 1204 (Movie Hub Action), House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said in a news release. 
Hilbert said he learned Tuesday morning from Samsung that the channel was airing the 1985 film “The Protector” followed by the 2017 film “The Foreigner” during the timeframe when two members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education reported seeing the explicit images during a private portion of their July 24 meeting.
Descriptions of scenes in the “The Protector” are consistent with what board members reported seeing on Walters’ TV, Hilbert said. The film also matches images of a doctor, a nurse and a white lab coat that Walters told Hilbert he saw when he turned around toward the TV screen, according to the speaker’s release.

Walters previously said the board members’ allegations were “categorically false” and suggested it was a set-up by Gov. Kevin Stitt, whose appointees made the claims. His office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hilbert said he and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services investigated the matter. He contacted a government affairs specialist at Samsung to request what aired on that channel during the time and date of the meeting, he said.
The cause of the images, Hilbert said, seems to be the TV’s default display, not an intentional act by Walters or his staff. A planned conspiracy is also “highly unlikely,” he said.
“In my opinion, the most plausible explanation for what occurred that day is that the television, which had only been in the superintendent’s office for fewer than two months, automatically launched Samsung’s free streaming service and began playing a film that contained explicit content, without anyone in the room realizing it at the time,” Hilbert said. “This information seems to vindicate both the state superintendent as well as the two board members.”
The two board members, Becky Carson and Ryan Deatherage, did not immediately return requests for comment Tuesday afternoon.
The Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation are still investigating the matter, representatives of both agencies confirmed.
The Senate president pro tem’s office didn’t immediately comment on Hilbert’s report.

Wastewater surveillance — a recently expanded public health tool that involves studying traces of diseases in sewage water — doesn’t necessarily mean officials will detect cases of the infectious disease they spot. But the detection suggests someone had measles in the North Idaho area. 
Idaho health officials have not reported any measles cases in state residents this year, during the nation’s worst outbreak of the highly contagious virus in decades.

Idaho health officials believe someone in the Coeur d’Alene area was infected with measles, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn said in an interview. But officials aren’t sure whether they were traveling through the area, or if they even knew they had measles, she said. 
“We think this is real. And we want to use it to say to people, ‘Hey, measles is in the area. Please check your immunity records. Consider making sure you’re up to date and your children are up to date on the measles vaccine,’” Hahn told the Idaho Capital Sun on Tuesday.
The measles virus was detected in Coeur d’Alene from a sample taken on July 29, the Panhandle Health District announced last week. 
The health district did not know of any suspected or confirmed measles cases in its area in North Idaho, but encouraged medical providers to consider measles as a possible diagnosis for people who have similar symptoms, according to the health alert issued Aug. 1.
 What to do if you’re exposed to measles

The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis and, in rare cases, death. A high fever, cough, runny nose, rash and red, watery eyes are common measles symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, says. 
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
 Vaccination is the best measles prevention, officials say. But Idaho has a spotty vaccination rate

Measles — which can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves — is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, health officials say. 
Idaho has the lowest rate of kindergartners — nearly four out of every five — who are reportedly up to date on their measles vaccine, according to CDC data.
Idaho’s COVID data set for disruption after state lawmakers reject millions in federal aid

On average, nearly 91.6% of kindergartners across the U.S. are up to date on their measles vaccine, compared to 78.5% of Idaho kids, the data show. 
But a separate CDC vaccine survey found a higher measles vaccination rate for young Idaho kids, estimated at 88.7%. 
And some of the one-fifth of Idaho kindergarteners without confirmed vaccination rates might be vaccinated, Hahn told the Sun.
Idaho has the highest opt out rate for school vaccine requirements, with 14% of parents opting their kids out compared to just 3% nationally, Idaho Education News reported. 
“Those parents that are saying ‘I’m exempting my child from this requirement,’” Hahn said. “That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unvaccinated. … We can’t exactly call it a (vaccination) rate for that reason.”
 The United States’ worst measles outbreak in decades

The United States is experiencing its worst outbreak of the highly contagious measles virus in decades, Stateline reported. This year, health officials have confirmed 1,333 measles cases across 40 states by late July, the CDC says. 
In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. thanks to vaccines. 
In May, South Central Public Health District reported that a visitor to Idaho had measles.
Idaho has not reported cases of state residents with measles since 2023, when an outbreak in southwest Idaho led to 10 measles cases, Hahn said. The outbreak started with an Idaho resident exposed during international travel, she said.

(Courtesy of City of Omaha)OMAHA — The future North Omaha ‘innovation district’ set to launch with help from $30 million in state funding will be the topic of a community workshop hosted Thursday by the Omaha Inland Port Authority.
With public input encouraged, the gathering — from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the Swanson Conference Center on Metropolitan Community College’s Fort Omaha campus — will feature interaction with a project consultant exploring ideas for how the district will look and operate.
The district is intended to support entrepreneurship, job creation and economic growth through cutting-edge startups and creative businesses. It is to reflect community culture, needs and policies that “promote inclusive growth without displacement” of residents or businesses, according to a statement from Manne Cook, an urban planner with Lamp Rynearson, part of the consulting team.
Ideas flow at public meeting for new North Omaha innovation district fueled by $30M state grant

Thursday’s meeting builds upon one held in May that kicked off a six-month visioning process for the new district to be developed within the boundaries of the port authority’s roughly 3,000 acres in North Omaha, near Eppley Airfield.
Community members are encouraged also to review “guiding principles” for the initiative and comment online through Aug. 14. 
The innovation district is one of the major projects to be steered by the authority’s nine-member governing board, which formed last year. 
Also planned in the designated area is an industrial-focused business park funded by a separate $90 million state grant. 
Inland port authorities were created as a tool by the Nebraska Legislature to help stimulate jobs and businesses. Lawmakers bestowed powers on such entities, which must be approved by the state as well as the city, that include selling bonds to finance construction and infrastructure within the designated zone.
Omaha’s Inland Port Authority Board is scheduled to meet earlier the same Thursday, Aug. 7, for its regularly scheduled monthly meeting. That gathering, at 9 a.m., is to be held in Building 21 at Metro’s Fort Omaha campus.

(Bonnie Jones, Black Hills National Forest/USDA Forest Service)A planned gold exploration project in South Dakota’s northern Black Hills has resulted in 1,774 written comments from local officials, tribal nations and others, including many who say the drilling would threaten Spearfish Canyon.
Solitario Resources, a Colorado-based company, plans up to 49 drill sites on public land. Many of the sites are just above and beyond the eastern rim of a canyon segment extending southwest from Cheyenne Crossing, 13 miles south of Spearfish. The company will study core samples from the drilling to determine the potential for a mine.
The U.S. Forest Service has an obligation under the General Mining Law of 1872 to permit mineral exploration on federal lands that haven’t been closed to exploration or mining. After an initial review of the project plan, the Forest Service said the project may not have enough extraordinary circumstances to require an environmental assessment. Opponents argue the location’s geology and cultural significance meet the legal threshold for further environmental scrutiny.

The Forest Service received the written feedback during a recent public comment period. 
In an opposition resolution signed July 21, Spearfish Mayor John Senden and the City Council noted the drill sites are within the Spearfish Creek watershed, a key recharge area for the Madison aquifer, which supplies the city’s water. The resolution said that without a deeper study into the environmental impacts, the city opposes the project.
Some letters raised concern about the drilling happening near the canyon’s fragile rock formations, and whether that might cause rocks to come tumbling down. 
The Norbeck Society, a local conservation group, wrote that the Forest Service should take a “hard look” at the project’s environmental impact.
“The impacts on water quality and species viability of animals in the project and across the forest are concerning,” the society wrote.
Some of the proposed drill sites are located near trails, which commenters said are used by hikers, hunters and off-road vehicle users year-round. Solitario’s plan would disrupt the quiet area, some commenters wrote.
“Our organization exists to protect the outdoor heritage of hunting and fishing in a natural setting, and we do so through active stewardship of the wild public lands, waters, and wildlife that make these traditions possible,” wrote Cody Grewing, chair of South Dakota Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “As such, we are deeply concerned about the potential impacts that this project poses to the ecological, recreational, and cultural integrity of the northern Black Hills.”

Solitario is not new to exploratory drilling near Spearfish Canyon. The company drilled 11 holes averaging 1,300 feet deep last year in another area near the canyon, after receiving approval for that plan in April 2024.
Chris Herald, Solitario Resources’ chief executive officer, said further environmental studies are unnecessary and called the concerns regarding water impacts unfounded. He said drill holes are filled before the rig ever leaves the drill site, and the company has a $125,000 reclamation bond to help cover any problems.
Solitario is one of several companies conducting exploratory drilling in various areas of the Black Hills, which has been mined continually since the late 1800s. Since the closure of the massive Homestake Mine, the only large-scale, active gold mine in the region is the Wharf Mine near Lead.
“The Homestake-Wharf district is one of the most important gold districts in the United States,” Herald said. “If we do find a gold deposit, it will provide the highest paying jobs in the local area.” 
The Forest Service will now review the comments and determine whether to approve the plan with changes to minimize impacts identified by opponents, or whether enough extraordinary circumstances exist to require an environmental assessment.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/51476145935_dae2b7565a_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 18:56:36.966997

Gretchen Whitmer looks on as U.S. President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on April 09, 2025 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Gov. Gretchen Whitmer continues to have President Donald Trump’s ear and met with him in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday to discuss the impact in Michigan of tariffs and cuts to Medicaid in the latest federal budget.
Whitmer’s team told Michigan Advance that the governor presented Trump with information about Medicaid and tariffs, but also jobs and opportunities burgeoning in Genesee County. One of the key talking points was a request for a longer transition period for some of the major cuts to Medicaid.
The governor also met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump Chief of Staff Susie Wiles while at the White House.
“I’ve always said that I’ll work with anyone to get things done for Michigan. That’s why I’ve continued to go to Washington, D.C. to make sure that Michiganders are front and center when critical decisions are being made,” Whitmer said in a statement. “This year alone, we’ve secured major, bipartisan wins including a new fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, funding to protect our Great Lakes from invasive carp, and federal disaster support for communities in Northern Michigan impacted by historic ice storms.”

On Medicaid and the cuts detailed in the president’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Whitmer asked Trump for a larger buffer for the changes to take effect, noting that millions of Michiganders – including seniors, people with disabilities, new moms and rural constituents – would likely experience disruptions. The request was aimed at lessening those disruptions.
Whitmer told Trump that Michigan was also seeking flexibility and clarity after recent changes to the Insurance Provider Assessment, a health care related tax with both a fixed and variable rate structure on non-Medicaid health insurers, prepaid inpatient health plans and Medicaid managed care services.
Two changes were sought from Trump. First, Whitmer asked Trump for a three-year period allowing Michigan to bring in stakeholders to develop a new, federally compliant structure that maintains Medicaid stability. Second, Whitmer asked the president for deeper collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to build a framework ensuring provider assessments meet the current policy.
Whitmer told Trump that the assessment generates substantial revenue for Medicaid and has a total statewide impact of around $2.7 billion, and Medicaid represents one-third of the state’s budget.
Giving Michigan flexibility would help more than 2.6 million residents, Whitmer said.
On tariffs, Whitmer shared with Trump the negative impact they are starting to have and will have in the future.
With Michigan’s economy tied to the auto industry, tariffs have a disproportionate impact on that sector, a note she relayed to Trump, who bragged about how much he loved the American and Michigan auto industry relentlessly on the 2016, 2020 and 2024 campaign trails. Whitmer extolled to Trump that 9.2% of the state’s gross domestic product came from auto manufacturing.
Trump’s signature USMCA trade deal pumped investment into Michigan, with $23.2 billion from automakers and $14.7 billion from auto suppliers.
Advanced manufacturing in Genesee County was also an item of discussion, with Whitmer encouraging Trump to work with her and other Michigan officials to grow that site for American jobs. Whitmer called the site a nation-leading asset ready for a bigger, better deal – which is how she posed it to Trump.

Whitmer said that Michigan is ready to work with locals, Republicans, Democrats and the private sector to get it done and make generational investments in Flint.
“We should do everything in our power to lower costs and grow more good-paying jobs in Michigan,” Whitmer said. “I appreciate the president’s time and attention to the matters we discussed.”

,Source New Mexico,2025-08-05 22:21:31+00:00,Source New Mexico,Feds list Albuquerque as NM’s sole “sanctuary” jurisdiction,Julia Goldberg,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/briefs/feds-list-albuquerque-as-nms-sole-sanctuary-jurisdiction/,"The federal government has once again posted a list of sanctuary jurisdictions. This time, Albuquerque is the only NM locale on it. (Getty illustration)","Albuquerque is the only surviving ""sanctuary jurisdiction"" listed by the Trump administration in a new list published Aug. 5, 2025.The United States Department of Justice on Tuesday published a list of so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions,” which it defined in a news release as “states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”
Albuquerque appeared as the only New Mexico locale on the list.
The USDOJ list follows a U.S. Department of Homeland Security list published last May of sanctuary jurisdictions that included 23 of New Mexico’s 33 counties, along with the City of Albuquerque and the City of Santa Fe. That list followed President Donald Trump’s executive order in April requiring such a list.
The DHS list prompted confusion from some jurisdictions and outcry from local sheriffs, and was subsequently taken off line within a few days. 
States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

The Department of Justice also published a list of “sanctuary jurisdiction characteristics,” which include public declarations of sanctuary status; local laws or rules limiting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and restrictions on information about “immigration status of detainees with federal authorities” to name a few. The DOJ notes the jurisdictions included in Tuesday’s list “were made after a thorough review of documented laws, ordinances, and executive directives by the listed jurisdictions. This initial list of designated Sanctuary Jurisdictions will be reviewed regularly, to include additional jurisdictions and remove jurisdictions that have remediated their policies, practices, and laws. Each state, county, and city will have an opportunity to respond to its placement on the list.”
As of the beginning of July, 34 cities and counties, including Chicago and Los Angeles, had asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda, including Albuquerque (Santa Fe is already part of the suit).
Filings for that suit note that Albuquerque “has been a welcoming city” since 2000, when the city council passed “its first immigrant-friendly city resolution,” which states that “municipal resources cannot be used to apprehend individuals solely on the basis of their immigration status, unless required by law.”
On July 21, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller signed an executive order reaffirming the city’s position as an “immigrant-friendly city,” as some members of the City Council said they would push further protections in city ordinances later this year.

“In the face of federal actions and proposals that undermine human rights and respect, sow fear and destabilization among our families, and damage our economy and threaten our public safety, the City of Albuquerque reaffirms its moral, legal and policy duty to uphold civil rights, public safety and serve all residents with dignity,” Keller said during a signing event for the order.
In a news release announcing the new USDOJ list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement that “sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design. The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”
Source has requested comment from both Keller and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on the new sanctuary list and will update this story if and when they are received.

“This will make it harder for people to meet their most basic needs,” one advocate said. Overall, 65,000 Vermonters rely on SNAP benefits.

Thousands of Vermonters could lose access to nutritional benefits funded by the federal government in the coming years as a result of cuts laid out in the sweeping Republican-led spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law last month. 
The reductions, along with many other measures in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are designed to fund parts of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, including an extension of tax breaks that estimates show will benefit wealthy people the most, as well as major increases in funding for border security and immigration enforcement, among other changes. 
State officials and advocates emphasized in recent weeks that they haven’t yet tallied the full impacts the tax and spending package could have on Vermont. But a number of provisions, they said, will undoubtedly make it harder for people to access food using the federal government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
About 65,000 people currently receive SNAP benefits — commonly known as food stamps — in Vermont, according to Ivy Enoch, policy director for Hunger Free Vermont, a nonprofit that advocates for ending systemic hunger in the state. Her organization estimates as many as 14,000 of them could see nutritional benefits they rely on reduced or eliminated entirely as a result of the legislation.

“This will make it harder for people to meet their most basic needs,” Enoch told VTDigger. “Fundamentally, it will cause harm to every one of our communities — and it is also forcing our state to contend with really difficult decisions.”
Vermont’s SNAP program is called 3SquaresVT. People are generally eligible for the program if their household income is equal to or below certain thresholds established by the federal government, or if they receive the state’s earned income tax credit. The vast majority of SNAP benefit recipients in Vermont are children, older adults and people with disabilities, Enoch said.
Currently, many SNAP recipients between the ages of 18 and 59 are required to report to the federal government that they are working, or participating in a work training program, in order to receive their benefits. But the new law expands that work reporting requirement to certain people up to 65 years of age.
There are certain exceptions to those reporting requirements, including for parents with teenage kids. Currently, parents of children under age 18 can be exempt from requirements to work, but under the new law, many parents will only be able to claim an exemption if they have kids under 14. People experiencing homelessness, veterans and young people who have aged out of foster care could also be subject to new work reporting requirements, Enoch said.
Proponents of the changes have argued they would ensure more people are working and that SNAP benefits are reserved for people with the greatest needs. But research has shown that existing requirements do not increase employment and have only pushed more people off of the safety net program. 
Enoch said many SNAP recipients who can work, do work.
“This rule will be expanded to more people, who will need to take more time — that they don’t have — to fill out complex paperwork and submit it to the state,” she said. “And the state will then need to review more paperwork, creating more burden on both.” 
Hunger Free Vermont estimates many people in the state will start to face the prospect of losing their SNAP benefits in February 2026, though the timeline is not entirely clear, Enoch said.
A more immediate impact, she said, will be felt by immigrant communities in the state. Starting Oct. 1, under the new law, refugees and asylum seekers — who have lawful status to live in the U.S. — will no longer be able to access SNAP benefits. Hunger Free Vermont believes about 1,600 people in Vermont will no longer be eligible for federal nutritional benefits because of that change. 
The legislation also restricts future increases to the value of the nutrition plan the federal government uses to determine how much money many SNAP recipients should receive. Under the new law, the value of this “Thrifty Food Plan” will continue to reflect established cost-of-living increases. But barring future updates to the underlying value of the plan could mean SNAP payments lag over time, Enoch said.  
Beyond the cost of food for individuals, the legislation is also expected to put new pressure on states, including Vermont, to pay for administering SNAP programs.
While the federal government pays the cost of SNAP benefits, it shares the cost of administering SNAP programs with individual state governments. Right now, that burden is shared 50-50. But it’s slated to change starting in October 2026, Enoch said, to a cost share that’s 75% on states and 25% on the feds.
The Vermont Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Office reported last week that this change will cost Vermont $8 million a year starting in 2026. It’s one of many fiscal changes, prompted by Trump’s return to the White House, which state legislators will need to contend with when they return to Montpelier for the 2026 legislative session next January.
Other advocates have said a reduction in the number of people receiving SNAP benefits in Vermont could have broader impacts on the state’s food system.
The Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont runs a program called Crop Cash, which leverages federal funding to multiply the dollar value of SNAP benefits when recipients use them at local farmer’s markets. SNAP recipients spent more than $385,000 at markets across the state in 2024, according to the organization’s data. 
The organization is not immediately concerned about funding for the program itself. But if fewer people are shopping at farmer’s markets because they cannot afford to without SNAP benefits, local farmers could lose out on income, which could be a potentially painful hit on already tight margins, said Jessica Hays Lucas, a policy organizer for the association. 
“We’re just going to have so many fewer dollars in circulation,” she said, referring to SNAP benefits.

(Olivier Douliery/Getty Images)The two Planned Parenthood reproductive health clinics in Louisiana will close their doors at the end of next month, its regional leader announced. 
Its parent organization has cited a decrease in donor support and Trump administration policy as reasons for its cutbacks across the country. 
Anti-abortion activists have had Planned Parenthood in their crosshairs for decades, although neither the Baton Rouge or New Orleans locations have ever been licensed to perform the procedure. Its medical staff provides birth control, tests for sexually transmitted diseases, cancer screenings and other health care services.
“This is not a decision we wanted to make; it is one we were forced into by political warfare,” Melaney Linton, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, said in a statement. “Anti-reproductive health lawmakers obsessed with power and control have spent decades fighting the concept that people deserve to control their own bodies. These extremists have done everything they can to ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood, dismantle public health infrastructure, and block patients from the care they rely on. This cruelty and failed leadership are the reasons we are here today.”
A reduction in staff and services at Planned Parenthood facilities nationwide began even before Congress approved President Donald Trump’s expansive tax and spending measure in early July. Dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill, its provisions include a reduction in Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood clinics, even though federal money already cannot be used to administer abortions. The organization estimates about 200 of its more than 600 facilities are at risk of closing.
Gov. Jeff Landry called Planned Parenthood’s closure announcement “a major win for the pro-life movement here in Louisiana” in a social media post.
“I have fought hard as Attorney General and now as Governor to rid our state of this failed organization,” Landry wrote. “Abortion should NEVER be considered healthcare.”
Attorney General Liz Murrill, who was Landry’s solicitor general when he held the AG’s job, also celebrated the news of the clinic closures. 
“This is welcome news,” Murrill said in a statement. “Planned Parenthood built its business around promoting death. Louisiana choose [sic] life. We will always protect women and babies.” 
Benjamin Clapper, president of Louisiana Right to Life, said in a statement that Planned Parenthood could have chosen to remain in Louisiana had it stopped performing abortions. He added that the organization has spent $1 million in Louisiana and Texas to help pregnant women travel to other states where the procedure is legal. 
“Planned Parenthood is a national abortion business that has long sought to bring its abortion agenda to Louisiana,” Clapper said. “Today’s announcement is further indication that their priority has always been abortion and their profit margins rather than helping women.”
Abortion is allowed in very few instances under Louisiana law, specifically when the life of the mother is at risk, when she faces significant injury from delivery or if the fetus is not expected to survive. Some physicians in the state have been reluctant to perform such emergency abortions, saying state law doesn’t offer enough clarity on when the procedure is permissible. 
Health care professionals could face prison time and fines if they perform an illegal abortion in Louisiana. 
Murrill is attempting to prosecute a New York doctor for allegedly prescribing and mailing abortion medication to a Louisiana woman who gave the pills to her pregnant minor daughter. The physician, Dr. Margaret Carpenter, is protected by her state’s shield laws, which keep her from being extradited to face charges in Louisiana. Murrill and other Republican attorneys general have called on Congress to strike down those shield laws.

(Photo provided by the North Dakota Governor's Office)North Dakota technology could be of interest to producers in Australia, said the country’s Midwest diplomat, who made the first trip here in years to scout trade and investment opportunities.
Australia was North Dakota’s third-largest international buyer in 2024, behind only Canada and Mexico, according to data published by the U.S. Office of the Trade Representative. North Dakota sold the country $252 million in goods last year.
Australia is especially interested in North Dakota agriculture, defense and energy products, Chris Elstoft, Australia’s Consul-General in Chicago, said during a visit to Bismarck this week.
Uncertainty over the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign imports has “not been very helpful” in facilitating trade between the two nations, he said, though the relationship remains strong.
“We’re sitting at 10%, which is not ideal, but is not unmanageable,” said Elstoft. The United States consistently exports more goods to Australia than it imports.
Elstoft serves as Australia’s representative in 12 Midwestern states: North Dakota, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. 
Trump levies a host of new tariffs on US trading partners

His tour is facilitated by the North Dakota Trade Office. Elstoft said this is his first visit to North Dakota, though his predecessor had last visited the state four years ago. In addition to Bismarck, he plans to visit Grand Forks, Fargo and Jamestown.
Technology developed by and for North Dakota industries could be of use to producers in Australia, Elstoft said. He said North Dakota farmers sell a lot of used agricultural equipment to Australia, for example.
“Your farmers tend to like to have the newest model every two or three years,” he said. “It seems like we have a few farmers in Australia that are happy to take the harvester, or whatever it is, off their hands.”
He added that Australian companies produce technology and equipment for the oil, gas and mining sectors that North Dakota businesses could benefit from. 
Elstoft said as Australia is increasing its defense spending, it’s also becoming a major buyer of U.S. military products.
“On the defense side, we’re very comfortable and confident that that alliance between the two countries just continues to strengthen,” he said.

Maggie Goodlander signed onto a letter alongside 41 other U.S. representatives asking Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Abe Sutton, deputy administrator, to back away from a proposed change to traditional Medicare.
CMS announced in June it was adding prior authorization requirements to traditional Medicare as a pilot program. That means, for certain procedures, the federal government will partner with private companies to determine whether a patient on Medicare should receive care their doctor is requesting. The agency said it will use its “WISeR” model, a protocol officials say will allow them to root out waste, abuse, and fraud, and test artificial intelligence as a tool to expedite the prior authorizations.
Prior authorization is already a common requirement in Medicare Advantage, an alternative form of Medicare offered by government-approved private companies that eligible Americans can opt into. Prior authorization has been criticized by patients and advocates who say it creates too large of a bureaucratic burden and limits the number of providers willing to work with Medicare Advantage enrollees. A 2022 Department of Health and Human Services study shows that of the prior authorization requests that were denied, 13% should not have been.
“CMS is committed to crushing fraud, waste, and abuse, and the WISeR Model will help root out waste in Original Medicare,” Oz said in a release announcing the move. “Combining the speed of technology and the experienced clinicians, this new model helps bring Medicare into the 21st century by testing a streamlined prior authorization process, while protecting Medicare beneficiaries from being given unnecessary and often costly procedures.”
However, critics have argued the change simply keeps Medicare enrollees from receiving care they need. 
“The expansion of AI-fueled prior authorization will not improve program integrity in Traditional Medicare,” read the letter signed by Goodlander, which was also signed by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York; Becca Balint, of Vermont; and James McGovern, of Massachusetts. “Giving private for-profit actors a veto over care provided to seniors and people with disabilities in Traditional Medicare, even as a pilot program, opens the door to further erosion of our Medicare system.”
The letter continued, “While strong guardrails are important to prevent fraudulent claims and the wasteful delivery of unnecessary medical services, prior authorization, which imposes an overly steep burden on patients and providers, is a poor tool for achieving these objectives.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/goodlanderrural-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-08-05 18:56:36.966997

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minneapolis police did not violate the city’s policy barring officers from assisting in immigration enforcement during a federal raid at a Mexican restaurant in June, according to a report by the city’s independent auditor released on Tuesday.
Minneapolis police officers’ presence outside Las Cuatro Milpas on June 3 while federal agents executed a search warrant related to a narcotics and human trafficking investigation has ignited a fierce debate at City Hall over whether the city’s police force should ever assist ICE as the Trump administration pursues mass deportations.
Dozens of federal officers from ICE, FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency and other agencies arriving at the intersection of Lake Street and Bloomington Avenue with armored vehicles, assault weapons and zip-ties quickly drew hundreds protesting their presence in the largely immigrant neighborhood.
Minneapolis police officers including Chief Brian O’Hara responded to the scene to prevent civil unrest along a stretch of Lake Street that was looted and vandalized in 2020 during the protests of the police killing of George Floyd.
City Council members and immigrant advocates questioned whether the department was abiding by the city’s “separation ordinance,” which bars officers from undertaking any action for the purpose of detecting the presence of undocumented people or arresting people for violating federal civil immigration laws.
The ordinance does not bar officers from assisting federal authorities in other criminal operations, and federal authorities later said the operation was part of a series of raids at eight locations across the Twin Cities metro area following the discovery of 900 pounds of methamphetamine in a Burnsville storage locker. An ICE spokesperson said the “groundbreaking” operation was Minnesota’s first under President Donald Trump’s Homeland Security Task Force, which he established via executive order on the first day of his second term.
No one was arrested in Minneapolis as part of the raid, but Las Cuatro Milpas owner Francisco Estrada-Deltaro was later taken into custody and charged with re-entering the U.S. after being deported, the Star Tribune reported.
In his report, City Auditor Robert Timmerman said the Minneapolis Police Department did not know about the raid until just before 10 a.m. when dispatch aired an alert that Lake and Bloomington would be closed. O’Hara was notified minutes later of the presence of federal law enforcement while he was attending a roll call at the police training facility in north Minneapolis.

With scarce official communication about the raid, members of the city council and the mayor’s administration quickly began to accuse one another of spreading misinformation.
Council Member Jason Chavez, who was on the scene, was informed by MPD at 11:39 a.m. that the federal action was not immigration related. Minutes later, Chavez posted to social media saying “they” lied and ICE agents were present, according to a timeline prepared by the city auditor.
Those two facts aren’t necessarily contradictory, and the city auditor found both the mayor and the city council were truthful in their official communications.
City council members blasted the police department and mayor’s office for not officially notifying them until 1:50 p.m., nearly four hours after O’Hara learned of the action. That left council members in a “void” of information, according to the auditor, who recommended the city improve its communication practices.
The auditor’s report did little to quell the debate over the police’s cooperation with federal law enforcement.
Chavez, the son of Mexican immigrants who represents the area where the raid occurred, said ICE poses a “dangerous threat to our community” no matter the reason for their presence.
“They may be going for drug trafficking, sex trafficking, but at the end of the day, if they see our undocumented community members right there as bystanders, they have shown that they will take them as collateral damage,” Chavez said during a council meeting on Tuesday before a crowd of supporters holding signs reading “No Crowd Control” and “Real Sanctuary Now.”
Chavez along with the rest of the progressive wing of the council said the city should revise its ordinance to further restrict police coordination with ICE.
“Our community in south Minneapolis on Lake and Bloomington experienced trauma, experienced pain and an escalation by the federal government,” he added.
The ordinance is now a major issue in the race for mayor, with all candidates save Mayor Jacob Frey saying they would discipline O’Hara for his presence on the scene.
“No serious mayor would commit to disciplining Chief O’Hara for something that never happened,” Frey said at the time. “The facts are clear — it wasn’t an immigration raid, and the MPD was not involved in its execution. No chief will work for a mayor who misrepresents their conduct for political gain.”
DFL-endorsed challenger Sen. Omar Fateh said the Minneapolis police should never cooperate with ICE.
“No matter the circumstance, especially when MPD is short staffed, even helping Trump’s Federal agents do ‘crowd control’ is unconscionable. MPD should be responding to urgent calls and clearing its backlog of unsolved crimes, not doing Trump’s bidding,” Fateh said on social media the day after the raid.
Fateh said if elected he would support strengthening the separation ordinance and fire officers who violate the policy against cooperating with ICE.
Gov. Tim Walz called the enforcement action “chaotic,” though said he supports law enforcement stopping criminal activity. Attorney General Keith Ellison said it seemed the point of the heavy militarized presence “was to inflict terror and fear into the community.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0149-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-05 18:56:36.966997

Shouldn’t Massachusetts lead the way, rather than leave its citizens behind on this critical issue?  
The post Healey’s veto of funding for GLP-1 drugs harms public employees and the economy     appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ON JULY 4, Gov. Healey signed the 2026 state budget into law. Lost in the flurry of news coverage on a holiday weekend was the administration’s intention to cut public employees’ access to GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight management and the treatment of obesity.  
These drugs represent a revolutionary advance in the treatment of the disease of obesity, and they have become a life-saving medication for thousands of state employees.  
Those employees will be left without coverage for GLP-1 drugs if the governor’s veto of $27.5 million for the Group Insurance Commission, which handles employee health coverage, is allowed to stand and if the Legislature approves language she submitted in a separate budget package allowing the GIC to make changes in covered benefits midway through the health plan year. 
As the Massachusetts-based CEO of the World Obesity Federation, and on behalf of our local Massachusetts member, the Obesity Action Coalition, and over 1 million state residents living with obesity, I urge the Legislature to override the governor’s veto of funding for these life-saving therapies – and not to adopt language in the separate budget bill authorizing the benefit cut. 
The World Obesity Federation is the main partner to the World Health Organization on obesity and has member organizations in over 100 countries. We work to advance policies aimed at preventing and managing this disease that affects over 1 billion people worldwide.   
By 2035 over half of humanity is projected to have overweight and obesity, so effective treatments and policies that work cannot come quickly enough, and be made accessible to all. 
What we’ve seen in Massachusetts, where individual blame and prevention-only policies have been insufficient to address what is increasingly recognized as a complex chronic disease, is true everywhere. We can’t prevent our way out of this tsunami, nor can we just treat our way out of it. We must do both.   
The economic impact of obesity is mind-boggling. In 2022, World Obesity published a study showing that the costs of inaction on obesity, as measured by the impact of all the cases of cancer, diabetes, and other diseases that obesity is driving, is currently at over 3 percent of GDP in the United States and projected to almost double by 2060. 
There is nothing to suggest that the economic impact at the state level would be substantially different. This means that not treating obesity will lead to far higher costs associated with managing and treating diseases that could otherwise have been avoided. Treating obesity yields a double dividend in terms of the savings and societal benefits of reducing the burden of other diseases.  
It is true that the new medications are costly in the US. Costs can be reined in and rates can be negotiated, especially as some drugs go off patent. But it’s no accident that one of the groups that has been most vocal in calling for solutions that maintain coverage is employers, who see the impact and understand how much neglecting obesity harms their most valued asset.  
It is not widely known among public employees that the governor has proposed removing their coverage of GLP-1s. That means there are thousands of teachers, firefighters, police officers, maintenance workers, and other people who contribute every day to making the Commonwealth work, who are soon going to be notified that they no longer have this coverage.  
The same is true for retirees covered by the GIC. Study after study tells us that obesity often returns quickly once GLP-1s are removed, and we also know that the cycle of gaining/losing/gaining only exacerbates the progression of the disease — and the diseases caused or made worse by obesity.  
Therefore, the removal of coverage worsens the health of our public workforce, rather than just restoring the status quo. These are the people at the heart of what makes Massachusetts such a great state.  
The governor’s proposal makes an exception for those for whom the drugs are “medically necessary” a carveout that mostly refers to those with diabetes. 
This is problematic for two reasons. First, there are many other diseases that are associated with obesity that don’t seem to make the cut. Why not cancer? Sleep apnea? Musculoskeletal diseases? The list of diseases is 200 strong. Second, the diabetes that these drugs treat is driven by obesity. Why wait to treat something downstream when it can be much more effectively managed sooner?   
The only explanation seems to be the persistent stigma about obesity that has been one of the engines of its growth. Patients with obesity will, time and again, encounter misinformed health care professionals who blame or shame them for having what the American Medical Association and WHO have confirmed is a chronic disease. The governor’s unfortunate choice of words suggests the therapies are cosmetic and not medical.    
In the coming months, before the cut to state employees’ coverage is intended to take effect, the WHO will launch global GLP-1 guidelines, calling for a step change in access and affordability. It is anticipated that GLP-1s will also be included on the WHO essential medicines list, alongside medications for malaria, HIV, and, yes, diabetes. 
Shouldn’t Massachusetts lead the way, rather than leave its citizens behind on this critical issue?

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday sued Oklahoma over a state law giving undocumented immigrants access to in-state tuition and financial aid at colleges and universities. 
President Donald Trump’s administration argued that Oklahoma state law violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to find the statute invalid. 
Oklahoma Attorney Gentner Drummond, a Republican, whose office represents the state and public officials in litigation, filed a motion Tuesday in support of the lawsuit. 
Attorneys for the Department of Justice argued that the law extends eligibility for in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants while not extending that treatment to U.S. citizens in other states. 
“This unequal treatment of Americans is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law, which expressly provides that ‘an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State . . . for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident,’” the lawsuit reads. 
The lawsuit references executive orders from the Republican president, this year that “emphasize that federal and state governments must not grant greater benefits to individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States than to American citizens.”
Oklahoma is one of 23 states and Washington D.C. that provides in-state tuition and financial aid benefits to undocumented students, according to an analysis by the Higher Education Portal, which is a platform for data, resources and policy analysis regarding immigrant student populations. 
Oklahoma law allows requires in-state tuition be offered to anyone who graduates high school in the state and resides in Oklahoma for at least two years prior to graduation.
The lawsuit also argues that under the law, undocumented immigrants are eligible. Students who meet the residency requirements and provide one of Oklahoma’s colleges and universities with their application or a petition to legalize their immigration status can be eligible for  state scholarships or financial aid, according to the lawsuit. 
Angela Caddell, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, said in a statement Tuesday that the Regents are in the process of determining how many students will be impacted.
“The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education will follow federal law,” she said. “State system institutions will determine their next steps in concert with their respective campus governing boards.”
Drummond, in his motion, sided with the Trump administration and requested that the court prevent the state statute from being enforced. 
“Today marks the end of a longstanding exploitation of Oklahoma taxpayers, who for many years have subsidized colleges and universities as they provide unlawful benefits to illegal immigrants in the form of in-state tuition,” Drummond said in a statement. “Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong — it is discriminatory and unlawful.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of EnergySoaring electricity prices that have boosted residents’ utility bills likely won’t be enough to incentivize the development of new power generation that could ease the crunch, a panel of industry experts said Tuesday at a conference hosted by New Jersey’s energy regulator.
The risks borne by energy investors are still too great despite surges in wholesale electricity prices over the past two years, the experts said, especially in an uncertain regulatory environment and given the long time horizons associated with standing up new generation. Current price levels could be sufficient to encourage output upgrades at existing facilities, they added.
“I think that we have to be realistic about clearing prices continuing to ascend in order to get price signals to developers for new build,” said Richard Levitan, president of Levitan & Associates, an energy management consultancy. “We could be looking at price signals that are much, much higher — closer to $700 per megawatt-day.”
That would be more than double the clearing price PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states, reached at a capacity auction in July, where wholesale energy prices climbed to a record $329.17 per megawatt-day. That was up from $269.92 the year before, and $28.92 in the July 2023 auction.
This year’s price doesn’t fully reflect demand in the grid’s wholesale energy market. As part of a settlement with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, PJM agreed to cap clearing prices for this year’s auction at roughly $325.
The interconnector estimated capacity prices would have closed about 18% higher, at $389 per megawatt-day, without the cap.
July’s auction results are expected to raise ratepayer bills by between 1.5% and 5% in June 2026, depending on a resident’s state.
Katharine Perry, deputy director of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ resource adequacy program, said the agency expects capacity prices to be between $500 and $600 per megawatt day in next July’s auction. A result in that range could roughly double the cost of wholesale electricity.
“When the collar is removed in the not-too-distant future, we’ll be looking skyward,” Levitan said.
Those increases could be defrayed if projects queued to connect to PJM’s grid do so, even if they provide a fraction of generation on PJM’s grid. Demand effects are magnified when peak load approaches the grid’s capacity, so the addition of even relatively small generation projects can meaningfully decrease prices.
New Jersey ratepayers’ electricity bills rose by roughly 20% due to surging electricity demand in last July’s capacity auction and a separate generation auction run by the Board of Public Utilities.
Elected officials have diverged on the causes. Republicans point to Gov. Phil Murphy’s renewables-heavy energy agenda and his administration’s focus on offshore wind, which is all but dead after the Trump administration paused or withdrew permits and leases for those projects. Democrats like Murphy blame PJM for being too slow to connect some projects to its grid.
PJM, in an annual report published in June, said about 158,000 megawatts of generation were awaiting connection to its queue, including roughly 18,000 from New Jersey projects. About two-thirds of the New Jersey capacity was from offshore wind projects that are essentially defunct.
Historically, about 20% of projects queued to connect to PJM’s grid eventually do, though that number had fallen to about 7% amid delays in recent years, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of pro-renewables advocacy group MAREC Action.
Price pressures make it difficult to predict how many projects will clear the queue in the near future, he said.
Industry officials have noted there is a mismatch between supply, which has been largely static as new projects struggle to come online or existing plants are shut down, and demand that is surging to meet the energy needs of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.
The scale and suddenness of these centers’ energy demands are hard to understate, said Tim Gallagher, CEO of ReliabilityFirst, a non-governmental regulatory body tasked with ensuring electricity reliability in a region that spans from New Jersey to the Great Lakes region.
“Just to put things in perspective, some of these large AI-related data centers, they propose campuses that use between 1 and 2 gigawatts of electricity,” Gallagher said. “That’s as big or bigger electric demand as the city of San Francisco, and instead of evolving in 85 square miles over decades, you’re talking about a few hundred acres in 24 months to three years from concept to implementation.”
Expansion
Kati Austgen, director of public engagement at the Nuclear Energy Institute, on Tuesday said that uprates — upgrades that improve the output of existing facilities — require less investment than brand new infrastructure. Price signals from the capacity market could be enough to encourage those expansions, Austgen said.
“It’s really conducive to pursuing uprates, and so that’s a sign that the economic signals are working for uprate-type expansions,” she said. “We’re also seeing in PJM that it’s useful as a signal to restart some recently retired nuclear plants that were retired for economic reasons.”
She said uprates, which would typically expand nuclear or fossil capacity, could add roughly 500 megawatts of nuclear capacity to PJM’s grid by 2031.
Liam Baker, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Alpha Generation, which operates fossil plants in New Jersey and some nearby states, warned political objections could be a major barrier to uprates at fossil facilities, citing yearslong local opposition to gas plants in Kearny and Newark.
“We need to tone down the rhetoric and tone down the hostility when people mention natural gas or nuclear or even batteries,” he said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)For the first time in six weeks, striking Butler Hospital workers and management are set to formally return to the negotiating table Wednesday even as the two sides continue to wage separate campaigns to shape public perception of the longest hospital strike in state history.
The two sides last met formally June 25 to discuss the possibility of new contracts for the members of SEIU 1199 NE — the union that represents 724 workers at the Providence psychiatric hospital, including nurses, mental health workers and dietary and clerical staff. The old contracts expired on March 31.
Care New England submitted its “last, best, and final offer” on July 11, which management said included raising the wage floor for the lowest-paid workers to $18.03, about 20% above the state minimum wage — approximately a $3 per hour pay bump over prior rates. Roughly 98% of union members rejected the proposal on July 29. 
At a press event outside the hospital entrance on Blackstone Boulevard Tuesday morning on what marked the 83rd day of the strike, union members held firm. Workers took to the picket line on May 15.
“The reason that we voted to reject it is because, though there was some movement, it still left our lowest paid workers behind,” Ben Degnan, a mental health worker at the hospital, told reporters. “So dietary, housekeeping, medical records folks — they’re saying $18 an hour is enough to survive on in the state. And I think all of us know that that is not true.”
‘I voted no, passionately no.’ Butler Hospital strikers reject latest contract offer

Outside the Butler entrance on Blackstone Boulevard, amid a walking path typically busy with pedestrians and joggers, the picket line evidenced a lived-in feel.
Dunkin’ coffee and rows of doughnuts in boxes rested on a table beneath a canopy tent, and cases of bottled water and soda were stacked off to the side. Some workers chanted, walking the same loop over and over, while others sat in folding chairs in the shade across the street. Police directed traffic in and out of the long driveway leading up to the Butler campus. A row of portable toilets stood off to the side.     
But union members said that they’re not just sitting around while they’re on strike. 
Hannah Roosa, a registered nurse, said union members have been donating more than 1,400 volunteer hours over the past 12 weeks as they wait for a contract to emerge, helping with food pantries, community gardens, shoreline cleanups, and hauling wood at WaterFire.
“This isn’t charity work. This is solidarity,” Roosa said. “This is who we are as health care workers. When management locked us out, we didn’t stop caring. We never will.”
Catherine Maynard, also an RN, told reporters that the union is also donating blood. The Rhode Island Blood Center declared a blood emergency on July 21, as it has only two days’ worth of blood in its inventory, well below the seven-day benchmark for inventories. Striking Butler workers have donated enough blood to save almost 40 people, the union said.
“Last Friday, we actually sent so many members to the blood center that they had to turn us away because they couldn’t accept so many walk-ins,” Maynard said. 
Total radio ad spending tops $43,000
SEIU has one thing in common with Care New England: Radio ads.
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) documents show that the New England Health Care Union (another name for SEIU) spent a gross amount of $7,515 between May 30 and July 6 for radio ads that ran on WEAN-FM and WPRO. In total, the group purchased 70 ad spots during that timeframe. 
In one ad, mental health worker Meghan Kiernan describes how she sustained three injuries from the job: A sprained wrist, a bite to her shoulder, and a concussion from a punch to the face. 
“No one should have to choose between doing the job they love and their own safety,” Kiernan says in the ad.

The presence of workplace violence at Butler — a commonplace occurrence in psychiatric facilities, but one that has become even more common in recent years — has been a major sticking point in contract negotiations.  
Care New England, meanwhile, spent a combined $36,328.50 on a total of 351 ad spots that aired on WEAN-FM and WPRO between July 14 and Aug. 3, according to FCC filings and a confirmation from Butler spokesperson Mike Raia.
As the two sides have wrestled for public attention, they have also offered different accounts of how the negotiations process has played out, particularly in regards to the involvement of Butler’s President Mary Marran and Care New England’s CEO Michael Wagner.
Degnan, a member of the union’s bargaining committee, said Tuesday he hoped the two higher-ups would attend Wednesday’s negotiations, claiming that they have not sat at the bargaining table “once in this whole process.”
“We would like them to come and look us in the eye and bargain,” Degnan said. “I’ve never seen Michael Wagner in my life. Frankly, I’ve never met the man. I have met Mary Marran in the hospital before…I’ve seen Mary on television since we’ve been out, but not at the table, so we’re ready to see them.”
Conflicting accounts of who’s at the table
That narrative was challenged by Wagner himself in a July 31 email to his colleagues within and outside Care New England. In the email, obtained by Rhode Island Current, Wagner labels SEIU 1199 NE leadership as “professional organizers.” These union leaders have “misled their members and the public about Butler’s willingness to meet and negotiate, telling their members and the media that we have not sat at the table,” according to Wagner.  
“That’s simply not true,” Wagner wrote. “I have personally met with members of SEIU’s negotiating team and/or with SEIU 1199NE President Rob Baril no fewer than four times since the start of July. Butler’s President and COO Mary Marran has joined me for three of those meetings.”










I’ve never seen Michael Wagner in my life. Frankly, I’ve never met the man.

Both parties agreed “to keep the contents of those discussions off the record in hopes of reaching agreement,” Wagner said, leading him to feel “increasingly alarmed, frustrated, and disappointed that SEIU would make false claims that we have not made ourselves available.”
Spokesperson Raia reiterated in a Tuesday email that Wagner and Marran “have been at several negotiating sessions with union leaders…The hospital’s bargaining team has authority to reach agreement on behalf of Butler.”
“At the union’s request, Butler Hospital’s negotiating team has agreed to meet tomorrow with SEIU’s negotiating committee,” Raia added. “We are hopeful that SEIU 1199NE will come to that table in good faith.”
In his email, Wagner also took aim at the state labor department’s ruling that Butler workers have been locked out and are therefore eligible for unemployment insurance. Butler appealed the agency ruling in the state’s Supreme Court, and the case is pending a hearing in early September. Wagner wondered, however, how much the unemployment money is costing the state, and whether strikers are receiving strike pay from the union. 
“Benefits are currently being paid from the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund, which Butler will reimburse,” said Department of Labor and Training spokesperson Edwine Paul in an email Tuesday. “However, because Unemployment Insurance information is privileged by law, I am unable to provide additional comment at this time.”
A major sticking point of the union’s continued refusals of management’s offers involves solidarity with the lowest-paid workers, Degnan said outside the hospital Tuesday. 
“There is no division between departments and job classifications, between any of us,” Degnan said. “We are united…and we’re ready to go back as soon as the hospital recognizes all of our work.”
In his July 31 email, Wagner described the “last, best, and final” contract offer as a “significant” movement from the hospital’s starting block, and that management has “address[ed] items identified by SEIU as important” with each iteration of the proposal.
Wagner disputed SEIU’s claims of “poverty wages” by noting the lowest-paid employees — about 55 of the 724 union members — would earn $18.03 an hour under the deal.

BURLINGTON — A former U.S. Border Patrol agent has pleaded guilty to a federal charge of possessing child sexual abuse material and faces up to 30 months in prison. 
Joshua Hartness, 45, of Colebrook, New Hampshire, entered his guilty plea to the felony charge Tuesday in federal court in Burlington. 
As part of a plea deal, prosecutors agreed to cap their prison sentence request at 30 months. His attorney will be permitted to argue for a lesser prison term. Hartness would also be required to register as a sex offender upon his release.  
Judge Christina Reiss held off Tuesday on accepting the plea deal until after federal probation officers complete a presentence report. She set a sentencing hearing for Nov. 24.

Reiss said she will decide whether the maximum sentence allowed under the plea deal is appropriate after reading the presentence report. Should she determine that it isn’t, the judge told Hartness he could withdraw his guilty plea and the case could proceed to a trial or other resolution.
Hartness was arrested in December on a charge of possessing child sexual abuse material between May 22, 2022, and Aug. 26, 2022. On Sept. 11, 2022, his cellphone was inspected at Logan International Airport in Boston as he was returning to the United States from abroad, according to court records. 
That inspection revealed potential child sexual abuse material leading to further investigation of his cellphone, court records stated. 
It is not clear from charging documents what prompted investigators to inspect his cellphone upon his arrival at the Boston airport. 
Hartness was arraigned in December and was released on conditions after pleading not guilty. At the time of his arrest, Hartness was working for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection as a border agent in northern Vermont. He no longer works for the federal law enforcement agency.
In March, Hartness was back in court and ordered jailed for allegedly violating the conditions of release by trying to obtain firearms. 
Hartness attempted to get a “commemorative lever-action rifle,” a “fully operable” firearm designed to mark the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Border Patrol, according to court records.
Hartness was returned to the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans on Tuesday following his court hearing.

Mike Braun was careful in his comments Tuesday about potential redistricting in Indiana to net a GOP seat — or two — in Congress. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As President Donald Trump looks to increase the Republican majority in Congress, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun confirmed on Tuesday that Vice President JD Vance will be coming to Indianapolis to likely make a personal redistricting appeal.
“Whatever we discuss there, and if that topic comes up, it’s exploratory,” Braun said. “There’s been no commitments made.”
The visit is part of a nationwide push to net more Republican seats in the historically narrow U.S. House of Representatives — most notably in Texas, where Trump has said the GOP is “entitled” to more seats in Congress. 
Indiana redraws congressional boundaries every 10 years after new census numbers, and has never done so off-cycle. Leaders will also have to determine if it’s legally allowed.
Mentioning Texas, Braun said that redistricting outside of the traditional ten-year cycle is “not going to be a calm process,” adding that, “we’ll see what happens.”
  Indiana Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, pans any explicitly partisan redistricting efforts at the Indiana Statehouse on Aug. 5, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But Indiana Rep. Matt Pierce warned against the idea of redistricting with the explicit aim to grow a partisan advantage, worrying that such an effort can “take us down a very bad path.
“Because after that happens, our congressional institution is going to be illegitimate. People are going to ask themselves, ‘Does this really reflect the will of the people?’” asked Pierce, a Democrat from Bloomington. “… Once you lose legitimacy as a government, you don’t have a democracy anymore. This is no small thing that’s happening here — this is basically a knife fight for democracy and the Democrats better act like it.”
In retaliation, some Democrat-led states have floated the possibility of redrawing their maps to net more seats in Congress for their party, namely California and New York. Both of those states would have to reckon with state laws that put redistricting in the hands of non-partisan commissions, however. 
States like Illinois and Texas already have an “F” from the Gerrymandering Project’s report card for their redistricting process. Indiana, meanwhile, has an “A” grade for its congressional map.
The number of competitive seats in Congress has dwindled. Theoretically, any candidate could win in the U.S. House’s 435 seats but, realistically, only 18 seats are considered to be a “toss up.” Senate positions are selected by the entire state and, as such, will not be impacted by redistricting. 
“There are not a whole lot of seats in the House of Representatives that really could swing towards one party or the other,” said Steven Webster, an associate professor of political science at Indiana University’s Bloomington campus. “The reality is that most seats are pretty safe for one party; and so a lot of times you kind of have a pretty close balance of power in the House.”
Tip O’Neill, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, once famously said “all politics is local,” though he didn’t originate the sentiment. 
Webster, however, said that “increasingly, the opposite is true.” 
“These are ostensibly state-level issues, but they’re reflecting these national political debates,” he continued.
 Congressional maps in Indiana

Indiana has nine congressional districts. Two are held by Democrats, while all of the Republican districts are considered to be safely and reliably red. Of the Democratic seats, one includes two-thirds of Marion County and would be difficult to redraw without diluting GOP voting margins in surrounding districts.
But the seat in northwestern Indiana, held by U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan since 2021, has been a Republican target in the past and is Indiana’s most competitive seat. Mrvan held onto the seat in 2022 with nearly 53% of the vote against Republican Jennifer-Ruth Green, who is now the state’s secretary of public safety. That margin grew slightly — to just over 53% — in 2024, when Mrvan won over Republican Randy Niemeyer.

And with parties scrambling to get any seat possible, Webster said that the Mrvan’s district is “the obvious target.” 
Pierce, the House Democrat, said even Texas had to grapple with concerns that by redistricting in an explicitly partisan manner, they might accidentally create new districts that were actually competitive. 
“In the era of artificial intelligence and data and thousands of data points about every voter, you can really gerrymander with precision,” said Pierce. “… so my concern is that this technology will allow them to accomplish their goals.” 
Braun seemed to be hesitant about the prospect, repeatedly referring to other states with so-called gerrymandered maps that have districts “where it looks like the tentacles of an octopus.” Though both major parties are guilty of gerrymandering for political gain, he pointedly referred to Democrat-controlled Illinois and even Indiana’s own legislative maps in the early 2000s, when Democrats led the state. 
“I think it’s a little rich, in the sense that they’re making that kind of case about it,” he said. “… gerrymandering has been their specialty, not ours.”
It’s unclear if state law would allow legislators to move forward with redistricting. A 1995 non-binding opinion from the Attorney General’s Office found that lawmakers could not redistrict state House and Senate seats mid-cycle but didn’t address congressional. 
“Here, the text, history, and caselaw surrounding the pertinent constitutional provisions point unerringly to the same conclusion: attempts to redistrict in a manner other than that specified in Article 4, section 5 of the Indiana Constitution are forbidden.”
Additionally, Pierce noted, that ruling only specifies the timing of drawing up legislative maps — not those for Congress.
 
Indiana Constitution Article 5, Section 4: The General Assembly elected during the year in which a federal decennial census is taken shall fix by law the number of Senators and Representatives and apportion them among districts according to the number of inhabitants in each district, as revealed by that federal decennial census. The territory in each district shall be contiguous.

“I think President Trump and his handlers know that his popularity is declining; and I think they feel a wave coming; and they’re willing to do anything to thwart the will of the people,” said Pierce. 
But with states like California and New York threatening to counter potential Texan gains, political operatives are looking to see where else maps could be redrawn — a process that Pierce decried. 
He called for nonpartisan commissions in every state, a movement that has failed to gather enough momentum at the Indiana Statehouse — but said Democrats couldn’t “unilaterally disarm” in the current environment. 
“This is a knife fight for democracy, and we have to get in there, and we have to fight hard,” Pierce said. “If that means trying to counterbalance these illegitimate moves on the parts of Republicans to try to redraw these maps in the middle of the decade, then we’ve got to try to counterbalance that.”
“If we just sit back and let this happen and we end up with an illegitimate Congress — really, our democracy is hanging by a thread and, at that point, then maybe it’s even over,” he continued. “So we have to fight hard to try to prevent this from happening.”
 Can they do that?

If the Republican supermajority decides to move forward it would require a special session. 
Braun would have to call it, but House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate Majority Leader Rodric Bray would set the agenda. Neither Huston nor Bray responded to a request for comment.
The two-week special session in 2022 cost taxpayers $240,000, which went to lawmakers’ per diems and travel expenses. However, that session came during a time when Indiana’s coffers were overflowing — as opposed to today, when the state is laying off workers and cutting expenses. 
When asked about the cost, Braun declined to “make any pre-statement on that,” but said he and legislative leaders will listen to pitches from those interested in redistricting.

Webster called the idea politically “plausible,” saying that “if a special session is called, I would not be terribly surprised.
“I think this is a trend that’s likely to extend beyond just Texas or Indiana,” he added. 
Barring a special session, lawmakers aren’t expected to consider new laws until January — when candidates will start filing to run for a seat in Congress. 
“I think it’s all going to come down, as most things in politics do, to how things get framed,” said Webster. 
An “enterprising politician” could attempt to frame it in a way that takes away from any criticism about the cost, he said, though Democrats would be likely to highlight that budget hit. 
“Whether that will be sufficient to stop Republicans from doing it is another question,” Webster concluded.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The state’s Attorney General said Tuesday that he is frustrated that an investigative audit of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority that he requested more than two years ago hasn’t been completed.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the state’s auditor and inspector needs to finalize the audit, which he first requested in March 2023, so he can take any appropriate action.
“While I certainly understand the need for a thorough and detailed review, I am not aware of any other instance in the history of our state when an investigative audit required more than two years to complete,” he said.
In a March 15, 2023, letter to Byrd requesting the audit, Drummond wrote that his concerns include improper transfers between OTA and the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, improper contracting and purchasing, and inadequate internal financial controls.
In response to Drummond’s criticism, Byrd said Tuesday an audit of this size and scope has never been done on OTA.
She said when her office got the request, she announced it would be a year before she could get started because the office was already auditing billions in COVID-19 pandemic spending.
The agency’s work was further delayed when it was called upon to look at financial problems at the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Byrd said.
She said Drummond was notified that special audits were temporarily suspended due to that and agreed.
Drummond could better serve Oklahomans by actually facilitating prosecutions based on her office’s findings in previous investigations, Byrd said.
Joe Echelle, OTA executive director, also addressed  the ongoing audit Tuesday at his governing board’s regular monthly meeting. The state Auditor and Inspector has never audited the OTA before, he said.
“We are audited by a lot of different organizations all the time,” said Dana Weber, an OTA board member. “So, it is not like this is our first audit, it is just the first audit of this type.”
Echelle said the agency is paying $150,000 for the audit, which is not necessary and redundant.
He said OTA is audited by a third-party auditor every year and undergoes financial scrutiny from various entities because it sells bonds.
The agency’s internal auditor also reports its findings, Echelle said.
Auditors are also looking at how the agency bids projects and selects consultants, Echelle said.
He said there was no due date on the audit.
Echelle said the Legislative Office of Fiscal  Transparency is also expected to file its own report of OTA in a month or two. 
That probe is looking at how much OTA owes in outstanding bonds and if a route exists for the Legislature to pay off the bonds, Echelle said.
OTA has slightly more than $3 billion in outstanding bonds, said Lisa Shearer-Salim, a spokeswoman.
The agency sells bonds to build and improve turnpikes. It uses toll revenue to pay off the bonds.

Julie Brixie (D-Meridian Township) is taking the House’s Republican Leadership to task following an announcement that schools in her district would no longer be providing free meals to all students. 
In a letter to parents on Monday, Okemos Public Schools announced they would need to charge for school meals, at least for the beginning of the upcoming school year due to a delay in state funding. 
The letter explains that free meals are funded through a state program but without a budget for this school year, that funding is not guaranteed. 
Shannon Beczkiewicz, the communications coordinator for Okemos Public Schools told the Michigan Advance in an email that the uncertainty over state funding has caused challenges for schools in planning their own budgets. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Until schools have that information, they are adapting just in case past categorical funding is eliminated. If the state does restore the free meals for all students program, Okemos will be excited to provide that,” Beczkiewicz said.
In response, Brixie noted that House Democrats had successfully passed their budgets while in charge of the chamber in 2023 and 2024, faulting Republicans for placing schools on uncertain footing in regards to funding. 
“It is clear that Republicans are more interested in playing politics than ensuring kids have food to eat while they’re at school. They are making one thing loud and clear: they’re okay with hungry kids. I’m not okay with that, and I will continue to fight for our community and a school budget that puts our kids first and makes sure no kid has to learn on an empty stomach,” Brixie said in a press release. 
In response, House Republicans hit back at the Democratic-led Senate. 
“House Republicans passed a responsible budget for our schools more than a month ago, putting students and families first. We worked alongside Gov. Whitmer on finding a bipartisan deal right up until the July 1 deadline when the Senate decided to pack up and go home,” Rep. Ken Borton (R-Gaylord), a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on School Aid and Department of Education, said in a statement. 
“Democrats over in the Senate are addicted to pork-barrel earmarks like a thirteen-year-old is to using their cellphone in class. They need to drop the act and start putting our kids first so we can deliver the resources Michigan schools and communities deserve,” Borton said.
While Borton pointed to legislative spending initiatives as the snag in budget negotiations, Senate Democrats have laid the blame squarely at the feet of Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (D-Richland Township). Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) told reporters on the day of the budget deadline that if he and his House counterpart Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township) were given free rein to negotiate, they’d have something together pretty quickly.

“Michigan’s schools have suffered from decades of neglect from previous Republican majorities, resulting in underfunded mental health support, staff shortages, and unsafe conditions.” Camilleri told the Advance on Tuesday. “And now, some kids are literally going to go hungry at school again because Republicans are trying to completely defund the school meals program. They’re creating uncertainty and chaos for our students, parents, and teachers all because they care more about getting their way than doing their damn jobs.”
Camilleri said that Democrats were interested in passing a good budget and noted that the Senate plan had been praised by parents and school groups alike.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s new academic standards for social studies are poised to take effect for the coming school year, as the state Supreme Court this week declined to pause their implementation.
A group of 33 parents, faith leaders and teachers filed a lawsuit July 1 against state Superintendent Ryan Walters and the Oklahoma State Board of Education, asking the Court to block the new standards, which dictate what topics public schools must teach to students. 
The plaintiffs contend the new pro-Bible standards will violate religious freedoms by imposing Christian beliefs on students and that the state Board of Education failed to uphold proper procedures when approving them.
The Court on Monday declined to apply a temporary pause to the new standards. The justices gave no explanation in doing so. This means the standards can take effect while the lawsuit is still pending.
Attorneys representing both sides of the case gave oral arguments last week to a Supreme Court referee, who asks questions and compiles a report for the justices to review.
The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the national organization Americans United for Separation of Church and State and a local advocacy group, the Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.
The Court’s decision is “disappointing” but not the resolution of the case, said Alex Luchenitser, associate vice president and associate legal director at Americans United.
“We have presented a strong case to the court that Walters’ new standards will violate students’ and families’ religious freedom by promoting one version of Christianity and advancing Christian Nationalist disinformation,” Luchenitser said in a statement. “We’re hopeful for a final ruling in favor of our clients that protects religious freedom, public education and church-state separation for all Oklahomans.”
In a statement Tuesday, Walters said the decision is a “huge win for hardworking Oklahoma families who hold American principals dear.”
“It’s no secret, Christianity is under attack by the Left,” he said. “Under my watch, their America-hating, Christian-hating agenda will never get near a single student in an Oklahoma classroom.”
Walters’ administration developed the new standards, which the state Board of Education approved and the Oklahoma Legislature permitted to take effect.
Under the new standards, students will begin learning in second grade about biblical stories and the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth “that influenced the American colonists, founders and culture.” Fifth and eighth graders will be taught the Judeo-Christian values of the American colonists.
High-school standards generated significant controversy over new language that suggests there were “discrepancies” in the results of the 2020 presidential election, such as “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.” 
The standards also claim the origin of COVID-19 was a Chinese laboratory.
Both claims had been added to the standards without Walters and his staff acknowledging or drawing attention to it. Half of the sitting state Board of Education members said they weren’t aware the language had been added until after they voted to approve the standards.
The plaintiffs contend both the 2020 election and COVID-19 standards present inaccurate and politically motivated claims.
A similar but separate lawsuit is pending before the state Supreme Court. Another group of Oklahoma parents, grandparents and educators represented by former Attorney General Mike Hunter have asked the Court to overturn the new standards on procedural grounds.

Article Summary

Jay Doherty, a longtime lobbyist and consultant for electric utility Commonwealth Edison, has been sentenced to a year in prison for his role in a bribery scheme aimed at former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan.
Doherty and his “ComEd Four” co-defendants were convicted in 2023 for their roles in the conspiracy, and Doherty was the last to be sentenced.
While Madigan and others are pursuing appeals in their related cases, the former lobbyist gave an apology to the judge Tuesday.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO — Longtime Chicago lobbyist Jay Doherty was sentenced Tuesday to a year and a day in prison for his role in a yearslong bribery scheme between his biggest client, electric utility Commonwealth Edison, and former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan.
For eight years, Doherty agreed to use his consulting company as a pass-through in order to pay several political allies of Madigan’s, who did nothing for ComEd but received monthly checks ranging from $4,000 to $5,000. Two separate juries have found the payments were the cornerstone of a larger bribery scheme aimed at influencing Madigan while the utility pushed for major legislation in Springfield.
Before U.S. District Judge Manish Shah handed down his sentence Tuesday morning, Doherty told the judge he was “deeply ashamed” that he hadn’t recognized how far he’d strayed from the values of public service that led him to a career in government affairs. Doherty had spent decades heading up the influential City Club of Chicago and said he prided himself on connecting people, though acknowledged that some might call it “gladhanding.”
“Sometime over the years, instead of seeing my job as a means of service, it became simply a way to make more money and to build myself up,” Doherty said as he addressed Shah from a lectern in front of the courtroom. “To gain and not give. … My focus centered on how I could be the big man on campus and make money.”
Doherty’s contract swelled with each new Madigan-allied subcontractor, including monthly boosts of $1,000 to $1,500 three of the four times a man was added, which totaled roughly $220,000 in extra payments from 2011 to 2016.

The former lobbyist is the final of the “ComEd Four” to be sentenced after a series of hearings last month. Shah on Tuesday said Doherty was the least culpable of the group, but said his crimes were still serious enough to warrant incarceration.
“Behind the scenes, you played a criminal game that undermines all that the soft power that persuasion, organization and debate is meant to achieve, how civic, lawful democracy is supposed to work.” the judge said. “You cheated the very thing you put a face to at the City Club of Chicago.”
The ComEd Four were convicted in 2023 after a six-week trial featuring hundreds of wiretapped phone calls and several secretly recorded videos. In one of those tapes, ComEd executive-turned-FBI mole Fidel Marquez asked Doherty what the subcontractors were doing for him.
“Not much,” Doherty answered, adding that he rarely even spoke with the subcontractors but “they keep their mouth shut.”

Later in the meeting, Doherty told Marquez that it’s “worth it” to “keep Mike Madigan happy.”
“No. 1: Your money comes from Springfield,” Doherty said of ComEd, referring to the state’s regulatory process for approving utility rates. “… My bottom line advice would be, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it with those guys.”
Sentencings for Doherty and his co-defendants were put on hold for more than two years, delayed by concerns of possible impact from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the death of the original judge who oversaw their case, and Madigan’s own lengthy trial. The former speaker was convicted on 10 corruption charges in February and sentenced to 7 ½ years in prison earlier this summer.

The ComEd Four received across-the-board guilty verdicts after their 2023 trial, but Shah earlier this year tossed the convictions on most of the bribery counts, only leaving in place an overarching conspiracy charge. Their sentences are based on that count, as well as charges involving having falsified ComEd’s books and records in the co-conspirators’ efforts to further the bribery scheme.

Prosecutors won’t pursue a retrial on the bribery charges as Shah has granted dismissal of those counts after each sentencing, though the judge has told each defendant that he still believed they’d engaged in bribery.
Doherty’s attorney Gabrielle Sansonetti told Shah on Tuesday that her client’s “desire to go to trial” isn’t a deficiency of his character, but rather a “lack of clarity” on what defines bribery in federal statute.
“He fought because the law is unclear, not because he’s thumbing his nose at the law,” she said. “But he stands here today remorseful, nonetheless.”
Both Madigan and Doherty’s co-defendant, former ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, have already filed appeals in their related cases and plan to use ambiguity in federal bribery law as the basis for their arguments.
Pramaggiore received a two-year sentence last month, as did longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, who spent decades as Madigan’s close friend and advisor. Former ComEd executive John Hooker received 18 months in prison.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Streicker, who  also helped prosecute Madigan’s case, had argued for a 15-month sentence, which was significantly lower than the recommendations the government had made for the others before Shah handed down the other sentences last month. She said Doherty showed a willingness to “abuse” his contract with ComEd and position of trust at the “peak of his career as a lobbyist.”
The judge agreed with the government’s arguments that probation would not be enough to accomplish deterrence for others who may want to influence lawmakers to pass public policy in Springfield.
“Once people think government and public policy is a game, is a sport, they forget that the rules, the law, exist for a larger reason,” Shah said. “The law’s not just something to work around to score points in a game.”
Doherty is scheduled to report to prison on Sept. 30. The judge said he did not impose a fine as Doherty has a “negative net worth” and would be unable to pay.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is mobilizing the National Guard to help federal agents with President Donald Trump’s mass deportations.
Responding to questions from the Tennessee Lookout, the Governor’s Office restated Tuesday what Lee has said several times, “Tennessee stands ready to support President Trump’s efforts to secure our nation’s borders and remove the most violent criminals from our streets.”
Acting on a request for assistance from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the governor authorized National Guard troops to assist with administrative and clerical duties at Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facilities in Tennessee. Guard members, working under the governor’s orders but being paid by the federal government, will help ICE with data entry, case management and logistical support, according to the governor’s spokesperson, Elizabeth Johnson.
The mission is in the planning stage, and the Guard will work with state and federal agencies to decide how to respond to the request, according to Johnson.
Key Republican leaders in state government have supported the president’s deportation moves from the outset, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally of Oak Ridge.
“I absolutely agree with the use of National Guard personnel for the purpose of providing administrative and logistical support for ICE as they enforce immigration law. Our laws have been ignored and our border has been overrun for too long. Tennessee stands ready to support President Trump’s efforts to restore order to the border in any way it can,” McNally said in a statement to the Lookout.
Lee has made no secret of his plans to use state personnel to back Trump’s deportation of millions of immigrants. But while the governor mentioned aiding with the removal of violent criminals, Trump hasn’t limited deportation to those accused of serious crimes.
The governor asked state agencies to start preparing for deportation efforts on the first day of Trump’s second presidential term in January.
Tennessee is reported to be one of 20 states whose Republican governors agreed to assist ICE with deportation tasks such as paperwork. But National Public Radio reported the Department of Homeland Security is considering using National Guard troops for detention and transportation of immigrants as well as finding “fugitives.”
Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville criticized the move Tuesday, saying Congress set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security, including $75 million for ICE. He questioned why Tennessee taxpayers should help with deployment. 
“Also, if Gov. Lee wants to ‘play Army’ and mobilize the National Guard, he should have it deliver food and aid packages to the children across Tennessee who he intentionally refused to feed this summer,” Clemmons said.
Lee declined to include the state in a federally-funded summer food program, turning down an estimated $75 million that affected about 700,000 children and opting for a $3 million state-run program for fewer kids.

,DC,2025-08-05 21:15:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump illegally froze 1,800 NIH medical research grants, Congress’ watchdog says",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-illegally-froze-1800-nih-medical-research-grants-congress-watchdog-says,,"President Donald Trump’s freeze on $8 billion of congressionally appropriated funding to the National Institutes of Health was illegal, the Government Accountability Office reported Tuesday.Orders Trump signed in the early days of his return to office and related administration directives violated the Impoundment Control Act by failing to spend money that Congress, which holds the power of the purse under the Constitution, had approved, the GAO report said.Roughly 1,800 grants for health research were held up by the administration, the report said.Trump’s Inauguration Day order ceased funding for a variety of health research grants that related to diversity, equity and inclusion, transgender issues or environmental harms. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a memo directing its agencies, including NIH, to cease publishing notices in the Federal Register of meetings of grant review boards.GAO, an independent investigatory agency that reports to Congress, called those meetings “a key step in NIH’s grant review process.” HHS has since restarted notices of the meetings.From February to June, the NIH released $8 billion less than it obligated in the past two years, representing a drop-off of more than one-third, according to the GAO. The gap between 2025 spending and that of previous years continued to grow, GAO said, with NIH obligating a lower amount of grant funding each month.Illegal impoundmentThe failure to fund grant awards violated the Impoundment Control Act and the Constitution, which certified Congress as the branch of government responsible for funding decisions, said GAO.If a law is passed by Congress and signed by a president, it must be carried out by the executive branch, the watchdog said.“The President must ‘faithfully execute’ the law as Congress enacts it,” the report said. “Once enacted, an appropriation is a law like any other, and the President must implement it by ensuring that appropriated funds are obligated and expended prudently during their period of availability unless and until Congress enacts another law providing otherwise. … The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.”There are specific circumstances that allow for a funding freeze — a rescissions law, such as the one Congress passed last month to defund public broadcasters and foreign aid, is one example — but they did not apply to this case, the GAO said.Delays may be permissible to allow a new presidential administration to ensure grants are awarded based on its priorities. But a complete block on funding is illegal, the GAO said. There is no evidence that other grant awards — or any other type of funding at HHS — took the place of the $8 billion in unspent grant money, the report said.“While it can be argued that NIH reviewed grants to ensure that funds were spent in alignment with the priorities of the new administration, NIH did not simply delay the planned obligations of the funds,” the GAO said. “Rather, NIH eliminated obligations entirely by terminating grants it had already awarded.”GAO can sue the executive branch based on its findings. The report noted there is already litigation from other parties over the frozen grants.Dems call for reinstatementCongressional Democrats responded to the report by harshly criticizing Trump and White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and calling for the funds’ release.“This is simple – Congress passed and the President signed into law investments in NIH research to help find cures and treatments for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, diabetes, mental health issues, and maternal mortality,” U.S. House Appropriations Committee ranking Democrat Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said in a statement. “But now, GAO has determined that President Trump and OMB Director Vought illegally withheld billions in funding for research on diseases affecting millions of American families—research that brings hope to countless people suffering.”Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said in a statement the funding freeze “dangerously set back” efforts to cure cancer, Alzheimer’s and other diseases.“Today’s decision affirms what we’ve known for months: President Trump is illegally blocking funding for medical research and shredding the hopes of patients across the country who are counting on NIH-backed research to propel new treatments and cures that could save their lives,” Murray said. “It is critical President Trump reverse course, stop decimating the NIH, and get every last bit of this funding out.”An HHS spokesperson deferred a request for comment Tuesday to OMB.An agency investigated by the GAO is generally given a draft of the watchdog’s findings and asked to respond.The HHS response, obtained by States Newsroom, said grant reviews were back on schedule, though it did not address grant obligations.“Despite the short delay in scheduling and holding peer review and advisory council meetings to allow for the administration transition, NIH has been on pace with its reviewing grant applications and holding meetings and has caught up from the pause when compared to prior years,” the response said.GAO’s summary of the HHS response said the department had restarted meetings of grant review boards and provided some “factual information” but did not justify the lack of grant spending or provide current status of payments for previously approved grants.",,,,2025-08-05 17:56:42.263467

It was just two nights earlier that five young men allegedly engaged in a shootout on her street which left one injured, shattered car windows and left bullets lodged in homes. 
“I don’t want to move to Madison. I don’t want to move to Ridgeland. I want to stay right here in Jackson,” Martin-Davis said to a round of passionate claps. “I’ll be doggone if they make me move. This is home for me. You’re not going to mess with my folks.”
Martin-Davis has lived in Will-O-Wood for 36 years. In recent years, she said she’s seen her neighborhood become overrun with crime and gang activity. She’s called the police multiple times and left complaints with an operator about young men walking the streets with guns. 
“We’ve been dealing with this for five years. We see the boys come outside shooting the guns in the air. They’re shooting at each other like they’ve got cap guns, like the guns aren’t real,” Martin-Davis said in an interview with Mississippi Today.
On Monday evening, dozens of concerned residents packed out the community center to hear from Chief Joseph Wade with the Jackson Police Department, Chief Bo Luckey of  Capitol Police, and other elected officials, and offer their concerns about crime in their neighborhoods. 
Some voiced complaints about long wait times when calling 911. Assistant Chief of Police Vincent Grizell, who oversees the 911 system, said that JPD received over 8,000 calls last week.
“We’re hoping that things can be more efficient. We’re talking to Hinds County and AT&T about our 911 system,” Wade said. 
Officers offered up their personal phone numbers to residents to call if they needed assistance. Wade also laid out plans to increase police presence in the community.
“Not only are we looking at installing some blue light surveillance like we did in Presidential Hills. We’re looking at installing some license plate readers in your community, as well, to catch these bad actors coming in and out, and taking photos of them as they come in and out,” Wade said. “We’re also looking at installing some of our stealth covert cameras where they don’t even know that we’re there and recording things.”
Jackson Mayor John Horhn also spoke to the crowd, pointing to recent statistics that show the murder rates are declining across the city.
“All of our stats right now are trending downward in Jackson,” Horhn said. “We had 71 murders this time a year ago. We have 35 now. So we’re moving in the right direction, but not fast enough.”
Violent crime in Jackson is down 12.35% from 2024 to 2025, and property crime is down 17.28% in that same time frame, according to data provided by Tommie Brown, JPD’s public information officer.
Still, Horhn said that the court systems need to apply a bit more pressure in trying criminal cases. Some cases take years, he said, which bogs down the system.
“We’ve got to move those cases forward, and we’ve got to go ahead and expedite the building of this new jail, but I’m talking it might be 2029,” he said. 
Horhn also points to creating and investing in mentorship programs and workforce development programs as an alternative for people who are vulnerable to gang activity.
“We’re not going to police and jail our way out of this problem. We don’t have enough jails. We don’t have enough policemen to fight the problem everywhere it’s manifesting and showing its face. So we’ve got to come up with some opportunity to provide an alternative to the criminal element,” he said.
Outside after the community meeting, Martin-Davis said she’s hopeful that the police will work together with community members to protect their neighborhoods. She doesn’t want to leave Jackson, and she said she shouldn’t have to.
“I could have moved anywhere. I came back home. This is home for me. We’ve had a house over here for 36 years,” she said. “There is no way anyone is going to make me leave my neighborhood.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03143348/Chief-Wade-at-Stewpot-4.jpg,,,2025-08-05 17:56:42.263467

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is suing companies that operate porn websites for noncompliance with the state’s new age verification law, which kicked in at the start of the year.
While some well-known sites pulled down their content to users inside Florida, others have continued to operate without requiring users to verify their age, including XVideos.com which reportedly has millions of visitors from Florida. 
Uthmeier on Tuesday filed a civil lawsuit against Webgroup Czech Republic, NKL Associates, Sonesta Technologies Inc., GGW Group, and Traffic F for allegedly breaking state law and endangering minors. Many of the companies are based in the Czech Republic but several maintain Florida offices.
Uthmeier is asking the court to temporarily and permanently enjoin the companies to prevent future violations of the law and is seeking civil penalties, attorney’s fees and costs, and punitive damages. 
He wants the judge to issue an order requiring the companies to divest ownership of the domain names XVideos.com, XNXX.com (which are free to access), and GirlsGoneWild.com. 
“Multiple porn companies are flagrantly breaking Florida’s age verification law by exposing children to harmful, explicit content. As a father of young children, and as Attorney General, this is completely unacceptable,” Uthmeier said in a prepared statement. “We are taking legal action against these online pornographers who are willfully preying on the innocence of children for their financial gain.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Deceptive trade practices
Each knowing and intentional violation of Florida’s age-verification law constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice. The AG’s office notes that each violation is subject to a $50,000 penalty.
Uthmeier’s office wrote letters to two companies, WebGroup and NKL, on April 10, demanding they come into compliance with the law within 30 days, according to the suit. The letters warned there would be sanctions if they didn’t comply.
But no changes were made, the attorneys said.
“Each day that the pornographers continue to violate Florida’s age-verification law, they rack up tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of violations of these provisions and of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,”  the suit says. “Motivated by greed, the Pornographers willfully prey on the children and adolescents of Florida to the detriment of their health and well-being.”
The Florida Legislature passed HB 3 in 2024, joining scores of other states that required age verification for porn sites. Two lawsuits have been filed against the law. But a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a similar Texas law brought the legal challenges against HB 3 to an end.
According to the suit, the website XVideos.com is the 20th most popular website in the world with 1.228 billion monthly visitors, of which they estimate 18 million visits a month come from Florida.
XNXX.com is the 30th most popular website in the world with an estimated 16 million visits from Florida a month. 
GirlsGoneWild.com has more than 353,000 monthly visitors, of which approximately 9,200 are from Florida a month.

A $2M state grant will help.","With unprecedented levels of food insecurity in Torrington, elected officials joined the Friendly Hands Food Bank on Tuesday to celebrate the renovation of a much larger new site, funded with a $2 million state grant.
Torrington is one of many communities across Connecticut whose residents have seen a dramatic rise in the need for supplemental food since the COVID-19 pandemic. But Friendly Hands in Torrington has been housed in a small residential building, making it challenging to keep up with the more than 11,000 people the pantry now feeds each month.
“I’m incredibly grateful for the state’s recognition that the Northwest corner maybe needs a little help. We need to set aside our pride,” said Torrington Mayor Elinore Carbone at the press conference on Tuesday.
Gov. Ned Lamont said that his administration is doing what it can to fill the gap left as the federal government cuts its supplemental food programs and puts more pressure on states.
“The state is stepping in and doing a little bit more, but we can’t make up the energy and passion and hope and resources” needed to make this real, he said.
The new site is the former site of a local gym, with nearly 12,000 square feet of space. That’s enough to accommodate a grocery store-style shopping experience, second-hand clothing, a space for veterans to relax and cook together, laundry and shower facilities and ample food storage. The area where clients will choose their food items is as big as the entire footprint of the current pantry, storage and all.

Connecticut allocated significantly more money for food assistance this year, but the funds celebrated on Tuesday are not a part of that funding. Rather, the new pantry’s funding comes from a grant approved by the state bond commission in 2023.
The pantry won’t be receiving more food from the state thanks to the grant, but it will be able to harness its storage capacity to get more food, according to Director Karen Thomas. That’s because pantries like Friendly Hands often receive offers from truck drivers to unload pallets of food, like blemished fruit rejected from grocery stores, but without a loading dock, pantries sometimes have to refuse or are unable to store the items.
These days, Thomas puts out calls on social media to announce when a stray truckload of perishable food is available. Need in the region is so ferocious that she can unload pallets of frozen meat, for example, in a couple of hours. 
Despite not being a social media guru, Thomas said, she’s amassed an enormous following on the group’s Facebook page: 182,088 views in the past 28 days.
“Who follows a freaking food bank page? Nobody,” Thomas said — unless your family badly needs food, and the food bank periodically holds giveaways of beef, watermelons and new sneakers for kids to go back to school.

“Help is something that everybody needs at one time or another,” Thomas said. She envisions the new center as a state of the art meeting place that can help fulfill Torrington’s needs, from food to clothing to showers and laundry. “We want it to be a community place where people are proud to come and accept and receive the help that we’re able to give.” 
Michelle Cook, who completed her term as state representative for the area earlier this year, said that the rise in need can be attributed in part to the fact that there are several smaller communities that rely on Torrington’s food pantry, whereas other areas of the state aren’t as reliant on a single pantry. The current pantry is operating far beyond what it can reasonably handle.
“We’re doing it there, but we’re bursting at the seams,” Cook said.
According to Thomas, Friendly Hands fed just 300 a month people back in 2020, compared with more than 11,000 today. That might also be attributable to the way Thomas and others have breathed new life into the organization since she took it over in February 2020. Back then, the longtime director had died, handing over the job to another director, who quickly died of a drug overdose. Thomas discovered when she took over the pantry that it had almost no money, and she went to Mayor Carbone to hand over the keys.
But Carbone said the pantry’s survival was just too important to the community, which rallied around Friendly Hands. And just in time: a month later, the COVID-19 pandemic brought food insecurity to new heights.
Thomas says that those numbers have only continued to climb, even as federal funding available during the pandemic has disappeared. Cuts to SNAP have people like Jason Jakubowski, the director of Connecticut Foodshare, losing sleep as they imagine a not so distant future when food insecurity reaches a breaking point:  
“That is the No. 1 thing that keeps me up at night now,” Jakubowski said. “The SNAP cuts and the Medicaid cuts haven’t even really taken effect yet. So what we’re trying to do here in Connecticut is we’re trying to stay ahead of the curve.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3557-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-05 17:56:42.263467

President Donald Trump’s phaseout of clean energy tax credits will make solar and wind projects more expensive, but some states are still committed to clean energy mandates. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.




We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce



“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
 Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
 A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
Trump aims to shut down state climate policies

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

July 4, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceAn open letter to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer published Tuesday is asking her to reject federal grant funding for new immigration enforcement detention centers in Michigan.
The letter was drafted by the No Detention Centers in Michigan coalition following the July announcement of a nationwide support grant program operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with $608 million for the construction of new centers like Florida’s “Alligator Alacatraz.” Opponents have called the facility’s conditions inhumane, but it has been lauded by supporters of President Donald Trump and his administration’s immigration policies.
More ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ centers to be built by states flush with cash, experts predict

With the Florida facility already facing lawsuits challenging rights violations, as well as prisoner reports on the lack of food and water at Alligator Alcatraz, the No Detention Centers in Michigan coalition is asking Whitmer to back away from any deal offering federal money to build new centers in Michigan.
“Conditions such as these are endemic to the U.S. immigration detention system. They will only worsen as the Trump administration continues its push for an unprecedented expansion of the detention and deportation machine, with increasing reports nationwide of death, medical neglect, discrimination, abuse, and punitive transfers,” the letter said. “We know that whatever new prisons are built will come with their own incentives to be filled, and that the continued growth of this cruel apparatus represents a key facet of an emboldened white nationalist program.”
The federal government has already allocated more than $150 billion for immigration enforcement, which includes money to reopen previously-shuttered prisons, including the former North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan.
Now referred to as the North Lake Processing Center, it was a federal immigration-only prison beginning in 2019. It was shut down in 2022 but reopened with an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract in June of this year. The facility is now the largest ICE detention center in the Midwest and one of the largest in the nation.

Advocates noted that immigration raids in Michigan have escalated in frequency in recent months, which trends with the reopening of the Baldwin center. They have also cited Whitmer’s lack of a public commitment to not participate in FEMA’s grant program. The coalition said it had concerns that the state-funded Michigan Works! employment agency has collaborated with the Florida-based GEO Group on hiring staff for the North Lake center.
The letter also urged Whitmer to ensure that Michigan Works! no longer collaborates with GEO Group.
“The Trump administration’s current attempt to weaponize FEMA as an additional tool of mass imprisonment and deportation is emblematic of a white supremacist agenda that prioritizes the sadistic scapegoating of immigrants over the provision of resources needed for all people’s safety and flourishing,” the letter to Whitmer said.
Richard Kessler, a member of the coalition that sent the letter, said the last thing Michigan needs is more prisons – for immigrants or otherwise.
“It’s already unacceptable that Michigan Works! is funneling taxpayer money and resources toward the GEO Group so they can cash in on tearing families apart and locking up our immigrant neighbors in Baldwin,” Kessler said in a statement. “The news about FEMA is another reminder that private prisons aren’t the only problem. What allows companies like GEO to swoop in and profit from suffering is the agenda set by the federal government. And it’s very clear to us that this administration will go after immigrants with whatever methods they can.”
Whitmer’s office deferred comment to the Michigan Department of Corrections, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)ANACONDA — Local, state and federal officials gathered on the lawn in front of Deer Lodge County Courthouse on Tuesday morning to provide an update on the search for a man who shot several individuals on Friday.
Michael Brown, 45, is accused of killing four people on Aug. 1 in the Owl Bar in Anaconda around 10:30 a.m.. He then fled, stealing a pickup truck. Brown hasn’t been seen since Friday, officials said, and little new information was available. However, later Tuesday according to an NBC Montana interview with Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton, Brown, in fact, had been seen over the weekend. 
Agencies are still operating under the assumption he is alive. It’s unclear where Brown is.
“We don’t have specific information, but look, he was able to escape and get up in the mountains,” Attorney General Austin Knudsen said. “We are absolutely operating under the assumption that he is armed and extremely dangerous.”

Gov. Greg Gianforte said on Tuesday he has signed an executive order to help share the costs of law enforcement activity. He also held a moment of silence for the victims — 59-year-old Daniel Edwin Baillie, 64-year-old Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 70-year-old David Allen Leach, and 74-year-old Tony Wayne Palm — all of whom were Anaconda residents.
“The state has already been supporting this investigation with staff and aviation assets,” Gianforte said during the press conference. “This action today will ensure additional financial resources are available as we continue to track down this criminal.”
Knudsen said the U.S. Marshall’s Service has increased the reward for information leading to Brown’s capture to $10,000. Gianforte said the National Guard has provided assistance during the search. Other federal resources, including intelligence gathering were used, according to Richard Baer, an FBI official at the briefing. 
It was unclear from the briefing what type of intelligence resources were used. Officials had little to say on the search area, how big it was or how many people are still involved in the search. Gianforte’s executive order, however, mentions there are approximately 150 personnel involved. It was unclear how much money the executive order opens up.
Montana Division of Criminal Investigation Administrator Lee Johnson said the search perimeter had expanded, but did not provide further details, calling it “operational” information law enforcement wasn’t sharing publicly.
Knudsen did add there was no evidence any homes or cabins had been broken into. Sweeps have been conducted by law enforcement in the area.
What happened in the initial moments between the shooting and Brown’s escape remains unclear. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney Morgan Smith briefly expounded on the timeline, but said the county “wasn’t in a position to disclose” further information.

“Once Mr. Brown was leaving, I can tell you that the law enforcement response to the realization that he was leaving was nearly immediate,” Smith said. “But outside of that, I wouldn’t be able to provide any more specifics.”
In Anaconda, people were walking around and there was not a heavy first responder presence in the town itself. One coffee shop was trying to figure out if they could supply caffeine for first responders and residents were talking about the shooting.
“When the dust settles and our community is safe again, we will answer all of the questions,” Smith said. “In the meantime, we ask that you take information that you see on social media with a grain of salt. We ask you to refrain from information you do not know to be true.”
Some residents in Anaconda have complained about information being shared, including law enforcement positions and helicopter flight patterns. Social media was also afire in regards to the shooting in the immediate aftermath, per reporting from the Montana Standard.

(Photo by Austin Fisher)The panel in charge of New Mexico’s mental health reforms on Tuesday approved the initial steps toward creating a locally driven system for treating mental health diagnoses.
New Mexico this year enacted Senate Bill 3, which is meant to rebuild the state’s systems for treating mental health diagnoses by allowing local communities to identify the resources they need. The new law created the Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act Executive Committee, and made it responsible for implementing it.
The five-member committee in June adopted 13 “behavioral health regions,” in which counties, municipalities, Native American nations and community health organizations are expected to work together.
On Tuesday, the committee unanimously voted to endorse a project timeline for the regions created by Behavioral Health Integration and Reform Administrator Esperanza Lucero. She told them the overarching goals include strengthening capacity for mental health treatment and finding solutions that will be sustainable in the long-run.
“We want this to be the last reform that New Mexico goes through,” Lucero said.
Next week, the AOC expects to open up applications for county managers in each region to designate one entity — either a government or a nongovernmental organization — responsible for identifying gaps between which mental health services exist and what their communities need, Lucero told the committee.
Each region will then hold a workshop at which they will vote on up to five local priorities, which will inform an application to the committee for grant funding, Lucero said. Some regions may have similar priorities, she said, but the way they address them will be unique.
Those solutions may include, for example, medication assisted treatment for substance use disorder; newly built community mental health centers; or psychosocial rehabilitation services. Those are some of the most needed mental health services in New Mexico, according to initial findings from a third-party study conducted by Public Consulting Group presented to the committee by HCA Director of Behavioral Health Transformation and Innovation Kristie Brooks.
Lucero said she hopes some regions will hold workshops and ask for grants by the end of this year, and the rest will apply in 2026. The grants will come out of a specific pot of money totaling approximately $209 million approved by lawmakers in the state government’s annual budget in the most recent session, according to a breakdown presented to the committee by Legislative Finance Committee Principal Analyst Ruby Ann Esquibel.

(Photo by Joeff Davis)While Wisconsin’s incumbent governor is opting out of seeking a third term, the open and growing field has led a couple of former governors to stir conversation about whether they will run again in 2026 or beyond.
Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to run makes 2026 the first open race for governor since 2010, when Scott Walker, then the Milwaukee County executive, defeated Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. Former Gov. Jim Doyle, who served from 2003 to 2011, had declined to run for a third term. 
Evers said he chose not to run again next year because he wants to spend more time with his family.
Former Gov. Tommy Thompson did not rule out a run for governor in 2026 while speaking with 620 WTMJ on Monday afternoon. 
“Why not?” Thompson said in response to the question about whether he would run for governor. “I haven’t said no. There’s a lot of good candidates and I have no desire to get in the race, but the truth of the matter is, I’ll wait and see what’s out there.” 
There are two declared Republican candidates in the race so far: Washington County Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has also been teasing a run for the last several weeks.  
Only one Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, has officially launched her campaign since Evers’ announcement on July 24. Other potential candidates include Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, Attorney General Josh Kaul, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. 
Thompson is the only governor in Wisconsin to have been elected to four terms, serving from 1987 to 2001. Wisconsin is one of 13 states in the U.S. without term limits on governors, according to Ballotpedia.
Thompson left the office to serve as President George W. Bush’s Health and Human Services secretary. He also previously served as University of Wisconsin system president. This is not the first time that he has floated seeking a potential fifth term, having mentioned it in 2022.
Thompson said Monday that his wife and children would be opposed to him running for another term, but he signaled that he feels he would be up to the task. By the time the next term starts, Thompson would be 85.  
“I’m in great physical health. My mind is sharp as hell. I’ve got things that I’d like to accomplish, but it’s way too early for me to make that decision, way too early,” Thompson said.
Walker, who served two terms as governor, recently said he wouldn’t be running for governor in 2026 after making cryptic posts on social media that pointed to potential nonconsecutive terms. He lost the office to Evers in a close election in 2018. 
“I’m not going to be a candidate, at least not next year. It doesn’t mean I’ll never run again,” he said in a video posted to social media. Walker, who is 57, added that he is a “quarter century” younger than former President Joe Biden. 
“Looking ahead, though, Tonette [Walker] and I will do everything we can at our home here in Wisconsin to ensure that we elect a common sense conservative as governor in next year’s election,” he said. 
Walker said he would be continuing his work as president of Young America’s Foundation, a conservative nonprofit focused on youth, and emphasized that Republicans need to do better outreach to young voters.
Wisconsin has only had one governor serve nonconsecutive terms.
Prior to Wisconsin adopting four-year terms for its governors, former Gov. Philip La Follette served his first term as governor from 1931 to 1933 as a Republican. 
According to the National Governors Association, La Follette, the son of former U.S. Sen. “Fighting Bob” La Follette, spent a significant portion of his time in office seeking the expansion of public works, including highway construction, increased government control over the electric power and banking industries and helped set up an unemployment insurance program, which became a model for similar legislation in other states. 
La Follette ran for another term in 1932 but was defeated by Democratic Gov. Albert G. Schmedeman. 
After one term out of office, La Follette ran for governor again in 1934, this time as a third party candidate for the newly formed Progressive Party. He went on to serve a second and third term from 1935 to 1939.

Among the failures discovered in the jail’s latest biennial inspection were discrepancies in medical records, improper management of medication and medical sharps like needles, and not following infectious disease protocols. 
As a result, the jail is required to immediately stop all new intakes, return all defendants being housed under contract with federal authorities to their original facility, and create a plan of corrective action by Aug. 8 that either immediately addresses the health and safety concerns or transfers the jail’s population to other facilities until those concerns can be addressed. 
If these steps are not taken, the Department of Corrections will revoke the jail’s operating license and transfer out its current population, according to the notice of restriction sent to the jail administrator, county commissioners and sheriff on Tuesday. 
During the inspection, which occurred on July 21 and 22, the facility failed 11 mandatory standards and the Department of Corrections was unable to review nine others due to lack of documentation. Regarding essential standards, the jail failed one and the department was unable to review 61 others, again because of an absence of documentation.
The inspection had originally been scheduled for May 27 but a temporary extension was granted after the jail administrator, Jean Larson, requested additional time to prepare, according to the notice.  
Jails are required to meet all mandatory standards and at least 90% of essential standards, as  set by the commissioner of the Maine Department of Correction, which is currently Randall Liberty, pursuant to state law.

(Photo via Google Earth)A former Grinnell College student has agreed to drop her lawsuit against the school for its alleged handling of her claim that she was raped by a student athlete who was the son of a major donor.
Court records indicate attorneys for the student, who is identified only as Jane Doe, have filed a notice of “stipulated dismissal” in the case. The phrase “stipulated dismissal” typically refers to a formal, written agreement between all parties in a lawsuit documenting the particulars of an out-of-court settlement.
Mattia Wells, Grinnell’s director of strategic communications and media relations, said Tuesday the school has a policy not commenting on litigation, current or otherwise, and also has a policy that prohibits disclosure of any settlement agreements.
Doe was a student at Grinnell College from September 2018 until May 2022. Doe alleges that on April 20, 2019, she was violently raped in her dorm room on the Grinnell campus by a Grinnell student athlete and the son of a major Grinnell donor. Doe claims her attacker, who is not identified in the lawsuit by name, used extreme physical force and violently knocked her head into a bookshelf, toppling it.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
About two weeks later, Doe alleges, she was assaulted by the same individual who pinched her and poured a drink on her at an off-campus party.
In her lawsuit, filed in October 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, Doe claimed she sought treatment for sexual trauma through Grinnell’s student health program, sought assistance from Grinnell’s administration, and ultimately filed a formal sexual-assault complaint through Grinnell’s Title IX program.
Only after she retained legal counsel and demanded that a Title IX action be initiated against the alleged perpetrator did Grinnell take any action, the lawsuit claimed. Even then, the adjudication of the Title IX action took more than a year and resulted in what the lawsuit calls a “superficial sanction” against the alleged perpetrator days before his graduation in 2022.
The school denied the allegations in court. At the time, Wells said Grinnell had “robust policies, procedures, and resources in place addressing all aspects of the Title IX process.”
In May of last year, the court found that portions of Jane Doe’s Title IX claims were barred due to Title IX’s two-year statute of limitations. However, the court allowed other legal claims made by Doe to proceed.
Doe claimed that in the wake of the assault, her mental health deteriorated to a critical level and she constantly felt unsafe on Grinnell’s campus. In January 2020, during a period of suicidal ideation, she contacted Grinnell Student Health and the office of the college nurse to inform them of an urgent need for a sexual-trauma therapist, according to the lawsuit.
The college nurse allegedly referred Doe to the school’s mental health counselor, Erik Kohl, who immediately recognized the seriousness of Doe’s mental health issues and ultimately diagnosed Doe with post-traumatic stress disorder due to sexual trauma, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleged that a short time later, amidst the growing national “MeToo” movement, an anonymous Instagram account was established with the handle @MeTooGrinnell. By August of 2020, the account contained approximately 120 posts from students who claimed they had been victims of sexual assault or rape on campus. Through those posts, Doe’s family concluded that Doe’s alleged rapist “had engaged in an ongoing pattern of rape and sexual assault on Grinnell’s campus,” the lawsuit claimed.
Doe’s father then contacted Grinnell’s president, Anne Harris, to alert her to the allegations. According to the lawsuit, Harris notified the family of Title IX protections that were available for students at Grinnell and referred the family to Bailey Asberry, the school’s Title IX coordinator. Asberry allegedly discouraged Doe from formally reporting the sexual assault and referred Doe to the school’s dean of religious life who, in turn, referred Doe back to Asberry, according to the lawsuit.
Lawsuit: School proposed mediation with alleged attacker 
The lawsuit claims Asberry told Doe the only way for the school to respond to the allegation against the perpetrator was if she filed a formal complaint — a step Doe was reluctant to take for fear of retaliation and retribution. At that point, the lawsuit claims, Asberry “made the highly inappropriate and unfathomable suggestion that (Doe) sit down with the perpetrator ‘face-to-face’ to ‘mediate’ her violent rape and sexual assault with the perpetrator.”
After Doe demanded the school pursue a formal investigation, Asberry allegedly informed her the incidents she had described were “not severe enough” and would not be investigated by Grinnell, the lawsuit claimed.
Eventually, a Grinnell investigator conducted 11 interviews of six people, and concluded his investigation on Aug. 25, 2021. His preliminary report was “riddled with factual errors, misstatements of the applicable policy provisions, and obvious instances of gender bias,” the lawsuit claimed.
At a Title IX hearing, an adjudicator found the accused student to be responsible for “sexual assault, non-consensual sexual intercourse” and for “sexual assault, non-consensual sexual contact.” Grinnell then imposed sanctions against the alleged perpetrator that the lawsuit describes as “wildly inappropriate and ineffective.”
The school placed the alleged perpetrator on probation for the remainder of his attendance at Grinnell, a period of 23 days; imposed a no-contact order; barred him from participating in graduation if Doe chose to attend; and barred him from participating in future alumni events attended by Doe.
The lawsuit accused Grinnell College of deliberate indifference to sexual abuse, creation of a hostile educational environment, failure to prevent retaliation, retaliation by withholding protections conferred by Title IX, gender bias, discrimination on the basis of gender, violations of constitutional rights, and breach of contract.
In 2015, Grinnell College was investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights in response to complaints filed by six students. The complaints alleged the school failed to impose adequate consequences for students accused of sexual assault, that administrators improperly revealed the identity of a victim, and that one student faced retaliation for their views on Grinnell’s handling of sexual assaults on campus.
In 2017, the Office for Civil Rights notified Grinnell the case had been administratively closed with a determination that there were no active “systemic issues” that warranted a continuation of the investigation.

A longer list that the U.S. Department of Justice issued in May left some observers baffled about some of the Republican-led and -leaning jurisdictions included, such as Cumberland and Warren counties.
So the feds retracted and revised it, and now, no New Jersey counties are on the list. Even New Jersey itself isn’t among the 12 states (plus the District of Columbia) that the feds have labeled as sanctuary states — even though Alina Habba, New Jersey’s acting U.S. attorney, vowed in April to investigate Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over the Immigrant Trust Directive, a state order that restricts when state and local police officers can cooperate with federal immigration agents.
A Murphy spokeswoman declined to comment Tuesday.
In announcing the shorter list, Attorney General Pamela Bondi also blasted sanctuary policies, saying they impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk.
“The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country,” Bondi said in a statement.
The department sued Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Hoboken, and their elected officials in May, asking a judge to block policies they say interfere with the Trump administration’s immigration detention and deportation goals.
The cities have a deadline to respond to that lawsuit by the end of August.
The list released Tuesday was meant, under an executive order Trump signed in April, to identify jurisdictions that “continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws.”
States on the list are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Four counties are on the list — Baltimore, Cook County in Illinois, and San Diego and San Francisco counties in California. Fourteen cities, including Philadelphia and New York City, are listed in addition to Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken.
At least one city has caved to the feds’ pressure. Louisville last month dropped its policy of not holding people in custody on immigration detainers.

(U.S. Navy photo by John Narewski)After debate over procurement last year, the Virginia-class submarine program is on track to maintain its two-per-year cadence for the upcoming fiscal year.
But Connecticut Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney and other lawmakers warned that there are funding gaps in the White House budget request.
Courtney is seeking to fill in that gap as Congress hashes out its annual defense policy bill that authorizes, among other things, shipbuilding needs. That money could help Groton-based Electric Boat and others address the growing costs of materials and backlogs in production as the submarine industry tries to meet the long-term goals of both the Navy and a U.S. submarine deal with Australia.
To shore up support for two nuclear-powered vessels in fiscal year 2026, Courtney proposed an amendment for an additional $1 billion that went into the House’s version of the National Defense Authorization Act. The House Armed Services Committee easily passed it in a voice vote in mid-July, though the bill is still working its way through Congress before it’s likely finalized later this year.
“We worked with the Navy. We basically went through 24 different line items in the Navy’s budget to basically scrub and squeeze funds to pay for that billion dollars,” Courtney said, noting it got done in time for the committee markup of the NDAA last month. “I think there’s real urgency to make sure that the program keeps the momentum up and gets the right production cadence.”
Courtney, the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said the shortfall comes amid the administration’s two-pronged approach to funding the procurement of two Virginia-class for the new fiscal year: paying for one boat through the standard budget process and covering the other through the budget reconciliation process used to pass President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
That bill, which was signed into law in early July, included $4.6 billion in funding for a second boat for fiscal year 2026. An initial version of the legislation had the money designated for fiscal year 2027.
Now that Congress has moved on to the NDAA and regular appropriations process, they are sorting out the funding for the other submarine. The White House’s FY26 base budget request sought about $816 million for standard procurement plus a few billion for advanced procurement of long lead-time materials for future submarines.
To address what was viewed as inadequate funding for two submarines, the House committee ultimately approved the NDAA by combining the $816 million with the $1 billion from Courtney’s amendment for standard procurement for FY26.
Lawmakers in both parties took issue with the Trump administration’s approach to funding the nuclear-powered submarines and the way it relied on the special budgetary process to pass Trump’s tax bill that also included substantial defense funds.
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., expressed dismay over the process during a June hearing with Navy officials, a few weeks before Congress approved the reconciliation bill.
The shipbuilding component in the White House’s defense budget request for FY26 is $20.8 billion, which lawmakers pointed out was well below the nearly $37 billion sought last year under the Biden administration.
Wicker said the Navy’s shipbuilding request “falls far short to protect our country” and “game[s] the budget in anticipation of budget reconciliation, which was intended as a supplemental, not a substitute.” Since that hearing, the reconciliation bill has become law and the White House released its FY26 defense budget plan in full.
Electric Boat locations in Groton and Quonset Point
Navy officials said they are committed to getting the industry back on track to carry out the service’s shipbuilding needs and bolster capacity. U.S. Navy Secretary John Phelan said he visited 10 shipyards since he took the helm, including trips to Electric Boat locations in Groton and Quonset Point in Rhode Island back in April.
“For too long, we’ve allowed our shipbuilding industry to erode, hollowing out the very capacity we need to maintain credible naval deterrents. That must change. Rebuilding our maritime industrial base is not just a matter of economic policy, it is a national security imperative,” Phelan said at the June hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. “We do need to act with urgency, and this will take a whole-of-government approach to rebuild our capacity and expertise.”
The Navy and Electric Boat declined to comment on the FY26 Virginia-class funding.
Courtney similarly raised concerns about a “fragmented” budget process for the Virginia-class program split between reconciliation and the base budget bill. But he credited the bipartisan work on the House’s NDAA for addressing the issue.
He also pointed out that the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget will have discretion over the sub funding covered in the reconciliation bill since that agency oversaw the process.
“It just created more confusion about the normal budget process, and that’s why it was such a scramble, because no one really had any clarity about the budget,” Courtney said. “And we still kind of don’t already, because we still haven’t completed NDAA and we still haven’t completed the appropriations process.”
“Once the reconciliation bill got passed, at least there was some clarity that you could go into the programs and try to clean up the gaps that were exposed,” he continued. “There’s definitely going to be more work to be done to make all these pieces sort of fit together.”
But between the funding through the various legislation — reconciliation, the NDAA and defense appropriations legislation — and his amendment, Courtney argued the Virginia-class program is “very secure.”
“Honestly, for FY26, there was never a question that there was going to be two subs whether there was a budget reconciliation bill or not,” he said. “And it just shows there’s just huge consensus about the fact that there was going to be two subs in FY26.”










We worked with the Navy. We basically went through 24 different line items in the Navy’s budget to basically scrub and squeeze funds to pay for that billion dollars


– U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat whose district includes Groton


His eastern Connecticut district includes Electric Boat’s Groton shipyard and many of the suppliers that work with the General Dynamics company. Electric Boat locations in Groton and Quonset Point, R.I., handle much of the Virginia-class program, along with Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia.
But these sub costs are changing because some of the contracts were authorized before the pandemic, and prices for materials have grown. Plus, some of the subs under construction are different models and require more to build them.
Courtney noted some of the newer vessels will feature a payload module that includes more missile tubes and thus are bigger and more expensive. Ships built over the last two decades displace about 7,800 tons submerged, while the Virginia Payload Module surpasses 10,000 tons.
“It’s new design and new size, and so that’s where the cost issues arise,” he said.
Wicker also raised concerns at the June hearing that the upcoming Columbia-class submarines are also underfunded. Electric Boat is also the lead contractor on the nuclear-powered ballistic missiles vessels to replace its Ohio-class submarines. It is similarly working with Newport News Shipbuilding on the construction.
The House’s NDAA would authorize incremental funding for one Columbia submarine, which Courtney said “is the way to keep the lights on.” The GOP’s reconciliation didn’t include any funding for that program.
The goal of the Navy is producing two Virginia-class and one Columbia-class a year. But the actual production rate has been below that for Virginia, around 1.2 boats per year since 2022, according to a March report from the Congressional Research Service.
That has resulted in a backlog, though the report said the Navy and the sub industry are aiming to get the production rate to two a year by 2028 and eventually up to 2.33 boats a year. If they can hit those markers, that’ll allow contractors to keep up with the pace of Virginia-class procurement. And it’ll help meet the needs of AUKUS, the trade agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S., so Australia can buy between three and five Virginia-class submarines starting in the early 2030s.
While it passed out of both House and Senate committees this month, the annual defense policy bill is still in the early stages. The NDAA authorizes defense spending, but lawmakers will still need to go through separate appropriations bills to allocate such funding.
In the coming months, Congress is likely to use another short-term bill, or a continuing resolution, to keep the government running. While that will keep most federal funding at current levels, lawmakers can use what’s known as anomalies to make adjustments and provide more funding in certain cases.
Last December, lawmakers passed a short-term funding bill that included $5.7 billion in emergency funding for the submarine industrial base. In the fiscal year 2025 defense policy bill, Congress provided full funding for one Virginia-class submarine and “incremental” funding for a second.
Courtney commended the Navy at a June hearing for releasing the submarine industrial base funds approved last year. He said it played a role in helping to resolve contract issues between Electric Boat and the Marine Draftsmen’s Association, whose membership was preparing to go on strike in the spring.
He said it “boost[ed] wage rates of metal trades workers in southern New England by 30% over a 5-year span.”

Tim Dunn’s contributions to the Great Lakes Conservative Fund, or GLCF, were made in two installments of $2.5 million each in April and June and accounted for more than 98% of the PAC’s total fundraising during the first half of 2025, according to a mid-year report filed July 31 with the Federal Election Commission. 
Dunn, the CEO of Midland-based CrownQuest Operating, has long been a major financier of far-right political causes in Texas and beyond, with his deep-pocketed influence drawing national attention for pushing Christian nationalist ideology, which critics say aims to reshape American democracy to reflect a narrow interpretation of Christian values.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Former Republican Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, who is Jewish, told the Texas Tribune that Dunn felt he was unqualified to hold that position, telling him in 2010 that “only Christians should hold leadership positions” in that state’s lower chamber. 
CNN also reported that former associates of Dunn said his ultimate goal was to “replace public education with private Christian schooling.”
A request for comment by Michigan Advance was sent to Dunn, but has yet to be answered.
Dunn’s support of Rogers, a former mid-Michigan congressman seeking the GOP nomination to run for U.S. Senate in 2026, marks a significant foray into Midwest politics by an out-of-state donor known for reshaping Texas’s Republican Party in his own image, but who has also shown an increasing interest in influencing national politics.
While the Great Lakes Conservatives Fund is an independent expenditure-only committee and is legally prohibited from coordinating directly with Rogers or his campaign, Rogers has not publicly spoken about Dunn’s involvement in the race, and his campaign did not respond to a request for comment by Michigan Advance.
The Detroit News reported that the PAC spent more than $21 million on Rogers’ unsuccessful 2024 U.S. Senate run, which he narrowly lost to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly).  
However, Dunn’s political network has also come under fire for its ties to white supremacists and antisemites. 
In 2023, a top official at one of Dunn’s Texas-based PACs, Defend Texas Liberty, met with white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who has openly espoused antisemetic views including that the Holocaust was “exaggerated”.
While Dunn called the the Fuentes meeting “a serious blunder,” the Texas Tribune uncovered numerous close ties between other associates of Fuentes and the Defend Texas Liberty PAC, which Dunn later shut down before launching a new PAC called Texans United for a Conservative Majority.
Regardless, Dunn has become one of the most influential Republican donors in the country, donating $5 million to President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign for the White House, while also co-founding the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank that has produced more than a dozen officials now staffing the Trump administration including Education Secretary Linda McMahon and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
Rogers, meanwhile, has cleared the GOP field and is the lone Republican seeking the nomination for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9-1024x766.jpeg,,,2025-08-05 16:56:30.636163

(Via Florida PSC)Consumer activists said Tuesday that the proposed $9.8 billion rate hike that Florida Power & Light (FPL) is asking for is excessive and should be rejected by state regulators.
In February, FPL, the state’s largest public utility servicing approximately 12 million people, submitted a four-year request for the Public Service Commission (PSC) to set new rates once its current base rate agreement expires at the end of this year.

“Floridians are facing a full-blown affordability crisis,” said Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer with Food & Water Watch. “Yet FPL wants to raise rates by almost $10 billion over the next 4 years. Let’s be honest, this is not about reliability or infrastructure, it’s about boosting profits.”
In June, the state Office of Public Counsel told the PSC that FPL would be overcharging customers were the proposed rate hike approved and said it should receive only around $105 million of the nearly $10 billion it is asking for.
Among the organizations that have been rallying their members to contact the PSC to tell them to oppose FPL’s proposed rate increase is the AARP. The senior-rights group created an online petition months ago asking its nearly 3 million Florida members who are also FPL consumers to ask the PSC not to approve the rate increase
“FPL is proposing a sharp increase on monthly electric bills, and older residents living on fixed incomes will be hit the hardest,” said Zayne Smith, senior director for advocacy with AARP Florida. “FPL is also seeking the highest return on investment in the country. This is not about serving customers. It’s about corporate greed and the customers who will pay the price.”
In its petition to the PSC, FPL says if its proposed rate increases are approved it will earn a return on equity of 11.9%. That’s the percentage of profit a utility company generates relative to the amount of money invested by shareholders. The national average is 9.5%.
Residential customers can calculate how the proposal would affect their individual bills by using the calculator feature at FPL.com/answers, according to a news release. By 2029, the “typical” FPL customer in Florida would pay $151.99 per month compared with the $134.14 a month average customers in peninsular Florida now pay and the $143.60 a month average that Panhandle customers now pay, according to FPL.
The difference between “rates” and “bills”
Residential rates would be raised by about 2.5%, FPL officials say, which would keep bills well below the national average and below many other Florida electric utilities.
But opponents counter that claim. Ward says there’s a difference between “rates” and “bills.”
“At the end of the day, FPL customers will be paying higher bills. And what do Florida families care about? The amount that they put in their bill,” she said, adding that utilities in Florida can collect additional funds from items like storm recovery costs that came last year in the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene.
And in May of this year, the PSC approved Storm Protection Plan agreements for FPL, Duke Energy Florida, Tampa Electric Co., and Florida Public Utilities Co. designed to strengthen long-term storm protection measures and improve grid resilience.
How much is “public” about the Public Service Commission?
Tampa Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, criticized the Public Service Commission, saying it should be renamed the “Utility Service Commission” because “more often than not, they are in service to the electric utilities, rather than the public.”
Displeasure with the PSC isn’t limited to Democratic lawmakers.
Florida Supreme Court Justice Carlos Muñiz late last year basted the PSC for not providing enough information to justify a public utility rate increase. He made those remarks after the Supreme Court in September 2023 ruled that the PSC did not adequately justify approval of a settlement that increased base electric rates for FPL and ordered a new explanation, the News Service of Florida reported.
Panhandle Republican state Sen. Don Gaetz filed a bill (SB 354) during the 2025 legislative session that would have required the PSC to become much more transparent in its actions.
Its provisions included that the agency provide adequate support for its conclusions when issuing orders; keep the return on equity for public utilities as close as possible to the risk-free rate of return; and submit an annual report of public utility rates that includes benchmarking and analysis on economics, cost impacts, return on equity, and executive compensation.
The bill passed in one committee in the Senate before failing to advance. Gaetz said the measure was killed by the public utilities, according to Politico.
Public hearings for the PSC to consider the rate hike will begin on Aug. 11. The final decision is expected in the fall.

The PSC announced the hearing during a docket meeting Tuesday, a week after it released a third-party report detailing the struggles of the power provider. The report echoed previous criticisms from state lawmakers, the PSC, the Tennessee Valley Authority and others blaming Holly Springs officials for not investing in its power supply system over the years and allowing it to deteriorate to a point where customers have seen constant outages. 
Holly Springs, which buys power through a contract with TVA, serves about 12,000 customers in Marshall, Benton and Lafayette counties as well as a small part of Tennessee.
The PSC, which regulates utilities in the state, initially tried to schedule a hearing for Jan. 7 in Jackson. But Holly Springs successfully appealed after arguing one of its lawyers, Sen. Bradford Blackmon, needed to be with the state Legislature then. The PSC then agreed to delay the hearing until after the legislative session.

The state initially had no jurisdiction over the Holly Springs Utility Department, but a 2024 bill that became law gave the PSC the power to investigate the utility and recommend, if it decides the utility doesn’t provide “reasonably adequate service,” that a court put the department into a receivership.
“We strongly encourage public participation in the upcoming show-cause hearing, emphasizing that this is more than a procedural requirement — it is critical for HSUD to address the issues raised in the report and to clarify its actions,” the commission said in a press release Tuesday. “By working together, we can ensure that the outcome serves the best interests of the people who rely on HSUD services.”
The company behind last week’s report, Silverpoint Consulting, wrote that it may be hard to find a receiver willing to take on the utility, and instead recommended one of three options: selling the utility to another city or cooperative utility; converting it into a cooperative to open up access to low-interest loans; or seeking eminent domain and condemnation.
Holly Springs is also facing a lawsuit from TVA, which alleges the city mishandled funds from the utility and failed to raise rates when needed. On June 9, though, a federal judge ordered a 90-day stay in the case. Then on July 24, court filings show, both parties told the court they would meet on Aug. 15 to “discuss a negotiated resolution of this action.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/04223114/Chris-Brown-7.jpg,,,2025-08-05 15:57:26.798468

English Language Development Coordinator Melisha Otero is in her sixth year with the district. In that time, she’s seen the number of English language learner (ELL) students increase dramatically.
During the 2020-21 school year, the number of ELL students hit a recent low of 222, according to state records. By the 2023-24 school year, the latest state data available, that number had nearly doubled.
Otero said it’s even higher now as the district prepares to enter the school year with about 550 active ELL students. Another 184 who recently learned English are being monitored.
That’s only about 3% of the district’s most recently reported enrollment. But it represents one of the ways Lee’s Summit has become more diverse, requiring it to adjust to meet the needs of its current students.
Last year, the district introduced a phone interpretation service called Propio. Events such as family culture nights attempt to build inclusivity. And a two-week welcome center in the district’s central office is open to all but specifically geared toward immigrant families.
Otero said the number of teachers for English language learners has roughly doubled since she joined the district, to 17.
She’d like to see even more staff. She also wants the school district and broader community to understand how rapidly the ELL growth is happening and how to support and include students.
“It’s challenging, just because I feel like we are the unseen population in the district,” she said. “If you look at numbers, it’s obvious that our department has grown. But Lee’s Summit is still slow to grow in accepting the fact that there’s a huge change in diversity in our population here.”
Who are the ELL students?
There’s diversity among ELL students as well.
Slightly more than half speak Spanish, 9% Arabic, 5% Urdu and 5% Vietnamese, Otero said. With 38 languages represented in the district, there are lots of smaller percentages as well.
Jermaine Wilson, assistant superintendent of equity and student services, also named Pashto, Russian, Korean, Pohnpeian, Mandarin, Haitian Creole, Turkish and French as among the district’s languages.
Otero said many of the families have fled hardships in their home countries. Most are refugees or asylum seekers.
Refugees have permission to move to the United States because of persecution in their homelands. Asylum seekers arrive in the U.S. and go through a legal process seeking to stay because of persecution in their home country.
“Our department has really worked on being welcoming to our families,” Otero said. “They feel safe here.”
ELL students make up a small percentage of the district, but that percentage is increasing.
In 2009, the earliest state data available, ELL students were less than 1% of the district’s enrollment. By 2023-24, the percentage had tripled to about 2.5%.
The 550 students Otero counted for this coming year would be more than 3% of the district’s most recently reported enrollment.
The increased ELL enrollment comes as the district has become more diverse overall.
Lee’s Summit schools were more than 95% white in 1991, the earliest data available from the state. Enrollment is now less than two-thirds white.
The percentages of students receiving free and reduced-priced lunch — often used as a proxy for the number of low-income students in a district — has also significantly increased.
Otero said it might take time for the district to register that it’s also becoming more diverse linguistically.
“When people think of diversity, they think of skin color, or they think of socioeconomic status, and that’s not the only thing that’s diverse,” she said. “Cultural and linguistic diversity is important.”
Providing support
On a Thursday in July, Otero and two English language teachers were stationed in the district’s central office to help families enroll. Snacks and school supplies were lined up on tables.
The event, known as the Welcome Center, was especially intended to help non-English speaking families with school enrollment.
Otero said the event drew eight families the first year it started but had far exceeded that number less than halfway through its two-week span this year.
“The fact that we’ve still helped 140 students enroll with what’s going on politically, just lets us know that we’re doing our job, having them feel safe,” she said. “Our teachers work really hard to not just teach their students English but to also build those relationships.”
English language development teachers are trained to teach students English even if they don’t share a language in common, Otero said. About half of the English language teachers in Lee’s Summit are bilingual, which is helpful in communicating with some families.
The teachers go above and beyond to help with needs outside the classroom as well, Otero said, such as making sure families have food, school supplies or reminders to sign paperwork. It could even mean accompanying a teen to an ultrasound appointment.
Otero said the teachers take care of families so well that it helps the program fly under the radar.
“We’re not the squeaky wheel,” she said.
But she tries to be loud in advocating for more resources, reaching outside the district to groups such as churches for extra support.
“They donated calculators because we don’t have any money right now,” she said. “Whatever my teachers and my families need, I’m always willing to advocate for them.”
Awareness and support outside of the department are growing too.
ELL students used to be bused to centralized sites, Otero said, which gave the impression that regular classroom teachers weren’t responsible for them.
“I wouldn’t say there’s not acceptance. I think it’s just ignorance,” Otero said. “Our program is kind of invisible because, in comparison to other departments, it’s significantly smaller. But the amount of growth is 10 times more than any other department.”
ELL teachers have worked hard to provide professional development and help classroom teachers feel a shared sense of ownership for their students, she said.
The district also recently invested in Propio, a phone interpretation service that staff can use to help communicate with families.
“They can walk into a school and say that they have a language need, or (if) anybody in the front office suspects there’s a language need, they can offer the services,” Wilson said. “We can get somebody on the phone within five minutes to help interpret. … That helped out a lot with families feeling welcome in our buildings.”
While families usually prefer in-person interpretation, Otero said, the service helps fill in the gaps when a staff member who speaks the needed language isn’t available. That’s especially key for languages like Pashto where it can be hard to find local interpreters.
Otero said she’d always like to see more resources, particularly more ELL teachers.
And the political climate has made things more difficult as well.
Throughout most of July, schools were in limbo over whether the federal government would release funding for migrant education and English language acquisition.
Otero has also worried some immigrant families won’t come to school.
“When I have my families not feeling safe, or have my high school kids dropping out because they don’t feel safe, that doesn’t resonate well with me,” she said. “We find ways to graduate these kiddos. They work really, really hard.”
Ultimately, Otero said, the goal is not just to help students achieve academically.
“We want our students to learn and be successful, but we also want them to feel accepted and part of a community,” she said.
“Once they graduate and have a piece of paper that says, ‘You graduated,’ I want them to have (something) beyond that, so they … can have a good future,” she said. “They came here for that.”

Noem, in an interview with CBS News published Monday, said she hopes to establish a handful of similar detention centers near airports and jails in other states in the coming months, using Florida’s so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades as a model. She said she had already appealed to governors and state leaders.
And CBS said potential sites already under consideration include Nebraska, Arizona and Louisiana.
Many states that support President Donald Trump’s mission of securing the border have empty or underused prison-like facilities, Noem noted. She said locations Homeland Security is considering are by airports and runways, which she said would help cut costs through “quick turnarounds.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operates under the umbrella of Homeland Security.
State-owned property that could fit her site preferences could include land near the Omaha Correctional Center by Eppley Airfield and the Nebraska National Guard base near the Lincoln airport.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen’s office shared a statement Tuesday, saying that his team “continues to be in communication with federal partners on how Nebraska can best assist in these efforts.”

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the governor is “staunchly committed to keeping Americans safe, our nation’s borders secure” and getting criminals “off our streets.”
She said it was premature to comment on potential detention operations, adding: “Gov. Pillen will make details public at the appropriate time.”
An ICE spokesperson told the Examiner in a statement Tuesday that the agency could not confirm “individual pre-decisional conversations” but that it will “confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements.”
The agency blamed the Biden administration’s border policies, and added: “ICE is proud to say we have enhanced enforcement and routine daily operations that have resulted in a significant number of arrests” necessitating greater detention capacity.
Noem’s strategy reportedly builds upon the “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center that opened last month at a jetport in the South Florida marshlands. It  was built in just days and has the capacity to house 3,000 migrants.
The effort would be assisted by the $45 billion set aside for ICE in President Donald Trump’s recently adopted “big beautiful bill.”

Nebraska State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a legislative watchdog on criminal justice issues, criticized the notion of Nebraska as a host site.
“The idea of Nebraska operating a state-run detention facility is crazy and should not move forward,” he said. “Our focus should be on addressing the current budget deficit and reversing the decline of our state’s economy, both of which will only worsen with proposals like this.”
McKinney said that under the Trump administration, “enforcement efforts have expanded far beyond individuals labeled as criminals.”
“Many law-abiding immigrants are being unjustly detained and torn away from their families,” he said.
Nebraska State Sen. Margo Juarez was terse in her reaction. Her South Omaha area district includes the work site where a June 10 high-profile immigration raid took place, the largest enforcement operation in Nebraska since Trump took office the second time.
“There is no way we will welcome an Alcatraz — look elsewhere,” Juarez said.
More than 70 undocumented immigrants were apprehended during the ICE-led raid at Glenn Valley Foods. Roughly 25 of the workers are still being detained at a North Platte jail four hours from where their families live. That jail contracts with the federal government to hold ICE detainees who are in removal proceedings.
Officials of Douglas County government previously opted not to renew a federal contract under which it was paid to hold ICE detainees at its Omaha jail.

Comer gave the department until Aug. 19 to turn over the files.Comer issued the subpoenas following bipartisan committee support in late July to compel the release of records after President Donald Trump backtracked on his promise to open the files.Epstein, who pleaded guilty to sex crimes in Florida in 2008, died in a New York City jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges. Epstein’s co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of a wealthy media mogul, is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for her role in the sex trafficking scheme.The former financier had surrounded himself with wealthy and powerful figures, including Trump and the Clintons, among many other influential people.Subpoena listIn letters to several former government officials, Comer wrote that congressional oversight of the government’s investigation of Epstein is “imperative.”“The Committee may use the results of this investigation to inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations. Given your past relationships with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, the Committee believes that you have information regarding their activities that is relevant to the Committee’s investigation,” according to the letters.In addition to the Clintons, Comer also subpoenaed testimony from:Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick GarlandFormer U.S. Attorney General Bill BarrFormer U.S. Attorney General Jeff SessionsFormer U.S. Attorney General Loretta LynchFormer U.S. Attorney General Eric HolderFormer U.S. Attorney General Alberto GonzalesFormer FBI Director James ComeyFormer FBI Director Robert MuellerComer outlined a span of deadlines for the depositions into early October.Comer previously subpoenaed Maxwell for an Aug. 11 deposition. The Kentucky lawmaker denied Maxwell’s request for immunity but agreed to delay her testimony to the committee, according to multiple media reports.Bondi won’t release Epstein filesAttention on the federal case against Epstein swelled after the Justice Department, under current Attorney General Pam Bondi, declined to publicly release case files, as Trump had promised on the campaign trail.According to an unsigned July 7 Justice Department memo, “a systemic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” and department and FBI officials concluded that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”The declaration sparked an uproar among lawmakers and Trump’s voter base, including some in his own administration. The president’s supporters, and Trump himself, have long been fixated on what they describe as the “Epstein files,” with some perpetuating conspiracy theories.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana sent lawmakers home early for August break to avoid votes compelling the release of material. Details of the president’s past relationship with Epstein also surfaced, including a report from the Wall Street Journal that Trump gave the financier a 50th birthday note featuring a cryptic message and the outline of a naked woman with Trump’s signature mimicking pubic hair. The president denied making the note and swiftly sued the Journal.The outlet also reported that Bondi briefed Trump in May that his name appeared in the Epstein materials. The context in which Trump appeared in the files is unknown.Trump has since called for the release of grand jury testimony in the case, which a Florida judge denied.Trump also dispatched Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, his former criminal defense lawyer, to interview Maxwell in Florida where she was being held.The administration has since moved Maxwell to a Texas facility.",,,,2025-08-05 15:57:26.798468

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester for Iowa Capital Dispatch)Attorneys for the Pulitzer Prize Board are before the Florida Supreme Court trying for a delay of a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump filed after it recognized reporting about alleged collusion between his 2026 campaign and Russia.
 They want to shelve the dispute at least until Trump leaves office, pointing to a potential conflict should a state court seek to exercise authority over the nation’s top executive. The case is in Florida because Trump and one of the board members live here.
A state trial judge and the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal rejected that argument, ruling there was no need to delay adjudication of the case. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that presidents were not immune from lawsuits against themselves while in office.
Trump filed the defamation lawsuit against the Pulitzer board, the group that decides who wins Pulitzer prizes, after it bestowed a joint award in 2018 to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their reporting on alleged Russian interference in Trump’s first election.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that his investigation uncovered insufficient evidence of collusion between the Russians and Trump campaign, “despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” Mueller left unresolved whether Trump committed obstruction of justice.
At trial and before the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals, the Pulitzer board had argued the case should be dismissed or at least halted until Trump leaves office. Trump, who brought the case, argues the case should carry on. Both courts sided with Trump.
“When the president is a willing participant, courts do not risk improperly interfering with the essential functioning of government,” the the 4th DCA concluded.
“The president — by virtue of his exceptional position — is uniquely equipped to determine how to use his time, to assess the attention a lawsuit will require, and to decide whether the lawsuit will divert him from his official business. When an officeholder chooses to initiate litigation, courts must assume the officeholder already has weighed the burdens on their official duties.”

Pulitzer attorneys argue that halting the case would avoid constitutional conflicts they believe could arise from Trump serving as plaintiff in a case that could involve official acts as president.
In a Tuesday filing in the Supreme Court, Trump’s attorneys counter that the high court should decline review because the lower courts “chartered no new territory, the issues are unlikely to recur, and petitioners’ arguments are so obviously wrong.”
“The two courts below resolved Petitioners’ motion to stay the litigation against them on the not-so-novel proposition that a party generally lacks standing to assert the constitutional rights of others,” Trump’s St. Petersburg-based lawyers wrote. 
“This Court only has jurisdiction to exercise its discretionary review of a district court’s opinion when the court below ‘construes’ a constitutional provision. Since that did not occur in this case, this Court must decline review,” Trump’s attorneys wrote.

Jeff Hood describes his experiencing watching the nation's first nitrogen gas execution while testifying against HB 1489 at the Arkansas Capitol on Feb. 27, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Ten Arkansas death row prisoners filed a lawsuit Tuesday asking a judge to block a new state law that authorizes execution by nitrogen gas, which they argue is unconstitutional. 
Arkansas became the fifth state to permit this form of execution when state lawmakers approved Act 302 in March. The law took effect Tuesday. 
Supporters of the law say it will help carry out death penalty sentences. Acquiring the necessary drugs for lethal injection has been a challenge for states like Arkansas, which last conducted executions in 2017 under former Gov. Asa Hutchinson. The state executed four men over the course of a week in advance of its drug supply expiring. 
Arkansas lawmakers approve nitrogen gas execution bill, await governor’s signature

Opponents of the new law have said death by nitrogen hypoxia is experimental and inhumane. 
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of ten prisoners in Pulaski County Circuit Court Tuesday against the Arkansas Department of Corrections, the Arkansas Division of Correction, Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace and Dexter Payne, correction division director. 
In a 32-page complaint, death row inmates’ attorneys argue the new law is unconstitutional because it violates Arkansas’ separation of powers doctrine in three ways — it delegates to the corrections department and its director “absolute, unfettered discretion” to choose between lethal injection and nitrogen hypoxia, it provides no standards to constrain the use of nitrogen hypoxia and it impairs the judicial function by imposing and modifying prior sentences. 
Additionally, the complaint argues, nitrogen hypoxia for capital murder can’t be inflicted on the named death row inmates because the Legislature didn’t expressly make the law retroactive to sentences imposed before Aug. 5. The law also can’t change their punishment of death by lethal injection to death by nitrogen hypoxia without violating the state Constitution’s due process protections, according to the complaint. 
“Arkansas juries explicitly sentenced our clients to execution by lethal injection – not gas – and the General Assembly cannot rewrite those verdicts to impose death by this very different and highly problematic method,” Heather Fraley, an attorney for several of the plaintiffs, said in a press release. 
Rand Champion, DOC chief of communications, said the department has no comment at this time due to ongoing litigation. 
The death row inmates are requesting that the court declare Act 302 unconstitutional, rule that it may not be applied to them and enter an injunction barring the corrections department from carrying out nitrogen gas executions on prisoners whose crimes occurred before the law’s effective date of Aug. 5. 
There are about two dozen Arkansans currently on death row, according to the corrections department’s website.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of inmates Don Davis, Ray Dansby, Andrew Sasser, Kenneth Isom, Mickey Thomas, Thomas Springs, Zachariah Marcyniuk, Gregory Decay, Stacey Johnson and Brandon Lacy.

(Courtesy of Lorraine Backer/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public health image library)The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare issued a health advisory for harmful algal blooms for the Brownlee and Hells Canyon reservoirs.
Recent reservoir samples showed high levels of cyanobacteria that produce cyanotoxins that can harm people, pets and livestock, the state agency announced in a news release Monday. 
During the advisory, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare advises people to be cautious while recreating near or in water — such as avoiding swimming, wading or contact with the water — in the two reservoirs located in southwest Idaho.
Under Health and Welfare’s advisory: 

Children should not drink or contact reservoir water. 
Pets and livestock shouldn’t drink the water, or go in it. If pets and livestock contact the water, immediately clean their skin, hide or fur with clean water. 
Do not cook with or drink the water. Toxins aren’t removed by boiling or filtering the water, which can raise the risk of illness.
After handling fish or objects from the water, thoroughly wash hands in clean water. If you eat fish from the water, clean and wash it thoroughly in clean water. Before cooking, filet the fish and remove all internal organs, fat and skin. Cyanotoxins can build up in fish, Health and Welfare says, and human risk is unknown.

And watch for symptoms: 

People who touch or swim in the water, or breathe water droplets, might have a rash, hives, red eyes, wheezing, coughing or shortness of breath. People who swallow the water might have stomach pain, diarrhea or vomiting. People whose liver becomes damaged might have yellow skin and dark urine.
If you think you’re sick from cyanotoxin, contact your health care provider or call the poison center at 1-800-222-1222. You can also notify algae@deq.idaho.gov.
Within minutes to days after exposure to cyanotoxin, pets, livestock and wildlife can become sick or die. Dogs might get sick before humans, since they are more likely to swim in, drink or lick contaminated water or bloom material off their fur. If your pet or livestock seem sick after entering or drinking the water, immediately seek veterinary care.

Cyanobacteria are natural to Idaho’s recreational water bodies. Rising temperatures can lead to blooms that release toxins into the water.
Blooms can look different — like mats, foam, spilled paint, or surface scum with a foul odor. And they might not always be visible, such as mats on the bottom of water.

In his newly released book, “The Impertinent Question: The Words and Adventures of a Liberal Columnist at a Conservative Newspaper in the Red State of Alaska,” Fairbanks author Dan O’Neill offers some of his best columns published in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, along with other pieces published in the Anchorage Daily News and other Alaska newspapers. The News-Miner fired him in 2002. While times have indeed changed in the past quarter-century in Alaska and nationally, many of the same issues remain before us, and so speaking truth to power has not changed at all.  It still gets people fired in 2025, just as it always has. 
O’Neill sat down for an interview recently with John Creed, emeritus professor of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who taught writing and journalism for 30 years at UAF’s Chukchi College in Kotzebue. 

  Dan O’Neill is a long-time Alaska writer, former columnist, historian and journalist.

John Creed: Your new book is called The Impertinent Question. What’s it about?
 Dan O’Neill:  It starts with the fact that, until I had sufficiently irritated enough of the right people, I was a liberal columnist at a conservative newspaper, in a conservative town, in the red state of Alaska.  As you might imagine, that’s a job with a limited lifespan.  But while it lasted, it was quite exciting.  
Creed: You were sacked. Let go.
O’Neill:   Yes. The long-gone managing editor’s stated reasons were a rotating set of inconsistent and unlikely explanations.  Nothing to do with my work.  But the firing happened right after I broke the story that the university and the Army planned to launch—and crash—Scud missiles into the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. The Army quickly cancelled the project; the town and the university lost significant military spending, and that was the end of my column.  
Creed: There was some uproar over your dismissal, is that right?
O’Neill:  Yes.  One hundred-thirteen people took the trouble to write letters to the editor complaining about it, and more than 100 picketed outside the News-Miner offices.  It was a wonderful validation of the work, deeply appreciated, but it did not move the paper’s management.
Creed: So, the book collects your columns from the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, among other editorial writings.  But the pieces are not all political, not all liberal versus conservative.
O’Neill: Right.  The pieces span 40-odd years, and they range from glimpses of Alaskan outdoor life—like hunting, trapping, fishing, and dog mushing—to some of the bizarre aspects of our political environment—such as the self-styled “Corrupt Bastards Club” in the legislature and the secret missile launch that did me in.  And there are sketches of inimitable Alaska characters.
Creed: Quite a few pieces offer serious takes on political affairs or social-justice issues, as you say in the introduction—gay marriage, gun violence, policing methods, the mendacity, or dishonesty, of public figures, ideological bias in media, environmental protection versus economic development, the university’s proper role in society. 
O’Neill:  Yes, though often even the weightier ones try to grab readers with humor and to address the polemic with a light touch.  So, the pieces can be funny and contentious at the same time. Occasionally I let rip, the way you would confront a bully.
Creed: To offer this collection now, you must see these writings as still relevant.
O’Neill:  I do.  We’re still struggling to clarify the same issues. 
Creed: In the book, you set each piece up with a paragraph or so of context, often relating the earlier events to the downstream reverberations apparent to us now. There are just all kinds of similarities, aren’t there—warnings we might have heeded, reasoning we can still apply?
O’Neill:   So far, readers have consistently said that to me—that much of what I was writing about some years ago tracks quite closely with what we are facing today in the Trump era. 
Creed: I said “relevant” a minute ago, but your word is “pertinent,” or rather “impertinent.” Where does that come from?
O’Neill:  Well, my father would have called me a “s*** disturber.”  Probably he did. And I guess it’s in my bones to question authority.  Of course, that trait can be obnoxious. But it can also be usefully deployed.  It is usefully deployed by people who try to make new knowledge, whether in the sciences or the humanities or the arts.  
 A journalist probing for information that is not on offer—or that’s being withheld or misrepresented—sometimes needs to push the limits of polite behavior, like pressing an uncomfortable question upon someone in power.  The questioner needs to be skeptical of the formulaic answer—the received wisdom, the default belief system—and put the purveyors of orthodoxy on the spot.  In this way, things might be shaken up quite usefully.
To one person, the impertinent question is ill-mannered and boorish.  To another, it is “the glory and the engine of human inquiry,” as the cartoonist Gary Trudeau says in the epigraph to the book.
Creed: Speaking of cartoons, I see you drew some that are included in the book.
O’Neill: Yeah, they were published alongside the original columns.  I drew some and Dan Darrow drew some.  I’m an amateur; he’s a pro.
Creed: Your work seems something like an Alaska version of what the late syndicated columnist Molly Ivins—who often used biting humor and satire to skewer politicians—did in another big, red state: Texas.
O’Neill:  She was an amazing talent and had a long and distinguished career.  I admired her very much, but much as I’d like to, I wouldn’t try to borrow her literary luster.  But you go ahead.
Creed: The book is an excellent read.  Where can people buy it?
O’Neill:  At your local bookstore. I’ll be signing books Friday, August 8th, between 1:00 and 3:00 at Title Wave Books [1360 West Northern Lights Boulevard]. And the same day, I’ll be interviewed by Steve Heimel (retired public radio journalist), rounding out a three-writer event beginning at 6:00 at Cyrano’s Theater [3800 DeBarr Rd.]. The next day, Saturday the 9th, I’ll be signing at Fireside Books in Palmer from 1:00-4:00 pm.  The book is also available at Amazon.com, and vendors can get it through Todd Communications in Anchorage or direct from the publisher, Cirque Books.

When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.

– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive




Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
Why Republican-led states keep leaving a group that verifies voter rolls

“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
Republicans scrutinize voting rolls and ramp up for mass challenges ahead of election

The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Here’s what to know.","When wildfires burn, the smoke can travel long distances and degrade air quality far away, which presents risks for those breathing it.
Fires burning in one state can make air worse several states away, and wildfires in Canada can send smoke into U.S. cities.
Here’s what to know about taking precautions against poor air quality due to wildfires.
What counts as bad air?
The EPA’s Air Quality Index converts all pollutant levels into a single number. The lower the number, the better.
Anything below 50 is classified as “healthy.” Fifty to 100 is “moderate” while 100-150 is unhealthy for “sensitive groups,” and anything above 150 is bad for everyone.
Sensitive groups include people with asthma, lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said Dr. Sanjay Sethi, chief of the division of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Buffalo’s medical school.
“If you have heart or lung problems, then you’ve got to be definitely more careful,” Sethi said. “I would either avoid going outside or wear an N95 (mask) or at least a dust mask.”
Is my air unhealthy?
Sometimes the air is bad enough to see or smell the smoke. Even if you don’t see the pollution, it can be unhealthy to breathe.
[RELATED: The smoke from Canada’s wildfires may be even more toxic than usual]
The EPA maintains a website with up-to-date, regional air quality information. PurpleAir, a company that sells air quality sensors and publishes real-time air quality data, has a citizen scientist, air quality monitoring network with a more granular map of street-by-street air quality readings.
The best way to get indoor air quality readings is to buy a monitor, said Joseph Allen, director of Harvard University’s Healthy Buildings Program.
“You can find these low-cost, indoor air quality monitors just about everywhere online now. They don’t cost all that much anymore,” he said.
What if I have to go outside?
For most people, going outside for just a short time won’t have a negative long-term impact, said Sethi.
Wearing an N95 mask, which became common during the coronavirus pandemic, will help filter out the pollution.
“N95 is going to get rid of 90-95% of the particles,” said Jennifer Stowell, a research scientist at Boston University’s Center for Climate and Health. “If you have access to a mask that has a respirator-type attachment to it, then that’s the very best.”
If you must be outside and you experience symptoms, experts say you should head indoors or somewhere else with better air quality. Even if you are healthy, it’s good to take precautions.
“If you start wheezing, which is like this whistling sound of the chest, or if you’re feeling short of breath, that’s definitely more concerning,” Sethi said.
How do I make my air cleaner?
Close the windows and turn on the air conditioner, if you have one, setting it to circulate the indoor air. Use blankets to cover cracks that allow outside air into your home, such as under doors.
Finally, swapping the air conditioner’s filter for a MERV 13 filter can help, though you should make sure it’s installed correctly.
“If you happen to have access to an air purifier, even if it’s just a room air purifier, try to keep it running and in the room that you’re doing most of your activities in,” said Stowell.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25216673260430-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 14:56:46.496874

(Photo contributed by Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Tuesday more than $450,000 in cost share funding was awarded to nine conservation districts for water quality improvement projects. 
The Iowa Soil and Water Conservation Districts will use the funding to help private landowners implement practices like cover crops, sediment control basins, grassed waterways and other proven practices that will improve water quality in eight publicly owned lakes. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the water quality improvement efforts go toward “ensuring these lakes remain vibrant and healthy destinations.”

“We are fortunate to have some beautiful public lakes in our state that significantly enhance the quality of life for many Iowans and provide valuable recreational opportunities and wildlife habitat,” Naig said in a release. 
The announcement is part of the Publicly Owned Lakes program administered by IDALS and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. This round of funding is more than double what was allocated through the program in 2024. 
The installation of these practices up a watershed can help to keep sediment and nutrients from trickling down into Iowa lakes, which in turn, keeps the lakes cleaner and better protected for Iowans to recreate. 
Three Mile Lake had the highest allocation, of more than $133,000 to be managed by conservation districts in both Union and Adair counties. Three Mile Lake has undergone lake restoration projects for the past several years, though DNR said the restorations are considered near completion. Lake restoration projects at Casey Lake, which was also awarded funding, are also considered nearly completed.
The rest of the funding went to conservation districts monitoring the watersheds of Hawthorn Lake, Pleasant Lake, Lake Miami, 12 Mile Lake, Lake Icaria and Lake Geode. 
DNR Director Kayla Lyon said investing in public lakes is “always a sound decision.” 
“These invaluable assets offer numerous recreational opportunities, improving the well-being of countless Iowans,” Lyon said in a statement. “They also are vital economic drivers and strengthen community ties. These efforts, strengthened by the crucial cooperation of landowners within the watershed, are fundamental to ensuring these important resources remain healthy and accessible.”
Funding for the program comes from IDALS’s soil conservation cost-share budget, and the watersheds are chosen by the DNR based on priority. Landowners in the selected districts are then eligible for additional cost-share funding for water improvement projects. 
Many of the water quality improvement strategies surrounding Iowa lakes are dependent on voluntary participation by private landowners in the watersheds.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A Tuesday morning hearing in the state’s lawsuit against Washington Bridge contractors offered a crash course in legal theory, but little direction on whether the companies that worked on the bridge before its closure will have to pay.
Phrases like “economic loss doctrine” and “integrated system theory” peppered the 90-minute hearing in Rhode Island Superior Court Judge Brian Stern’s third-floor Providence courtroom. The state, represented by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General and private attorneys, contends that the 13 companies brought on to inspect, repair and maintain the westbound highway span since 2013 should be held responsible for failing to detect structural deficiencies that led to its abrupt closure in December 2023.
Lawyers for four engineering and construction vendors argue they had no contractual obligation to prevent or detect the infrastructure problems. They are asking to throw out all or parts of the state’s claims against them.
Stern did not rule on the motion Tuesday, but said he plans to make a decision by the end of the month.
A similar back-and-forth over the legal standard for the lawsuit played out earlier this year, when seven of the 13 vendors pushed to have the case tossed. Their arguments centered on a legal principle oft-invoked in construction cases known as the economic loss doctrine, which shields contractors from being sued for unspecified and foreseeable economic harms, including product damage and profit losses. 
Personal injury and damage to property beyond the product itself are the most common criteria used in successful negligence cases against construction contractors.
Stern’s Feb. 27 order rejected the first attempt by seven of the 13 contractors to toss the case, concluding there was not enough evidence to meet the high legal standard of proof to warrant such a definitive move. But he noted flaws in the state’s initial, August 2024 complaint, which failed to identify specific physical damages beyond the bridge itself. 
  If Rhode Island Superior Court Judge Brian Stern rejects contractors’ arguments, the Washington Bridge lawsuit will proceed to trial tentatively starting in November 2027. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)
The state’s amended complaint, filed in April, narrows the focus to wear and tear on the separate, eastbound bridge, which was reconfigured to accommodate Interstate 195 traffic in both directions. It again seeks damages for negligence and breach of contract by the same 13 vendors.
The 53-page updated complaint stands in direct contradiction to Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter J. Alviti’s repeated public assurances that the eastbound bridge was in “good condition” despite the increased traffic load.
Alviti’s public statements didn’t surface in court Tuesday. 
Instead, attorneys for the four vendors still seeking to throw out the complaint — Steere Engineering, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., Aries Support Services, Inc., and Commonwealth Engineers & Consultants, Inc. — referred back to the economic loss doctrine as the foundation for their arguments. 
“We still have the same fundamental deficiency,” said Michael Creta, a partner at K&L Gates in Boston representing Jacobs Engineering. “The state failed to prove other property damage to get around the economic loss doctrine.”
Creta said later, “There is nothing in the amended complaint about damage besides wear and tear, full stop.”
Warren Hutchison, an attorney with Freeman Mathis and Gary representing Steere Engineering, warned of the consequences for future contract disputes if the state can claim negligence against its contractors without proving specific physical damages.
“If we oppose the economic loss doctrine in this case, will the plaintiff ever have a remedy?” Hutchison asked.
Stephen Provazza, assistant state attorney general, countered that the weight and volume of traffic now concentrated along the eastbound bridge — necessitating more frequent repairs and intensive monitoring — met the legal standard to justify negligence. 
“The natural consequence of negligence isn’t automatically the bridge being closed,” Provazza said. “This was a sudden disaster, not something you expect when you’re sitting down to negotiate a contract.”
Attorneys for other companies named in the lawsuit attended the hearing, though they have not argued for the case to be thrown out. Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican and an attorney who represents Vanasse Hanglin Brustlin in the lawsuit, said in an interview after the hearing that if Stern sided with the contractors, he would piggyback on their motion on behalf of his client.
Stern offered little indication of how he will decide, interjecting periodically to ask for clarification from the attorneys who spoke. If he rejects the contractors’ arguments for a second time, the lawsuit will proceed down the long and winding road to trial, with a tentative schedule proposing a six-to-eight-week trial starting in November 2027 — one year before the expected completion date of the new, westbound Washington Bridge.
“One thing the court is wrestling with: At what point should the court deal with this, versus letting it develop a record and maybe it will deal with itself,” Stern said.
The Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday.

The company said in a filing with the PSC in October that it needs roughly 1,200 megawatts in new power capacity by the end of the decade, due in part to the growth of data centers. The utility estimates that it will have surplus capacity until 2028.
This would be the third Alabama Power rate increase that the company imposed on its customers since 2020. The company acquired other power plants in 2020 and 2022 and increased the rate by $5 per month to pay for the cost of those purchases.

Alabama Power said in a statement on Tuesday that the decision reinforces the company’s commitment to deliver dependable energy to Alabama.
“Adding Lindsay Hill’s strong track record of reliable power to our generation mix will strengthen our ability to meet the growing needs of our state so we can economically produce the electricity our customers count on,” Alabama Power said. “Customers will not see any impact on their bills from this facility until mid-2027.”

“Alabama Power’s five-year gas grab burdens families with higher bills and highlights the utility’s failure to consider cheaper and cleaner alternatives,” said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, in a statement.
“Alabama families deserve better than approving polluting power plants without proof they’re absolutely necessary,” said Jilisa Milton, director of Greater-Brimingham Alliance to Stop Pollution (GASP), in a statement.

(Photo: NCCCS) The North Carolina Community College System will soon embark on a search for its fifth new president in roughly six years. Current president, Dr. Jeff Cox, announced plans to retire from the position at the end of the fiscal year in June 2026.
Cox became the 11th president of the 58-campus system in June 2023, having served as the president of Wilkes Community College for nine years.
In announcing his departure, Cox called the presidency the greatest honor of his career.
“As a first-generation college student from rural Alleghany County, I could never have imagined that one day I would lead the state’s community college system. Our colleges play a pivotal role in changing the lives of 600,000+ students every year,” Cox said in a prepared statement.
Cox is credited with overseeing the early implementation of Propel NC, a new model for funding North Carolina’s community colleges that prioritizes connecting students to high-demand, high-wage jobs.
The system also credits Cox with strengthening partnerships with K-12 schools and universitiesto help drive a statewide enrollment recovery. Enrollment at public two-year colleges jumped 8.3% this Spring compared to a year earlier.
Over the past year, Cox had Hurricane Helene recovery added to his plate. The storm impacted nearly 74,000 students and more than 6,000 faculty and staff.
State Board of Community Colleges Chair Tom Looney acknowledged Cox’s steady hand and long-term impact.
“Dr. Cox stepped up at a critical moment and brought much-needed stability and experience to the system, serving with heart,” Looney said.
Cox plans to depart in 10 months, hoping that his early notice provides the State Board with adequate time to conduct a comprehensive search to find the next system president.
Indeed, North Carolina’s community college system has found it challenging to hold on to its leaders.
Cox was preceded in the position by Thomas Stith, former chief of staff to Gov. Pat McCrory. His appointment in December 2020 was considered to be a popular choice among conservative leaders in the state. But after just 18 months in the role, Stith resigned abruptly leaving William Carver to serve as the system’s interim president.
Prior to Stith, the role was held for three years by Peter Hans. Hans was lured away to become president of the UNC System, a position he has held since the summer of 2020.
The 58-campus system is viewed as a critical component in helping the state meet its educational attainment goal of having two million North Carolinians with a degree or industry credential beyond high school by 2030.
When Cox took the helm, he said it was a crisis that 30-40% of the state’s high school graduates were not pursuing a post-secondary degree.
Today, North Carolina’s post-secondary completion rate for students who began at a 2-year public institution is 50%.
“Finish Line Grants” have helped bolster that number in recent years by aiding students on the cusp of graduating with housing, medical needs, and other unforeseen financial challenges.
The State Board of Community Colleges will outline its formal transition process in the coming months. This will likely include the hiring of a national search firm with expertise in higher education. While the State Board can select its finalist for the position, the General Assembly will have the final say.
Legislators often credit the North Carolina Community College System with helping the state keep its top ranking for business and helping recruit new industry.
A 2022 study found that combined the 58 college campuses have a $19 billion annual impact on the state’s economy and support 1 out of every 19 jobs across North Carolina.
 In June, the system along with Guilford Technical Community College announced plans to tailor a new curriculum for the future workforce of JetZero.

Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.

Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
You’ve covered your copayment; now brace yourself for the ‘facility fee’

But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

(Photo courtesy Norris campaign)Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris became the latest candidate to join the race for U.S. Senate Tuesday, saying she wants to focus on family issues like child care, education and housing.
Norris, a Democrat, has a long history in politics, both in Washington, D.C., and Iowa. She worked as chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama and for a nonprofit run by former President George H.W. Bush, as well as on the campaigns of former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack and former President Barack Obama. Now, she is chair of the Des Moines school board and president of Horizon Group, a market research and consulting firm.
Her choice to run for Senate came largely from her experiences outside of politics, Norris said in an interview, from her time as a school board member, and formerly as a teacher and as the CEO of Goodwill of Central Iowa.

“I’ve seen firsthand the invisible burdens that families are carrying right now,” Norris said. “It is so hard for our young people, when government cuts programs for hungry kids, when it’s harder to access children’s health care, and (when) child care workers are paid, you know, not enough and have to work two jobs to take care of our young people. Government has turned its back on families. And the red versus blue politics and yelling is not working right now. It’s not getting anything done, and quite honestly, nobody’s held accountable.”
Norris said she is able to offer a new vision as a candidate who is “not afraid to get out there and say what I think, roll up my sleeves and fight, have the grit, take my experiences and get things done in the U.S. Senate.”
Norris is competing for the Democratic nomination against state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville; state Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, and the former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage for the party nomination. Other candidates may also join the race — the Des Moines Register reported state Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, is also preparing to announce a bid for the seat in August.
But Norris said she is uniquely positioned as a strong contender for the job, with extensive experience in fields like education and community service, as well as working directly with both Democrats and Republicans.
If elected to the U.S. Senate, Norris said she is prepared to find ways to work with President Donald Trump and Republicans in order to accomplish meaningful policies.
“Americans are going to believe in government again if they actually see us putting them ahead of our party loyalties. And look, in Iowa, Trump was elected, and so, I’m going to work with whatever strange bedfellows I need to, to accomplish good things for Iowa. So whether that’s addressing some of the uncertainty with our tariffs, whether that’s making sure we restore health access to our veterans … that is what people should expect of us, is that we are not just yelling at each other, but we’re actually getting things done for them.”
The seat is currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican. Ernst has not announced whether she is running for reelection in 2026, though she hired a campaign manager and has received encouragement from GOP leadership to seek another term.
Ernst had gained national attention in May for her comment “well, we all are going to die” at a town hall when responding to a person who said Medicaid cuts included in the budget reconciliation bill would result in deaths. Norris said this statement was “troubling,” as was her decision to confirm U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
While the Iowa Republican has been criticized from the right for expressing concerns about Hegseth during the nomination process, she ultimately voted to confirm him. But Norris said Ernst’s vote to support Hegseth shows a “loss of integrity,” as Ernst, a combat veteran and survivor of sexual assault, has been a major advocate for making changes to how the U.S. military works with women in the service and handles sexual assault cases.
Hegseth has been accused of sexual assault, as well as facing other allegations about public intoxication and corporate mismanagement.
“I’m a military mom, I appreciate and respect her commitment to service, but when you cut programs to the very veterans you’ve served beside, I think you’ve lost your way,” Norris said of Ernst. “And if you stay silent when women in uniform are disrespected by the secretary of Defense, I think you’ve lost your way.”
Norris said Iowans can expect to see her in the coming months holding roundtable discussions and having conversations about issues like health care and child care affordability with the people impacted by recent policies.
“Most importantly, what I think you’re going to see from me is hard work, listening and getting out there and taking a few risks and talking about the things that are really important to people,” Norris said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)State officials have received thousands of complaints related to residential construction fraud in the last several years, a problem the Utah Department of Commerce says has cost residents a combined $32 million.  
On Monday, the state announced a new task force bringing together officials from the department, the attorney general’s office, lawmakers, industry representatives and law enforcement to fight the growing problem, which experts say is a byproduct of the state’s rapid growth and new construction. 
Residential construction fraud is a broad term that can include contractors not finishing work they were paid to do, false invoicing (when contractors submit invoices for work they didn’t do), manipulating the bidding process, or lying about qualifications or licenses.

According to the Utah Insurance Department, roofing companies have been known to canvas neighborhoods after a storm or disaster offering a free inspection, only to intentionally damage or misrepresent the extent of damage to a home. Plumbers might refer homeowners to a mitigation company to inspect water damage, ask the homeowner to sign a contract up front, then recommend repairs that go beyond the homeowner’s insurance coverage. 
Those are just a few examples of the schemes that, according to the Division of Consumer Protection, are costing Utahns millions. During new construction, the division says these schemes can result in an average loss of $302,000 per customer. 
In 2024, the Utah Division of Professional Licensing received at least 2,146 construction-related complaints; so far this year, it’s already processed 1,047 additional complaints. In three years, Utahns have lost a combined $32 million stemming from construction-related complaints, the division says. 
The task force announced this week will be composed of various law enforcement officers, industry representatives, prosecutors, officials from the Utah Divisions of Professional Licensing and Consumer Protection, the Utah Attorney General’s Office, Sen. Cal Musselman, R-West Haven, and Rep. Thomas Peterson, R-Brigham City. 
“As a building official by profession, I’ve seen firsthand how construction fraud erodes the very foundation of trust essential for a stable housing market in Utah,” said Peterson in a statement. The Brigham City Republican currently works for the state as a building official with the Utah Division of Facilities Construction and Management, according to his conflict of interest form. 
“Construction fraud is a direct threat to our efforts to put homeownership back in reach for our kids and grandkids,” said Musselman, who works in real estate sales and management, in a statement. 
The task force will focus on “aggressive” enforcement of Utah fraud laws, using the state’s dedicated construction fraud prosecutor. It will also launch an education and outreach campaign to “equip consumers with guides and best practices, provide compliance training for industry professionals, and train local prosecutors to handle construction fraud cases effectively.”

And, the task force will consider regulatory reform, researching laws in other states, collaborate with industry groups, identify gaps in Utah code and draft new rules for state regulators. 
“The Task Force’s work to root out construction fraud is an essential piece to bringing affordable housing to Utah,” said Steve Waldrip, the governor’s senior advisor for housing, strategy, and innovation, in a statement. “It fosters the trust needed for people to confidently hire quality contractors, especially when investing in and improving older, more affordable homes.”
The Department of Commerce also recently created a new Utah Residential Construction Agreement, a contract template for homeowners and contractors intended to define project details and expectations, and protect against fraud. 
The agreement is “designed to empower homeowners and licensed professionals. This resource can be used to fill in the blanks for a new agreement or as a comprehensive point of reference to ensure an existing contract is solid.”

Rhodes will retire after the 2025-26 school year. (Photo provided by Putnam City Public Schools)OKLAHOMA CITY — Another superintendent from one of Oklahoma’s largest school districts is set to depart, with longtime Putnam City Public Schools leader Fred Rhodes announcing his retirement.
Rhodes will bring his 50-year career in public education to an end after the 2025-26 school year. He made his announcement Monday evening at a school board meeting in the northwest Oklahoma City district.
Rhodes will be the latest superintendent departure among Oklahoma’s largest public school systems. Edmond Public Schools, Yukon Public Schools, Tulsa Union Public Schools and Bixby Public Schools each have had their superintendents retire in the past year while the state’s three largest districts — Tulsa Public Schools, Oklahoma City Public Schools and Epic Charter School — also experienced leadership changes in recent years.
The school board of Putnam City, Oklahoma’s seventh-largest district, accepted Rhodes’ retirement. It will take effect July 1, 2026.
Rhodes has led the district of 18,800 students since 2013. His 13 years in charge will make him one of the longest-tenured superintendents in Putnam City’s 112-year history, according to a district news release. 
The Putnam City school board will contract with the Oklahoma State School Boards Association to help search for Rhodes’ successor, the release states.
In a retirement letter addressed to the school board, Rhodes wrote that he was “professionally born” in Putnam City when he started there as a student teacher in 1976.
Later that same year, the district hired him full-time to teach at Wiley Post Elementary. At the time, Wiley Post used an open-school concept that featured large communal learning areas and few interior walls.

Rhodes said he “loved absolutely everything about” the school’s unique structure. He taught there for four years and then became the school’s assistant principal. 
After working as an assistant principal at Dennis Elementary, Rhodes was hired as the inaugural principal at Will Rogers Elementary when the school opened in 1983. He remained there for 22 years.
“I loved Will Rogers so much, I actually thought that was where I would be when I retired,” Rhodes wrote. “But, Someone else had a different plan.”
In 2005, Rhodes moved into the central office administration in Yukon, where he became an award-winning assistant superintendent.
The Putnam City school board hired him back in 2013, this time as superintendent, a position he “enthusiastically accepted.” 
Rhodes’ letter didn’t specify why this year was the right one to retire. Instead, he thanked current and former members of the Putnam City school board, as well as the district’s community, “for allowing me to serve as the 24th superintendent of the premier public school system in the state of Oklahoma.”
“By working together, for a common cause, we have accomplished great things for, most importantly, the students,” Rhodes wrote.

(Eliza Blanning)“You belong. We belong” reads the sign posted above the secure entrance to CoreCivic’s Cibola County Correctional Center, a privately-owned immigrant detention center in Milan, New Mexico. The sign continues: “We foster a welcoming culture where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, contributions are valued, and people are equipped for success.”
These sentiments are a stark contrast to the three rows of barbed wire and electric fencing that surround the entire facility, and to the purposeful placement of windows and doors that prevent people detained inside from seeing the sun. The sign is corporate propaganda, designed to hide the immense isolation, hopelessness, fear and psychological torture taking place just beyond the gates. Cibola County Correctional Center is not a detention center. It is a prison. It is one of many private prisons around the country designed to profit off of human suffering. The immigration system in the U.S. is not about law and justice; it is about racial prejudice and abuse of power.
Working as a summer intern at New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, I had the chance to work closely on the case of a man detained at Cibola. This man told me about growing up in Venezuela without public services, medication and reliable institutions, and how that thrust him into political advocacy and opposition to oppressive government policies. He related the first time he was violently threatened by the Maduro regime when he sought a free and fair election, and how he felt as he watched armed guards steal the presidential election ballot boxes and manipulate the results to keep Nicolás Maduro in power.
Soon after, as the man stood in the street with millions of others awaiting the election results, he was struck by a tear-gas bomb from the National Guard and lost consciousness. By the time he woke up, he had been detained by the National Guard in one of their bases. They tortured him to make him unlock his phone, and then tortured him even more brutally after they found on his phone evidence of his opposition. They beat him so badly that he temporarily lost his vision. He and several others were then taken to the city landfill, where they were told to kneel with their backs facing the guards. They were then executed. He was the only survivor. The bullet from when he was shot is still lodged in his chest. Since the massacre took place in the landfill, the guards didn’t even have to move the bodies.
After fleeing Venezuela, the bullet wound still fresh, this man traveled through seven different countries on his way to the U.S. In Mexico, he was kidnapped and trafficked by a cartel, forced to work long days on a mango farm with minimal water and no food. His family had to pay thousands of dollars in ransom to free him. When he was finally freed, he was left alone in a plaza in Mexico and threatened with death and torture should he ever tell the authorities what had happened.
He fled to the U.S./Mexico border, seeking refuge. He turned himself in to the Border Patrol, believing he had come to a land of law and justice. Instead, he has spent nearly nine months imprisoned, without adequate food, medical care or any legal representation. He fears for his family. They have been threatened and cut off from government benefits, including food, but do not have the funds to leave Venezuela.
Given multiple asylum bans at the border across multiple presidential administrations, this man may very well be denied asylum protection — despite the immense harm he has suffered in his home country and all along the route to the United States.
The immigration system does not exist in a vacuum; it is not its own entity. It is a thread in a tapestry of oppression — a cog in a machine designed to oppress and to profit off of the suffering it creates, leaving thousands of separated families and broken hearts in its wake. The U.S. immigration system is primordial evil disguised behind a veil of nationalism and prejudice pandered to the public eye as valiant patriotism.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CibolaCorrectionalElizaBlanning-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-05 15:57:26.798468

Pete Ricketts, U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, Rep. Mike Flood and Lincoln Chamber of Commerce CEO Jason Ball speak at a federal legislative summit at Nebraska's Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum in Ashland, Neb. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)ASHLAND, Neb. — Nebraska’s congressional delegates spoke optimistically about federal policies helping the state’s economic future, despite some warning signs that Nebraska’s agricultural industry is struggling.
Three of Nebraska’s federal representatives — U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, Sen. Pete Ricketts and Rep. Mike Flood — shared their thoughts Tuesday at a summit hosted by a collaboration of three of Nebraska’s largest chambers of commerce. Reps. Don Bacon and Adrian Smith did not attend. Bacon was out of town, and Smith’s flight was delayed out of Scottsbluff, though both sent video messages.
All five said good things about the federal budget reconciliation bill that passed in early July, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Ricketts said the bill is “fantastic for families,” because it prevents potential tax increases. He estimated the changes would increase families’ average annual income between $4,000 and $7,000 over the next three years.

Fischer said the bill also includes some safety measures for Nebraska’s agricultural businesses that normally would have been included in the federal farm bill, which has yet to pass. These include improved trade promotion authority and better disaster aid for farmers, she said.
Their optimism comes at a time of increasing reservations about the economy, both nationally and in Nebraska. The U.S. Labor Department just released a jobs report that erased roughly 258,000 that previous reports had estimated were added in May and June, reducing the job growth to about 19,000 new jobs in May and 14,000 jobs in June.
Additionally, Nebraska’s Gross Domestic Product dropped more than 6% during the first quarter of 2025 , according to a report from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The report largely blamed the loss on a slowdown in the state’s ag industry.
Some have argued that President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff tactics have introduced uncertainty that hinders Nebraska businesses. But Flood said there were signs of a slowdown in Nebraska agriculture that predate Trump’s second administration. He said he expressed these worries at the chamber’s summit last year.
“We’ve seen this coming for the better part of a year,” Flood said.

At the time, Flood’s concerns were rooted in Nebraska’s ongoing drought, but he said former President Joe Biden also shared some of the blame. Smith has argued previously that Biden did too little to promote agricultural trade.
Part of the explanation lies in price drops in popular Nebraska row crops like corn and soybeans. Both Ricketts and Bacon said as much, and Ricketts said the budget reconciliation bill should help farmers by doubling U.S. investments in trade promotion and increasing opportunities for Nebraska farmers overseas.
  U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb. (Courtesy of Ricketts campaign)
The summit’s keynote speaker Rodney Davis, a former Illinois congressman and head of government affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, defended Trump’s tariff strategy. He speculated that Trump is taking a more aggressive approach for “leverage,” and guessed that if it causes too much economic pain Trump will be quick to change his direction.
“When you have leverage, you can make things better,” Davis said.
Even Smith, who acknowledged he isn’t the biggest fan of tariffs in his video message, said Trump’s policies have “leveled the playing field” internationally. Ricketts said allied countries like Australia and the United Kingdom have increased their purchases of U.S. exports because of these policies.
Fischer shared similar thoughts, saying that though tariffs make people “nervous,” Trump’s approach has forced trade conversations where there previously weren’t any. She claimed members of Nebraska’s agricultural community said they are willing to give Trump time to enact these policies to see what benefits can be gained.
  U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb. (Courtesy of Flood campaign)
This differs from the perspective of John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, who has said the U.S. is facing the worst farming financial crisis since the 1980s. He said he’s been fielding calls to a crisis hotline for farmers that he helps operate, where people have shared their financial struggles.
Though he has sympathy for tariff policies, he said they have to be done carefully and expressed reservations about now being the right time to act so aggressively.
“There’s desperation in their voices,” Hansen said of the crisis calls he’s received. “They’re up against the wall.”
While Flood said he doesn’t believe Trump’s tariffs are contributing to Nebraska’s agricultural slowdown, he hopes the president’s negotiations will wrap up by Christmas. He noted that for businesses to thrive, they need certainty and predictability in federal policies.
“Certainty is what I crave,” Flood said.

Free.,Trump pledges overhaul of school fitness tests,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-pledges-overhaul-school-fitness-tests,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is bringing back a physical fitness test to public schools after over a decade, but details of the new test, including timing and implementation, remain to be seen.Trump signed an executive order July 31 that reestablished the Presidential Fitness Test — a source of both fear and achievement among youth — and committed to revitalizing the “President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition,” which would develop the test.“Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity, and poor nutrition are at crisis levels, particularly among our children,” the executive order notes. “These trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic performance, and national morale.”The president designated Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to administer the test.

The council is tasked with creating “school-based programs that reward excellence in physical education and develop criteria for a Presidential Fitness Award,” according to a White House fact sheet.Expert hopes for ‘holistic’ revampThe order did not provide any details on what the test will look like or how or when it will roll out.Laura Richardson, a clinical associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Michigan, said she hoped to see an updated version of the test that focused more on level of activity than on a student’s performance.“I’m hopeful that maybe it will be reevaluated and revised and really have some tools that don’t just look at how fast you are or how strong you are, but more holistic in the tools we need to get our children to be active in childhood that should then continue through the trajectory into adulthood,” Richardson told States Newsroom.Richardson added that testing alone would not be sufficient to see improvement in kids’ physical fitness, and called for increasing resources to schools to help students be more active.“Sedentary behavior is really widespread — we’re seeing increasing obesity among all ages,” Richardson told States Newsroom. “We can test ... but if we’re not giving the tools to the teachers and the students and the parents, we may continue to see the same data.”Bill would codify testRep. Jeff Van Drew announced last week that he will introduce a bill to codify Trump’s executive order.In a statement, the New Jersey Republican said he coordinated with the administration, including Kennedy, when writing the bill.“Every parent wants their kid to grow up strong and healthy,” he added. “This bill is about making sure they are given the tools to do just that.”Latest version of testThe Presidential Fitness Test dates back to President Dwight Eisenhower, who set up the President’s Council on Youth Fitness in 1956 following alarming findings on the state of youth fitness in the United States compared to youth in European nations.The test initially included sit-ups, a mile run, a shuttle run, pull-ups or push-ups and a sit-and-reach, according to Harvard Health.Since then, the test has seen several versions. The most recent major revamp was in 2012, when President Barack Obama’s administration replaced the Presidential Fitness Test with the Presidential Youth Fitness Program, which aimed for a more individualized and health-focused approach.The program, which came after criticism of the Presidential Fitness Test and concerns about its psychological effects on youth, aimed to minimize “comparisons between children and instead supports students as they pursue personal fitness goals for lifelong health,” according to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion within the Department of Health and Human Services. President John F.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-05 17:43:31+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump EPA says it will defend tough lead pipe rule from Biden, but details to come",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/05/trump-epa-lead-pipes/,The Environmental Protection Agency announced it would defend strict rules to reduce lead in drinking water.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday it will defend the Biden administration’s aggressive rule for reducing lead in drinking water against a court challenge, though public health advocates worry officials could still weaken it.
The rule gave cities and towns a 10-year deadline to replace all of their lead pipes and was the strongest overhaul of lead-in-water standards in roughly three decades. Litigation against the rule was on pause so the Trump administration could decide whether it supported the policy. On Tuesday, the agency said it would defend the tough standards.
“At the same time, EPA will develop new tools and information to support practical implementation flexibilities and regulatory clarity. The agency will announce next steps in the coming months,” the agency said.
Lead, a heavy metal once common in products like pipes and paints, is a neurotoxin that can lower IQ scores in children, stunt their development and increase blood pressure in adults. Lead pipes can corrode and contaminate drinking water. The previous Trump administration’s rule had looser standards and did not mandate the replacement of all pipes.

Jared Thompson, a senior attorney with the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council that supports the Biden-era rule, said he doesn’t know what the EPA means with terms like “practical implementation flexibility.”
“The concern is that, are they going to try to use that to create some sort of loopholes that would allow water systems to not fully comply with the rule, or will they actually proceed with full implementation,” he said. “We just don’t know at this point.”
He said he’s also concerned with the Trump administration’s earlier proposal to significantly cut funding for local water infrastructure. The EPA has said there are programs and resources available to ensure lead pipe replacement projects proceed smoothly and cost-effectively.
The agency asked a D.C. federal appeals court on Monday to resume the case. It wants to file its arguments with the court in early December.
The EPA under President Donald Trump has celebrated deregulation. Officials have sought to slash climate change programs and promote fossil fuel development. On drinking water issues, however, their initial actions have been more nuanced.
In March, for example, the EPA announced plans to partially roll back rules to reduce so-called “forever chemicals” in drinking water — the other major Biden-era tap water protection. That change, however, sought to keep tough limits for some common PFAS. It also proposed scrapping and reconsidering standards for other types and extending deadlines.
PFAS and lead pipes are both costly threats to safe water. There are roughly 9 million lead pipes providing water to homes and businesses in the United States.
The American Water Works Association, a utility industry association, had challenged the lead rule, saying utilities should not be responsible for the portion of the lead pipe that is on private property. They also described the 10-year deadline as “not feasible.”
The Biden-era regulation required water systems to ensure that lead concentrations do not exceed an “action level” of 10 parts per billion, down from 15 parts per billion under the previous standard. If high lead levels are found, water systems must inform the public about ways to protect their health, including the use of water filters, and take action to reduce lead exposure while working to replace all lead pipes.
Lead pipes are most commonly found in older, industrial parts of the country, including major cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Detroit and Milwaukee. The rule also revises the way lead amounts are measured, which could significantly expand the number of communities found violating the rules.
Water utilities were given three years to prepare before the 10-year timeframe starts. And some cities with a lot of lead will have longer.
The EPA estimated at the time officials issued the stricter standards that they would protect up to 900,000 infants from having low birth weight and avoid up to 1,500 premature deaths a year from heart disease.
The original lead and copper rule for drinking water was enacted by the EPA more than 30 years ago. The rules have significantly reduced lead in tap water but have included loopholes that allowed cities to move slowly when lead levels rose too high.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP18208606021192-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-08-05 13:57:28.091339

A new study found that hospitals are increasingly buying up private physician-owned practices, and costs for services are rising. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
You’ve covered your copayment; now brace yourself for the ‘facility fee’

But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

This article was first published by The 19th.
When Liuba Grechen Shirley ran for Congress in 2018, she began a journey that helped change federal policy to ensure parents like herself could use campaign funds to pay for child care.
The Democrat has been public about her struggles with balancing a campaign and securing child care. Less known was the harassment and threats of violence that Grechen Shirley says she experienced at the time. Her car window was smashed, and anonymous calls popped up at her daughter’s nursery school, which was listed on public records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).
“There were people who called and harassed the nursery school because they could find that that’s where I was spending money,” she said.
None of this deterred Grechen Shirley’s run for office, an ultimately unsuccessful bid but one that launched years of advocacy to make sure candidates at all levels of elected office could use campaign dollars for child care expenses. To date, 40 states allow its use, a recent milestone that’s taken years due to the nation’s patchwork of laws and regulations.
Now Vote Mama — the umbrella organization Grechen Shirley founded that supports parents who run for office — is elevating the use of campaign funds for security measures. Its lobbying entity has begun advocating for policies on the state level that ensure parents and others with concerns about the safety of their families have more financial means to protect themselves.
The organization’s research arm, Vote Mama Foundation, released a report on Monday that shows federal candidates are increasingly spending money on security. While the expenditures do not focus on parents, the report’s findings conclude that the increase in spending indicates a dwindling sense of safety for candidates, which “creates a barrier to entry for caregivers seeking office and discourages a new generation of candidates with young families from running for office up and down the ballot nationwide.”
The possibility that parents might forgo such political engagement is likely to impact their already limited representation in elected office: Vote Mama Foundation has collected data on mothers with minor children and estimated that they are just 8 percent of state legislators. They represent just 6.8 percent of all federal legislators.
“Campaign funds for child care opens the door for more moms to run and to serve in office, but campaign funds for security — it keeps that door open, by ensuring safety shouldn’t be a deterrent for people who want to run for elected office,” Grechen Shirley said.
Federal candidates had been able to use campaign funds for security expenses on a case-by-case basis since 2009, but an FEC rule in 2024 clarified the use of such funds for the reasonable cost of security measures for a federal candidate, federal officeholder, member of their family and employees. Among the buckets of allowable expenses:

Security devices such as hardware, locks, alarm systems, motion detectors and security camera systems;
Structural security devices such as wiring, lighting, gates, doors and fencing;
Security personnel;
Cyber security software, devices and services.

Vote Mama Foundation, which appears to be the only organization tracking security spending, analyzed security-related transactions in FEC filings between 2014 and 2024. It estimated more than 860 candidates for federal office spent over $41 million on security measures during that time — with 2020 and 2024 accounting for nearly half of all spending.
The bulk of the federal spending on security — 78 percent — was done by men, and nearly 80 percent of that amount was spent by White men. While women represent just 22 percent of security spending, women of color make up 63 percent of that amount — nearly two-thirds.
While the Vote Mama report focuses on federal campaign spending, Grechen Shirley said the new data connects the dots on the shortcomings of state-level policy, which will need to play out individually. North Dakota recently became the 10th state to allow for spending campaign funds on candidate safety — and the first since the June assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her spouse. Lawmakers in Oklahoma have recently returned to the subject, and the Minnesota legislature now plans to cover costs for enhanced home security for lawmakers.
Vote Mama is calling on more states to allow campaign expenditures in order to empower more parents to run for and stay in office. It notes such policies should come at no expense to taxpayers since candidates would be using the money they’re raising.
Reports of harassment and threats of violence against elected officials and candidates have become more common. Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI), a nonpartisan research initiative out of Princeton University that tracks and mitigates political violence in the United States, maintains a public dataset that shows more than 250 incidents of threats and harassment targeting local officials have been reported in the first half of 2025 — up 9 percent from this point in 2024.
BDI, in partnership with the organization CivicPulse, also maintains a quarterly survey of local elected officials, and its latest findings show many officials are seeking more safety support, including for personal security and enhanced privacy protections. One in 3 women reported their gender identity as a perceived driver of the hostility they faced, compared to just 1 in 50 men.
Among recent interviews with elected officials, BDI staff say there are elected officials who are mothers who have indicated they do not plan to run for higher office explicitly because they fear the safety risks to their children. Others say they plan to wait until their kids are young adults. Some of these mothers already have safety strategies in place to limit what information they share publicly about having kids.
Shannon Hiller, executive director of BDI, said almost half of all women in the survey report that they worry about threats, harassment or attacks in the future — that’s the case for about a third of men.
“This is not just only a problem for women, but it’s important to note that this sort of climate is impacting certain types of officials even more than others,” she said.
The issue reached renewed attention following the death of Hortman and her spouse in a shooting at multiple private residences that also injured Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his spouse. The alleged gunman, who reportedly had a “hit list” of multiple Democrats besides Hortman and Hoffman, has been arrested.
That follows an alleged arson at the official residence of Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro in the spring, and years of attempted attacks and threats of violence against others. Last year, after President Donald Trump was shot in the ear in an assasination attempt at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, the incident drew public condemnation from women who have been targets of political violence.
“No one should have to risk their lives to serve in office, to stand up and fight for their constituents,” Grechen Shirley said.
Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, noted that running for the legislature or local office is often a low-paying part-time job, even though the public expectations can make it feel like a full-time gig. That already made it a tough sell for women candidates, especially those with young children, who must now contend with safety concerns that disproportionately impact them.
“Women make up less than a third of elected officials at any level of office. If it has a chilling effect on women running for office or running for reelection, we’re at risk of losing women’s voices,” she said. “When you lose women’s voices in these decision-making bodies — where policy is made that affects all of our lives — then you think about our democracy, it really puts in many ways our democracy at risk.”
Security spending is used across the political spectrum. From 2014 to 2024, Democrats spent more than $18 million, and Republicans spent more than $14 million. Trump spent $6.8 million on security measures, according to the report. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran for president last election cycle before being tapped to be health secretary, spent $5.7 million.
Former Vice President Kamala Harris spent $1.7 million on security. In Congress, former Sen. Krysten Sinema spent $1.4 million, followed by former Rep. Cori Bush with $831,000 and Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez with $666,000.
Grechen Shirley said there is bipartisan support for addressing security concerns among elected lawmakers and candidates.
“Both Democrats and Republicans are getting threats. This is something that is common sense, and it’s already approved at the federal level,” she said. “Now we have to get this approved at the state level to make sure that people are safe.”
In a recent policy brief with the Brennan Center for Justice, BDI called for expanded access on the state-level for personal security measures and data collection on the issue. The brief also noted the Trump administration’s rollback of security protections for former officials and the president’s clemency of nearly 1,600 participants convicted in the January 6 attack on the Capitol has “created a more permissive environment for politically motivated attacks.”
Hiller said that context is important if the public wants to better understand how to address political violence.
“People have to be thinking about holding their elected leaders accountable if they’re contributing to that kind of climate and permissive environment around threats and harassment in particular,” she said.

Photo by Jon King.Nearly a dozen University of Michigan students and alumni have been brought up on disciplinary charges for their participation in pro-Palestine protests over the last year – a move that has sparked concern for the right of free expression on campus and the over-policing of student protest movements.
The university’s Board of Regents is currently in the process of holding disciplinary hearings against 11 protesters, including leaders from Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, the Muslim Student Association, Arab Students Association, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Graduate Employees Organization, a branch of AFT Local 3550.
At least four of those individuals faced criminal charges lodged by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel for trespassing or resisting arrest when police cleared a protest encampment from the university in May 2024. Those charges were dismissed in May of this year.

The university’s regents, however, are still seeking formal reprimands, disciplinary probation and suspension in abeyance against student protesters. For alumni facing disciplinary action, the university is considering a lifetime ban from all future U of M activity, including reenrollment.
Kathleen Brown is a graduate student and a member of AFT Local 3550. She is one of the current 11 students and alumni facing ongoing disciplinary action through the university’s Office of Student Conflict Resolution. Brown is also among the third round of students facing disciplinary action related to Gaza and Palestinian solidarity protest movements at U of M.
For her, the hearings and potential consequences feel more like punishment for political dissent than the university’s stated goal of protecting students and the larger institution, especially after the state dropped the criminal charges.
“Those did not stick because protesting is not yet a crime, so now, they’re getting us on these disciplinary charges, which have a much lower burden of proof,” Brown said. “The university can allege anything and can basically punish us with anything. There’s no due process in this.”
The university has said that the right to free speech and expression is protected, but claimed the Palestine protests were disruptive, compromised operations and infringed on the rights of others at U of M.
Michigan AG confirms warrant sweep was connected to ‘coordinated criminal acts of vandalism’

In an email to the Advance, Kay Jarvis, U of M’s director of public affairs, added that protests are welcomed as long as those protests do not threaten the safety of the university community.
“The university has been clear that we will enforce our policies related to protests and expressive activity, and that we will hold individuals accountable for their actions in order to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all,” Jarvis said.
When asked to confirm the current disciplinary action against the 11 students, Jarvis said the university does not comment on individual cases due to confidentiality and privacy concerns.
All disciplinary actions go through the Office of Student Conflict Resolution, detailed in the university’s statement of student rights and responsibilities, and are typically resolved within six months after receiving a formal complaint. That timeframe can be extended, though, to allow resolutions through “external proceedings,” although Jarvis did not say what that might entail.
The proceedings have stemmed from several protests, including a sit-in at a university administration building just a month after the Israeli military assault on Gaza began, which was launched in retaliation to the militant group Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel that killed more than a thousand Israelis and took more than 250 hostages. The resulting Israeli military response has killed more than 60,000 people according to Gaza’s health ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government.
Other protests have included an action outside a regents gala and the break up of the encampment in the university’s Diag area, both in May 2024, and a memorial march on the one year anniversary of the latest conflict, which is more frequently being described as a genocide of the Palestinian people.

Brown is facing the lighter side of potential consequences with a formal reprimand planned. She said she and others have already been subject to several hearings over the protests and that they will continue for her this month.
In her view, the proceedings are a way to make student protesters pay for standing in solidarity with Palestinians and other oppressed groups. 
In previous proceedings with two separate groups of students punished on disciplinary grounds, the Office of Student Conflict Resolution found that the complaints were unsubstantiated, but Brown said the university’s student office overturned that finding and sanctioned the students anyway.
“Any avenue they can pursue, the administration is pursuing, with no respect for our constitutional rights,” Brown said.
Several lawsuits, including one in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, have been filed against the university as a result of the disciplinary action of student protesters. One is focused on the university’s decision to still seek sanctions against students after the institution cleared them of disciplinary charges.
Brown said the university was making an example of these students due to the politically controversial nature of the Palestinian solidarity movement.
“Anything that has to do with talking about Palestinian freedom and Israeli war crimes and genocide has been like mercilessly persecuted. This is very reminiscent to McCarthyism and anti-communism … because they have used every weapon available to them to try and crush this movement, including police violence,” she said
Activists say U of M building culture of fear against student movements
Beginning last year, the university said it would uphold its commitment to protect student free speech, but that it would not allow disruptive activity and that it was in the process of drafting a policy to address it. 
The university also reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to enhance its response to situations where free speech actions might “create a hostile environment for others.”
In June of this year, the university noted in a news release that its security strategy now includes using an outside firm to track student activists with plainclothes security personnel. That turned on the university quickly when it came to light that contractors allegedly drove a car at a student, impersonated a person with disabilities when confronted or accused students of robbing them.

https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/v12044gd0000d12tu2fog65p4ot611e0.mp4
“What happened was disturbing, unacceptable, and unethical, and we will not tolerate it,” Interim University President Domenico Grasso said in a statement from June. “Going forward, we are terminating all contracts with external vendors to provide plainclothes security on campus.”
Brown said the escalation of surveillance on student activists was creating a culture of fear to prevent students from exercising their First Amendment rights.
“They have leaned on state repression. Dana Nessel has used the FBI to break down people’s doors,” Brown said. “She’s charging students, who were just on the Diag and got beaten by police, charged with felonies. She tried to put us in a cage for protesting genocide.”
The Michigan Daily, the university’s student-led newspaper, reported that there are concerns the university plans to branch off its Office of Student Conflict Resolution into a subsidiary Office of Student Accountability, which Brown and others have likened to a private court system within the student disciplinary framework. Whereas the current office has a restorative justice aim, the new office would focus more on punitive measures.
In a statement, the TAHRIR Coalition, one of the organizations behind the student protests, said the new office would continue to retaliate against those who fight for university divestment from Israeli-linked companies and an end to the military occupation in Gaza and the West Bank.
“[University police gather] intelligence against students, identifying them through the Michigan State Police Biometrics Database, then sends the information to Student Investigator Donovan Golich, who relies exclusively on police evidence,” TAHRIR said in a news release.
Golich is the program manager for formal conflict resolution at the university. Activists have described his work as both investigatory in nature and with authority to bring disciplinary action against students. Brown said that includes facilitating the very disciplinary processes he initiates.
A university spokesperson did not respond to additional questions from the Advance on the creation of the new office, Golich’s role, and if his work served as a conflict of interest slanting the proceedings.
Brown called the new office a massive expansion of policing on campus. She also fears that the university’s and the state’s crackdowns could extend well beyond the current focus on Palestinian solidarity.
“I’m the former vice president of our labor union, the graduate employees organization, and we have a contract campaign coming up. And what does it mean for us?” Brown said. “We have pickets, we have protests. If those are now violating this statement of student rights and responsibilities, because they disrupt [operations], that means we can’t ever have pickets or protests. … They’re using these like very nit-picky rules that they’ve made, and they’re using the enforcement of that as a means of criminalization.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_6192-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-05 13:57:28.091339

Noem, in an interview with CBS News published Monday, said she hopes to establish a handful of similar detention centers near airports and jails in other states in the coming months, using Florida’s so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades as a model. She said she had already appealed to governors and state leaders. 
And CBS said potential sites already under consideration include Nebraska, Arizona and Louisiana.
Many states that support President Donald Trump’s mission of securing the border have empty or underused prison-like facilities, Noem noted. She said locations Homeland Security is considering are by airports and runways, which she said would help cut costs through “quick turnarounds.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operates under the umbrella of Homeland Security.
State-owned property that could fit her site preferences could include land near the Omaha Correctional Center by Eppley Airfield and the Nebraska National Guard base near the Lincoln airport.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen’s office shared a statement Tuesday, saying that his team “continues to be in communication with federal partners on how Nebraska can best assist in these efforts.”

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the governor is “staunchly committed to keeping Americans safe, our nation’s borders secure” and getting criminals “off our streets.”
She said it was premature to comment on potential detention operations, adding: “Gov. Pillen will make details public at the appropriate time.”
Noem’s strategy reportedly builds upon the “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center that opened last month at a jetport in the South Florida marshlands. It  was built in just days and has the capacity to house 3,000 migrants.
The effort would be assisted by the $45 billion set aside for ICE in President Donald Trump’s recently adopted “big beautiful bill.”

Nebraska State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a legislative watchdog on criminal justice issues, criticized the notion of Nebraska as a host site. 
“The idea of Nebraska operating a state-run detention facility is crazy and should not move forward,” he said. “Our focus should be on addressing the current budget deficit and reversing the decline of our state’s economy, both of which will only worsen with proposals like this.”
McKinney said that under the Trump administration, “enforcement efforts have expanded far beyond individuals labeled as criminals.”

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas education officials anticipate completing this fall a handful of outstanding rules related to a 2023 law that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system. 
The LEARNS Act contained several provisions in its 145 pages, including raising the minimum teacher salary to $50,000 and creating the Educational Freedom Account Program that allows state funds to be used for allowable education expenses like private school tuition. 
One provision that goes into effect this fall prohibits students who have not met the state’s third-grade reading standard from being promoted to fourth grade. The law allows for “a good-cause exemption.” 
Only 35% of students are reading at grade level, according to the Arkansas Department of Education.
The rules implementing this provision were added to the Right to Read Act Rules, which became effective July 1, 2024, according to ADE Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford. 
Though the rules have been promulgated, questions remain about what holding back third-graders looks like in practice. Salas-Ford told the Advocate ADE’s staff has been “drafting additional information and parameters to assist districts with implementation.” ADE’s intent was to add additional information to the Right to Read Act Rules, she said.

“Our legal team is reviewing the information now to determine if rule revision is necessary or if the information is solely guidance and thus, would not require promulgation,” Salas-Ford said.
Following the 2023 legislative session, more than 90 rules had to be written or revised due to new education laws, including 28 related to the LEARNS Act, according to ADE spokesperson Kimberly Mundell, who noted the rules process “is lengthy.”
“However, the LEARNS rules especially took longer than the usual because we formed work groups for each area and had ongoing stakeholder involvement throughout before we sent anything to the State Board for approval,” Mundell wrote in an email. 
Salas-Ford said there are a couple of sets of outstanding rules she anticipates being presented to the State Board of Education for approval this fall. Rules for the Course Choice Program, which allows students to enroll in courses not offered in their resident district, are being redrafted to incorporate changes from Act 730 of 2025. Public charter school rules are being redrafted to incorporate changes from Act 800 of 2025. 
Rules for Uniform Course Credit, which establish uniform postsecondary criteria for awarding credit to students, were redrafted to incorporate changes from Act 341 of 2025 and presented to the Higher Education Coordinating Board at its July 25 meeting. 
Act 341, the Arkansas ACCESS Act, builds on the LEARNS Act by making coordinated changes to the state’s K-12 and higher education systems. Provisions of the 123-page bill include expanding “accelerated learning” for high school students, prohibiting excused absences for political protests and incorporating a return-on-investment metric into the higher education funding model.
Another set of LEARNS Act rules related to the prohibition of “indoctrination” in schools was “placed on hold pending the outcome of relevant litigation,” Mundell said. 
A federal appeals panel ruled last month that Arkansas ban on “indoctrination” doesn’t violate public-school students’ free speech protections because the government has a right to dictate what is taught. 
In light of the ruling, Salas-Ford confirmed Monday that ADE “will be proceeding with the rules as required but have not finished drafting them at this time.” Once the draft is complete, it will be presented to the state education board for approval, she said. 
During its meeting last Friday, state board chair Adrienne Woods said a special virtual meeting may be scheduled before the board’s regular September meeting to approve some rules. A date or agenda for the meeting was not available as of Tuesday.

U.S. families lose nearly $350 billion each year due to the incarceration of a loved one in jail or prison, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.

The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.

The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.
Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday named Asztalos director of the Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD), making him Florida’s  top advocate for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. He begins on Aug. 18.
“Bob has dedicated his career to serving others, including his leadership at the Florida Department of Veterans’ Affairs,” DeSantis said in a prepared release. “I’m confident he will work hard to improve the lives of Floridians with unique abilities.”
Asztalos joins APD from the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs, where he served as deputy executive director and helped lead the agency to a successful 2025 session. 
“The governor gave me the privilege, for four years, to carry out his vision to provide outstanding care to the senior veterans who reside in our state veteran nursing homes,” Asztalos said in a statement to the Florida Phoenix. “It was a true honor to ensure that the waning years of their lives were meaningful. Now he has entrusted me to do the same for Floridians with unique abilities. I am blessed to make a difference in the lives of frail or vulnerable Floridians.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
His move to APD comes as the Legislature this year agreed to invest tens of millions of dollars to expand statewide a pilot project for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The program now operates only in Medicaid regions D and I, which serve Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties and is limited to 600 people on the waiting list for another Medicaid program called iBudget. iBudget provides clients with money to choose services to help with activities of daily living such as eating and bathing. Those home- and community-based services allow clients to live in their communities and outside of institutions. 
HB 1103 lifts the 600-person cap on the pilot program on Oct. 1, expanding enrollment statewide for people on the iBudget wait list. Enrollment opens to every Medicaid-eligible person with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including those already enrolled in iBudget and the managed-care program known as the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care long-term care program.
 Job duties

As APD executive director, Asztalos will be tasked with ensuring that statewide implementation runs smoothly.
But that’s not all.
HB 1103 also made substantive changes to how APD operates, requiring the agency to be more transparent about the billion-dollar iBudget program, mandating that it  post quarterly reports on its website regarding operations, including the numbers of clients served and  people on the wait list. APD routinely posted the information on its website for years but in the last two years under the DeSantis administration has stopped making the information — which the agency is required to submit to the Legislature — publicly available. 
Another administrative change in HB 1103 is the creation of  a statewide family council charged with working with APD on policy. The council will  work alongside the existing local family care councils. These councils have for the last 31 years worked with families of people with disabilities, sharing information about programs, services, and resources available in Florida.

Before working for the state, Asztalos was chief lobbyist for the state’s largest nursing home association, the Florida Health Care Association.  He also lobbied for Easter Seals Florida. A Navy and Navy Reserve veteran with 29 years of service, Asztalos also served 17 years in the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.
Asztalos replaces Lorena Fulcher, who has been interim executive director since Taylor Hatch left the post in February to  head the Department of Children and Families. The DCF position was open after DeSantis shifted Shevaun Harris from DCF secretary to head the Agency for Health Care Administration. 
Following the Hope Florida investigation by the Florida House of Representatives, the Florida Senate didn’t confirm either Hatch or Harris. Following the end of the session, DeSantis reappointed Hatch and Harris to their positions. They must be confirmed by the Florida Senate next year or will be required to vacate their posts.

Historically redlined communities have less access to rapid emergency medical services, according to the findings of a new study. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.
The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.

Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.
“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
 Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 will end those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
‘The power is on in SC’ legislators proclaim in celebrating massive energy law

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly, there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
 A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
Hiring begins for the employees who will maintain Scout Motors’ SC assembly lines

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

In Albuquerque, the Pew Charitable Trusts’ proposal represents a possible key to the puzzle of converting vacant office spaces into housing. By turning the centers of office complex floorplans into shared bathrooms or kitchen spaces, all renters will live in apartments with natural light, and developers can keep costs low by reducing the number of individual kitchens and plumbing features. 
Albuquerque had a 24% downtown office vacancy rate in the first quarter of 2025, according to the report, which translates to approximately 535,000 square feet of downtown vacant office space.

Across the city in the first quarter of 2025, nearly 2 million square feet of office space lies empty, representing a city-wide vacancy rate of 14%, according to a market report from Colliers investment management. According to the report, that’s a decrease, but only slightly, from the 16% vacancy rate in the first quarter of 2021, when many offices across the city and nationwide were emptied due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
While office buildings in Albuquerque sit empty, homelessness has greatly increased across the city, growing by 108% since 2017, a rate more than two times the national average. Median rents here also increased 46% between 2019 and 2024. Santa Fe has seen similar growth. 
Alex Horowitz, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ housing policy initiative, told Source New Mexico on Monday that “flexible co-living,” which he also called “dorm-style housing,” would make the most sense in both Albuquerque and Santa Fe for low-income, rent-burdened households, mostly of one or two people. 
“This is not housing for people coming off the street, necessarily, but it would slow inflows into homelessness sharply by offering housing at a lower price point,” he said. 
In consultation with the Gensler architecture firm, researchers mocked up floor plans based on actual Albuquerque buildings, Horowitz said, and arrived at estimated rents of $700 and approximate public subsidies of about $230,000. 
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

In such a building, “instead of having 60 bathrooms, you might have 18 or something, and that’s plenty, but that gets costs down sharply. Same with the kitchens,” he said. “And by being located near commerce, right near stores, near transit, that puts people in a good spot to be able to get around, get to a job, school, services — whatever they need.”
And Horowitz said the same concept is true for Santa Fe, even though it doesn’t have the same central business district or inventory of large office buildings. Pew recommends developers build “neighborhood-scale” co-living apartment complexes, a model researchers said “may also be suitable for similar communities across the state.”
“In Albuquerque and Santa Fe this would be a way to add a lot of low cost housing that would be much less expensive to build than regular apartments and certainly less than houses, and would enable lower rents in two cities that badly need housing at a lower price point,” he said. 
Current median rents in Santa Fe are nearly $1,500, according to the report. Pew estimates rents would be $800 at one of the complexes it hopes developers would build. 
Horowitz estimated current per-unit building costs for developers are about $300,000. By converting Albuquerque office space into apartments, that price plummets to $130,000 a unit, he said. In Santa Fe, even with the cost of building a new complex, the savings the co-living model produces brings the price down to $184,000 a unit, according to the report. 
In addition to the report, Horowitz and a co-author wrote an article about their proposal here, and Horowitz will testify next week in Los Lunas to the interim legislative committee tasked with rural development and policy.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-05-at-10.28.50-AM-1024x566.png,,,2025-08-05 12:57:03.700491

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee is at the forefront of making homelessness invisible, and I fear that the Trump administration’s recent executive order on street homelessness will bolster the state’s approach to moving unhoused Tennesseans out of sight whenever possible.
Homelessness is the consequence and visible failure of housing and healthcare policies that have pushed more and more households to the brink of existence in every county – including urban, suburban and rural areas. 
While Tennessee’s total homelessness numbers have not stood out at the national level so far, it nonetheless has become a testing ground for conservative think tanks like the Cicero Institute that lobbied state politicians to lock people away rather than house them.
Consequently, Tennessee became the first state in 2022 to make camping on public property a felony. But Tennessee’s legislature has not stopped there. The most recent laws targeting unhoused Tennesseans passed this year. 
Most notably, one law requires the Department of Transportation to develop agreements with counties for the removal of camps along highways, under bridges and overpasses. The legislature removed a $64-million fiscal note and shifted the cost for the cleanups as well as finding housing and services to local jurisdictions.
Bill would let local governments set up homeless camps, order mental health treatment

The Trump administration’s executive order is called “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” It outlines a move in addressing homelessness away from housing-oriented solutions to forced civil confinements, predicated on the argument that confinement will give people the recovery services they need. 
The problem is that without housing, we won’t end homelessness. And without funding for both housing and support services, authorities in rural Tennessee will be left with the only option of sending their unhoused constituents to the larger cities in the hope they find services there. With city shelters already full to the brink, we’ll see an increase in street homelessness. Even hyped up encampment closures, like those in Nashville, won’t be able to stem that tide.
Studies show that putting people into institutional settings and forcing them into treatments is not effective. Simply put, if locking people up to end homelessness would work, Tennessee would already have solved street homelessness. We certainly have all the laws on the book for it.
Another aspect of the complex issue is cost. While the new executive order aims to shift funding from housing programs to temporary programs including mental health facilities, a quick cost comparison seems to support my belief that we will serve fewer people with these forced confinements and treatments.
I recently looked at the per diem cost of jail versus an inpatient psychiatric bed and compared it to a permanent supportive housing program for people with severe and persistent mental illness and/or substance use disorders.

A jail stay in Davidson County costs about $115 per night.
An in-patient psychiatric bed at East Tennessee Behavioral Health has a per diem cost ranging from $675 to $2,500.
A supportive housing bed with intensive case management for people with mental illness and/or substance use issues, run by nonprofits specialized in housing people experiencing homelessness in Tennessee, costs about $80 per day.

On the surface, all of these policies, laws and executive orders may sound reasonable to anyone who is comfortably housed and actually cares about their unhoused neighbors. But to advocates like me, these policies are putting bigger targets on people who already have fallen through our safety nets. 
Knoxville, Memphis, and Chattanooga actually showed a double-digit reduction in homelessness between 2022 and 2024 through their housing-focused approach. Nashville’s encampment closure strategy did not show the same results.
Bill to hold charities liable for providing housing to certain immigrants heads to governor’s desk

But rural counties are left to fend for themselves as homelessness becomes more visible. Grundy County officials struggle with homeless encampments hidden in the woods. Since COVID, Maury County has seen a tremendous increase in street homelessness. And this past January, volunteers in Cheatham County conducted the first outdoor homelessness count, which was eye-opening for government and faith leaders who believed there was no street homelessness in their county. 
Rural homelessness used to be less visible as people stayed in cars, campers and dilapidated housing without electricity or plumbing. In recent years, however, outdoor homelessness has increased and become more visible. 
The people seen in our rural counties are from the community they still live in and are connected to the people who work there, which makes it hard for local authorities tasked to arrest them and force them into criminal or civil confinements. 
So what can local governments do? 
In my opinion, local leaders should take a regional approach to homelessness and ask state legislators to stop what essentially boils down to Band-id approaches by criminalizing homelessness and forced treatment.
Instead, a regional approach that is led by rural county and rural city officials could convince the legislature to invest in funding for:

Street outreach teams that consist of health and mental health professionals as well as social workers to assist people where they are while helping them access housing and then continue to offer recovery services once they are in housing; and
The creation of a state-funded rental assistance demonstration program that is co-designed by cities and counties to help prevent and end homelessness in rural areas.

State departments, specifically the Tennessee Housing Development Agency and the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, already have experience in similar federally funded programs and easily could help rural communities develop these approaches.
Tennessee could become a national model for making homelessness invisible permanently – by investing in people rather than in facilities that will only offer a stopgap measure to move the poorest Tennesseans out of sight in the short-term.

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.










It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, professor of sports marketing at Clemson University


After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
A Valley Children’s spokesperson told Stateline that game-day entitlements at the stadium, such as the tailgates, catering and suite, have been used for patients and their families.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

President Donald Trump signed an order on April 8, 2025, aimed at boosting coal production. (Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)A few years back, my friend Norm told me that when he was growing up in northern New Mexico in the 1950s and early ‘60s, his family often drove up to the La Plata Mountains in southwestern Colorado. From there he could see all the way to the Sandia Mountains outside Albuquerque, some 200 miles away. 
His statement saddened me, since in all the time I spent on Four Corners high points, a persistent haze always limited my visibility to maybe 50 or 60 miles, blurring Shiprock’s sharp spires into a fuzzy silhouette. That’s because a fleet of massive coal-fired power plants in the region churned out haze-producing pollutants, harming humans and the ecology and blotting out vistas from the San Juans to the Sandias. It seemed as if I’d never get a view as clear as Norm’s. 
But over the last decade, the failing economics of coal shuttered those power plants. That means the air on the Colorado Plateau—when not sullied by the ever-lengthening wildfire season—has become cleaner as the coal industry faded away.
The shuttered plants include Mojave, Navajo, Nucla, Escalante, San Juan and, most recently, Cholla. The closures certainly sharpened the view of folks all over the region. But more importantly, they kept tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and oodles of harmful pollutants (arsenic, mercury, sulfur dioxide and soot) out of the lungs of nearby residents, many of them on the Navajo Nation. 
Yet in defiance of the free market that has boosted renewables, the Trump administration is acting to undo those positive changes and make the air dirty again by throwing multiple lifelines to the flagging coal industry.
It has eviscerated environmental protections limiting mercury and other toxic air emissions, ended Obama-and Biden-era freezes on new federal coal leases, and rescinded limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The administration has also blocked utilities from shutting down plants that are old, dirty and more costly than other power sources. 
Trump purports to do this in the name of “unleashing” coal from regulatory constraints so it can be mined and burned to achieve American “energy dominance.” Yet it’s unlikely that unleashing the industry will reverse its decline.
It’s true that delaying implementation of the mercury rule will enable the Colstrip coal plant in Montana—one of the nation’s dirtiest facilities—to continue operating without expensive new pollution control equipment. Generally, though, utilities such as Xcel Energy, Intermountain Power Agency and Tri-State Generation & Transmission are moving forward with plans to retire their coal plants, namely because the aging facilities are dirty, inefficient, inflexible and, most of all, no longer profitable. They just can’t compete with natural gas, solar, wind, and other, cleaner energy sources.
When signing one of his fossil-fuel-friendly orders, Trump said he would “save” the Cholla coal plant near Holbrook, Arizona, from destruction, adding, “We’re going to have that plant opening and burning the clean coal, beautiful clean coal, in a very short period of time.” 
But its operator, Arizona Public Service, said it had already procured cleaner, cheaper generation for the plant, and had no desire to keep burning coal at Cholla. There was no save needed.
If Trump were truly interested in energy dominance and abundance, he would have supported the fastest-growing energy sources—wind and solar power. Instead, his administration is doing all it can to stifle them, from eliminating production tax credits for renewable energy in his “big, beautiful” budget bill, to slowing down permits for clean energy developments on public lands. Both utility-scale and rooftop solar will be affected, boosting the prospects of oil and gas, coal and nuclear. 
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, in an Economist column, revealed the philosophy behind the administration’s fossil-fuel fetishization. He wrote that climate change is “not an existential crisis,” merely a “byproduct of progress.” He said he was willing to take the “modest negative trade-off” of climate change—along, presumably, with ever more devastating heat waves, wildfires and floods—”for this legacy of human advancement.” 
He is probably correct in saying that climate change and the sullied air over the Colorado Plateau are byproducts of so-called progress. But they are also nasty, deadly and avoidable. Ultimately, going backward toward coal will not only wreck progress, but perhaps life on Earth as we know it.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/073124_coal-train_05-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-08-05 12:57:03.700491

(Photo courtesy of New Energy Equities)Xcel Energy can retroactively reduce payments to most of the roughly 30,000 Minnesotans who subscribe to community solar gardens, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on Monday in a significant victory for the utility company.
The decision ratifies an earlier Minnesota Public Utilities Commission order that cut compensation for customers who subscribed to “legacy” gardens built in the last decade. Those facilities still account for most of Minnesota’s community solar capacity and more than half its total solar energy capacity.
Community solar subscribers pay solar garden operators for the energy produced by their shares and receive corresponding bill credits from their electric utilities. Xcel Energy argued the wildly successful program unfairly shifted costs onto non-subscribers, but consumer advocates along with Minnesota cities, school districts and universities warned reducing the credit rate would broadly increase costs to the public.
In public comments last January, the cities of St. Paul, St. Cloud and Burnsville said the change from bill credits based on the retail rate of electricity to a lower “value of solar” formula would cost them each millions over the remaining years of their 25-year contracts. Minneapolis said 65 of its 80 community solar subscriptions would flip from saving to costing the city money, risking a property tax rise. The University of Minnesota warned its projected $1.2 million annual loss “could increase costs for students and taxpayers,” according to a PUC staff report.
“This hurts everyone in the tax base, not just the subscribers,” said Pouya Najmaie, policy and regulatory director for community solar developer Cooperative Energy Futures, which opposed the compensation change.
Changing how bill credits are calculated could reduce credit values by around 30% for some subscribers, Najmaie said.
Though it said in its initial proposal that the new bill credit calculation would serve the public interest by saving non-subscribing ratepayers an estimated $48.4 million each year, Xcel Energy also warned of a “potential shock to subscribers and public budgets” in subsequent comments filed with the Public Utilities Commission.
As of 2023, nonresidential entities represented 10% of unique community solar subscribers but received 82% of all bill credits, according to Minnesota House nonpartisan research staff. One public commenter last year said public entities that subscribe to community solar gardens serve some 2.75 million Minnesota residents, including families whose children attend public schools.
“This decision will significantly and negatively affect the many Minnesota school districts that are community solar subscribers,” Minnesota School Boards Association executive director Kirk Schneidawind said in a statement Monday warning of “potential property tax increases and reduced school programming that might result from the change.”
Xcel filed the compensation change proposal in 2023 at the commission’s request. It did not take a formal position on the issue before the commission approved the rate change in a May 30 order last year. That order modified Xcel’s proposal to include a gradual transition from retail to value of solar credits and delayed implementation until April 1, 2025.
The commission denied a subsequent request by community solar subscribers, developers and industry groups to reconsider its decision. In an order last August, the commission characterized the effect of the change as a reduction in savings, rather than an increase in costs and said the delayed implementation date would give subscribers and developers time to address any financial impacts.
Meanwhile, it added, “the harm to non-subscribing ratepayers identified in the May 30 Order will continue so long as (community solar gardens) remain on the (retail) rate.”
The Court of Appeals broadly agreed in a Monday decision rebuffing three solar developers’ claims that the commission lacked the statutory authority to retroactively change compensation for legacy solar gardens. The 2013 law authorizing community solar gardens describes the retail-rate calculation as a temporary bridge to a permanent value of solar framework, Judge Jon Schmidt wrote, and the commission has discretion to modify rates “consistent with the public interest” so long as it “reasonably allow[s] for the creation, financing, and accessibility of community solar gardens.”
Xcel Energy hailed the ruling as a win for ratepayers and its efforts to source all of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.
“As we continue to integrate more renewable energy into the grid, we are focused on keeping energy service affordable for our customers. Today’s Court of Appeals ruling supports that objective by upholding the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s unanimous decision from May 2024 (that) lowered the cost of the community solar garden program for all customers,” spokesperson Theo Keith said in an email.
The decision will save Xcel customers an estimated $28 million this year and $39 million in future years, Keith said.
But it’s far from clear that the value of solar rate truly allows for “reasonable” community solar development, Najmaie said. CEF and many other community solar developers all but halted development work in 2017, when the lower value of solar rate took effect for new projects, he said.
That hiatus continued until 2024, when a state law easing restrictions on community solar development and expanding access for public entities and lower-income subscribers took effect. CEF now has five solar gardens in development, Najmaie said, despite federal policy changes expected to increase the cost to build them.
The 2024 law also makes it more difficult for the Public Utilities Commission to retroactively change bill credit compensation, Najmaie said. But that’s no help for legacy subscribers left in the lurch by Monday’s court decision, which Najmaie said could erode public trust in the community solar program, make it harder for projects to sign up new subscribers and potentially scare off the lenders community solar developers rely on.
“Financiers are looking at Minnesota and saying, well, if they can change rates now, why can’t they change them later,” he said. “Is it worth coming to Minnesota at all when we now have 20 other community solar states where we don’t have to deal with this stuff?”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Long-Lake-CSG-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-08-05 11:59:02.965606

Historically redlined communities have less access to rapid emergency medical services, according to the findings of a new study. (Brandon Bell | Getty Images)Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.
The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.
Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court’s request to the parties in a Louisiana redistricting case could affect Alabama’s similar, long-running battle over congressional boundaries.
In an order issued Friday, the justices asked parties to address whether the state’s creation of a second majority-Black congressional district violated the Fourteenth or Fifteenth amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which provide for congressional representation and due process and forbid the denial of the vote based on race.
Experts say the move could signal that the U.S. Supreme Court is looking to overturn Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which forbids election laws that discriminate based on race, color, or membership in language minority groups.
A lower federal court in 2023 ordered Alabama to draw a second “opportunity” district for Black voters after ruling that Alabama’s racially polarized voting patterns — where white voters tend to support Republicans and Black voters tend to support Democrats — meant a map approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2021 did not give Black voters a chance to choose their preferred leaders.
The court’s ruling in the case, known as Allen v. Milligan, leaned in large part on Section 2 of the law, and Jason Mazzone, a professor of law at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, wrote in an email that the Supreme Court’s order for supplemental briefing was “a very big deal.”
“The case might result in the Court invalidating entirely Section 2 of the VRA on the basis that the Constitution is color blind and it bars race-conscious districting, including when mandated by Congress to remedy historical racial discrimination in voting,” Mazzone wrote. “Such a result would represent a massive change in election laws and practices with seismic consequences for democratic processes at every level of government.”
The Louisiana case, Louisiana v. Callais, stems from a map drawn by the state legislature that created a second majority-minority district to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The map was subsequently challenged as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander by a group of non-Black voters.
Black representation
The Milligan plaintiffs sued Alabama shortly after the Legislature approved a new congressional map in 2021. A three-judge panel ruled for the plaintiffs in early 2022, but the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the lower court’s original ruling. The court upheld it in 2023, which led to a special session of the Alabama Legislature that July. Legislators approved a map that House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter signaled was an attempt to get the case back before the U.S. Supreme Court. The lower court rejected the map and the nation’s high court upheld that ruling on appeal. The court later had a special master draw a new congressional map for the state.
Under the map, Alabama in 2024 elected two Black U.S. representatives to serve together for the first time in state history.
Following a trial earlier this year, the panel in May ruled that the Alabama Legislature intentionally discriminated against Black voters in approving the map in the July 2023 special session. The court is considering sanctions for the state, which could include requiring any future maps to win approval from the court, a process known as preclearance.
Deuel Ross, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund who represents plaintiffs in Alabama’s redistricting case, offered a more cautious view in an interview on Monday. Ross noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had a chance to invalidate Section 2 of the VRA in the Milligan case two years ago, but chose not to.
“Just two years ago, a majority of the Supreme Court in Milligan expressly agreed that the Voting Rights Act is constitutional,” Ross said.
Ross said the Supreme Court’s request for briefs “doesn’t necessarily mean that the justices are looking to strike down the Voting Rights Act.”
“They’re asking about a particular district in this specific Louisiana map,” Ross said.

Back when I was a kid in 1988, my mama and I had an argument about what I wanted to major in at college.
I had dreamed of being a journalist since the age of 8. To me, that meant that I was going to Ole Miss, which had the journalism department.
My mama said I could only go away from home to Ole Miss if I was going to major in law.
So I settled on going to Mississippi State University just down the road and majoring in communication. She told me I should major in engineering since that’s what State was known for.
I said, “That’s even dumber than me going to law school. I hate math.”
“Well, you could at least try,” she said.
I said no. Then she told me I was wasting my education and turned her back on me.

I get it. She knew and I knew that I couldn’t stay in Choctaw County where I was raised and earn a living with that degree. I would have to go somewhere else — probably to the Jackson metro area and work for Gannett or the Associated Press. Or to Memphis. Or Biloxi. Or even New Orleans. She never really forgave me for moving to the Jackson metro, working in my field and raising her grandchildren so far from her.
After a while, I got used to the pace of life around here. I knew I probably wouldn’t ever move anywhere else because I noticed that people who left Mississippi often came back, whether due to family obligations or a realization that “somewhere else” wasn’t quite all it was cracked up to be.
I also noticed that a lot of people played up how they were from Mississippi while making a very good living being someplace else. I decided I wanted to prove you could be from Mississippi, live in Mississippi, work in Mississippi and make something of yourself without leaving Mississippi. 
But I noticed something else over the years, too. Most of the kids in Brandon dreamed of going off from home to cities like Atlanta, Nashville, Dallas, DC, New York or Orlando. They didn’t seem to have reasons — just a desire to get away from the state as fast as they could. 
Then my three daughters and I started having conversations about what they wanted to major in when they went to college. My oldest wanted to be a chef. My middle one was undecided between chemical engineering and landscape architecture. And my youngest was fascinated with roads and bridges.
I was all too aware of what had happened in the job markets in Mississippi since I had come up. Companies closed operations in a globalized economy and fled to cheaper labor markets. The advent of the internet meant employers could hire from all over the world. Longtime business leaders retired and sold out to big corporations that reduced investments in local communities that had supported those businesses for decades and then complained that those towns didn’t offer enough amenities for their employees to want to relocate there. 
But the reality really set in when my chef daughter chose her first internship — in historic Williamsburg, Virginia. 
I would never have dreamed of driving that far from home to try out a place to work when I was her age. Then after her senior year, she interned at Walt Disney World and got hired full-time before the internship was over. She was off to live in Orlando where now with her husband and young son she’s creating community and loves going to work every day with a pretty enviable benefits package, too, a thing unheard of in the culinary world in Mississippi.
My middle one finally settled on chemical engineering and was picked for a co-op job in her first semester at age 18 at a company in Georgia. When she graduated four years later, we packed her off to Indiana for a research and development job, and she now lives in New Hampshire with her husband, making six figures a year at 26 years old and looking forward to partaking in the cultural offerings in New York City when she can.
The youngest is currently in college for civil engineering, and I’m bracing myself for the inevitable. She doesn’t want to work for state government, so she’s likely going out of state as well. Her comment about coming back to Jackson metro was the most damning of all. “There’s nothing to do here,” she says.
A lot of people ask me questions: How often do you see your daughters? How can you stand being so far from your grandson? Don’t they at least come home for Christmas?
The answer to all of those questions is that we do the best we can. We text, we message on Facebook, we talk on the phone at least once a week, every Sunday. We arrange visits; sometimes it’s us driving to them while other times they drive to us. 
I can’t imagine making my children as miserable as my mom made me over my life choices. We are flexible, understanding, and very, very proud of  our daughters, who are grappling with enough in their lives without us loading them down with guilt over when they are coming  home. 
The calculus may change in the future. We may have declines in health and need to move closer to one of our children if we need assistance. Or we may need to be in assisted living care here in Mississippi where such care may be marginally cheaper than wherever our girls land.
But I don’t wish our girls had settled for life in Mississippi. 
What I wish is that Mississippi could find a way to live up to its potential — to be a place more worthy of my daughters’ loyalty, affections and investment in themselves. 
Maybe it will be someday. I hope so, for all of our sakes.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)This week, Utah joined a growing list of states getting requests for confidential voter roll data from the federal Department of Justice. If these states say “no,” the law, federalism, and election security are on their side. That is exactly what they should do.
Back in March, the Trump administration issued an executive order on election integrity. This order sought to standardize some state election laws and security standards, citing federal laws such as the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act. Among other things, it criticized states for embracing various methods of voting and ballot counting.
Fast forward to today. In recent weeks, states from Maine to California (including my home state of Utah) have gotten letters from the federal Department of Justice requesting private voter information. It has been reported that the DOJ told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it intends to send these letters to all 50 states. These letters cite the Help America Vote Act and suggest that the DOJ is seeking to ensure compliance with this federal law.
The requested information includes descriptions of various state election processes and procedures, as well as a state’s “current statewide voter registration list.” The latter presents a serious problem that jeopardizes legal compliance and election integrity.
Some of the information on voter rolls is public information that is required to be public under federal law. On the other hand, some voter roll information is sensitive, private identifying information.
Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

When it comes to disclosing confidential voter roll information, election officials in Utah and elsewhere should follow the wisdom taught to school children in dealing with people pushing harmful things on them: “Just say no.”
Sound legal analysis puts the law on the side of doing so. The federal Privacy Act of 1974 requires federal departments like the DOJ to provide public notice of any effort to collect data – even publicly available data – to allow public discussion and comment on the desired federal data gathering before it takes place. That hasn’t happened. Additionally, states that share voter roll information with the DOJ without entering into data-sharing agreements required by law may be subject to legal liability.
Just as problematic is how the DOJ request for voter roll information undermines election security by making it easier to commit election fraud.
The foundation of the integrity of American elections lies in our tendency to avoid centralizing authority and information regarding elections – prioritizing federalism over politics. Federal entities create voter equipment standards, states typically maintain voter rolls, local election officials handle and count ballots, and voters themselves ensure their ballot remains secure until it is cast.
In other words, widespread voter fraud in the United States under the current system requires the co-opting of all levels of government or society simultaneously. This is why there is so little concrete evidence of actual voter fraud in America, even with so many elections happening every year. There are anecdotal stories that raise the specter of possible fraud, such as when someone’s friend or relative is sent a ballot that they shouldn’t have gotten, but these stories primarily illustrate how the people themselves are preventing possible fraud.
It is federalism – the disbursed responsibilities and safeguards at every level of government across the nation — not top-down federal attempts like this latest DOJ compliance effort, that ensure election integrity.
How much easier would election fraud become if the DOJ collected all voter data in a central database? Potential fraudsters would breathe a sigh of relief if they only had to hack one federal voter database instead of 50 state voter databases.
Whether based on the law or election security principles, and regardless of which party controls the federal executive branch, states should say “no” to the federal DOJ request for private voter information. They will be protecting election integrity if they do.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.










We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce


“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
A slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

Gomez de la Torre oversees the migrant education program for 12 central Florida counties. The federally funded service helps the children of migrant agricultural workers, who move within and between states based on planting and harvesting seasons.
Her staff identifies agricultural workers who’ve migrated to the area and helps them enroll their children in school. It also helps connect them with tutoring and medical care.
Earlier this summer, the Trump administration froze more than $6 billion in education funding, including money for migrant education, after-school programs, English-language programs for non-native speakers and other grants. Congress had already approved the money, but the administration said it wanted to conduct a review of the programs.
The administration announced last Friday it would release the remaining $5.5 billion of the money, after unfreezing $1.3 billion earlier this month.
But for Gomez de la Torre’s program, the damage had already been done: Without the money, it had to shut down this summer.
“We didn’t have enough money left over to carry the program,” said Joram Rejouis, the director of program development for the public schools in Alachua County, which includes Gainesville and is the largest of the 12 counties. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage.”
The program came to a complete halt when Gomez de la Torre’s 11 staff members were offered other positions in the school district. Throughout July, about five dozen migrant children across the 12 counties were without summer services. The funds were supposed to go out before the start of the month.
“It’s going horrendously,” said Gomez de la Torre. “Migrant families depend on us, rely on our system and our help.”
The Alachua County program serves about 1,000 to 1,200 children of migrant workers throughout the year, many in rural farming communities. Each year, roughly 17,000 migrant children are served by programs across Florida.
“It is a very valuable program for a very vulnerable population,” Rejouis said. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.”
Migrant children are less likely to have regular primary care and are more likely to face health conditions such as anemia and high blood pressure. Many migrant families who harvest food in the fields don’t have enough food themselves.
The program also helps with communication and translation among parents, teachers and guidance counselors. “We were their go-to for whenever they needed something,” Gomez de la Torre said. “Now, they don’t have us.”
The freeze in funds added to the uncertainty and fear created by the Trump administration’s broader moves to target benefits for immigrants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently announced it had added Head Start to the list of public programs that would be closed to immigrants who are here illegally. After the funding announcement earlier this month, a senior official said the administration had established “guardrails” to ensure the funds are not used “in violation of Executive Orders.”
“It’s anybody’s guess when we’ll come back,” Gomez de la Torre said. “If we’ll come back. If people who chose to retire will return, if their retirement can be rescinded. … Nobody knows exactly how it’s going to play out.”
A similar story is unfolding in California.
The statewide Mini Corps program, run by the Butte County Office of Education, north of Sacramento, connects migrant children at schools and labor camps with bilingual tutors who help them during the school day. Many of the tutors are former migrant children themselves, said Yvette Medina, who oversees the program.
The funding freeze forced the office to lay off around 400 workers statewide, according to spokesperson Travis Souders. Despite Friday’s announcement, the organization is waiting for official word — in writing — before reversing layoffs.
“There’s going to be many students out there who are just going to have another disadvantage to the disadvantages that we already have,” Medina said.
In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, the program was forced to shut down altogether, according to Medina.
Medina grew up in migrant labor camps, following her parents to the fields at 4 a.m. as they picked cherries and grapes before she went to school. Her parents worked throughout the Central Valley, back in Mexico and up and down the West Coast, all the way to Oregon.
“It is devastating,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the migrant program, I know for a fact there’s no way I would have graduated high school.”
Migrant families already are gripped with fear as the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids and arrests, which President Donald Trump insists are focused on those with criminal histories.
“They are terrified,” Gomez de la Torre said. “We had families stop sending kids to school and others who fled the country.”
Ruby Luis, a consultant who helps school districts across Florida identify and enroll migrant students in school, also was a migrant child. Her parents worked in orange groves, at strawberry and Christmas tree farms and produce-packing houses.
Program tutors read books with her and gave her school supplies. The program took her on college tours and she enrolled via a scholarship for migrant children — a first-generation college student. She eventually graduated with a degree in biology.
“Just having even somebody to talk to you about going to college — because you don’t have anybody to talk to about [that],” she said. “Having that support was really impactful.
“To take that away, and then now they just have to navigate it themselves, it creates these barriers,” Luis said. “And it can ultimately leave these children not having access to education.”

Pat Pettey, a Kansas City Democrat shown speaking on the Senate floor in April, received results of a legislative audit of the state's inspector general's work to uncover fraud in state payments for health care services. In four years, the inspector general's work resulted in prosecution of two people and court judgments of about $7,500. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas inspector general assigned to the attorney general’s office prosecuted two cases of alleged health program fraud, resulting in judgments against perpetrators of $7,500 over the past four years.
A report by the Kansas Legislature’s auditing division said the inspector general from 2021 to 2024 fielded more than 5,500 complaints and opened 280 investigations. Almost three of every five cases remained open, auditors said. One-fourth were closed without action after allegations were disproven, there was insufficient evidence to proceed or the money lost was too inconsequential to justify further work.
“Most of the complaints come from the Department for Children and Families and allege benefit eligibility fraud,” said senior auditor Matt Fahrenbruch.
The audit requested by Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, was completed in July. The Legislature’s audit of the inspector general’s office focused on financial recovery and prosecutorial results. Auditors examined the 280 investigations, consulted court records and interviewed the inspector general’s staff. The inspector general’s personnel grew from four people in 2021 to 10 employees in 2024.
The report indicated the inspector general referred seven cases to law enforcement for prosecution during the four-year period. Fahrenbruch said two of the seven cases resulted in judgments against defendants.
In one case, an individual misrepresented household income to gain Medicaid benefits worth at least $25,000. The person was charged with multiple felonies and agreed to pay $2,500 in restitution in 2023. Auditors said the person stopped payments in 2024 after reimbursing the state $920. The other case involved a woman who forged information to claim a pregnancy to gain Medicaid services. As part of a plea agreement, she was ordered to pay $5,000 in restitution.
“Since ’21 we’ve gone from four (staff) to now in ’24 10 additional staff with this kind of recoup of funds?” Pettey said.
In one of the five cases categorized as awaiting prosecution, auditors said a person with power of attorney diverted a $186,500 inheritance from a relative who was an institutionalized Medicaid beneficiary. Local law enforcement conducted a preliminary investigation and recovered most of the money from the suspect. The inspector general took over the case and returned the funds to the victim.
Inspector General Steven Anderson, who now works under Attorney General Kris Kobach, said the public should recognize the Legislature didn’t appropriate funding to hire two full-time special agents until 2023.
“You can’t do investigations if you don’t have investigators. It’s that simple,” Anderson said.
He also said the Legislature should view cases in which an allegation was disproven as a successful conclusion to an inquiry by the inspector general.
“For anybody who’s been wrongly accused to be exonerated is a real plus,” Anderson said. “So, those don’t add dollars. They don’t show up as recoveries. They don’t show up as savings, but for the people subject to those investigations, it’s a win.”
The latest audit did make reference to a 2021 report revealing the Kansas Department of Health and Environment mistakenly overpaid companies delivering Medicaid services to disabled, elderly and low-income Kansans from 2015 to 2020. It was discovered managed care organizations hired by the state were paid $1.3 million for care associated with 25 individuals who were deceased.
KDHE recovered $1.1 million from three managed-care companies by withholding subsequent state Medicaid payments. A fourth company no longer employed by Kansas repaid $171,000.
Anderson said the Legislature’s audit noted but didn’t attempt to confirm the inspector general’s estimate that oversight from his office led to $3.2 million in “future savings,” based on identifying and removing people who benefitted from the health assistance programs but were ineligible.
“We didn’t evaluate the validity of the numbers as part of this limited-scope audit,” said Fahrenbruch, the senior auditor with the Legislature.
The audit said “the concept of waste didn’t meet the definition of recoupment for the state” so questions about the accuracy of the inspector general’s estimates weren’t evaluated.
In addition, Anderson said the audit mentioned but didn’t confirm the purported $8 million in savings that could have occurred if the state’s billing for emergency alert services and equipment had been handled as recommended by the inspector general.
Auditors also didn’t explore the inspector general’s estimate that $320 million in “wasted funds” had been identified by his office from 2021 to 2024, Anderson said.
For example, in 2022 the inspector general concluded the state’s Home and Community Based Services program paid $193 million for 2,850 beneficiaries who hadn’t used those services in more than a year, despite rules requiring monthly use to remain eligible. In its response, the Department for Aging and Disability Services agreed to take steps to improve oversight of that funding.
The Kansas inspector general’s office bounced around state government after being initiated in 2007 by the Legislature. It landing with the attorney general in 2017. From 2014 to 2018, the job of inspector general was left vacant.
Then-Attorney General Derek Schmidt appointed an IG in 2018 and was responsible for selecting Anderson in 2021.
The 2025 Legislature expanded the mission of the inspector general’s office to search for potential fraud, waste, abuse and other illegal acts in the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF.
Lawmakers allocated $305,000 to expand the inspector general’s staff with an additional two auditors and one investigator in the current fiscal year to address the broadened mandate.
Anderson said it was his assumption the inspector general also would be available to explore fraud in the state’s free- and reduced-cost school lunch program.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100560-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-05 11:59:02.965606

Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” which was signed into law on July 4, put in place a one-year ban on Medicaid payments to health care providers who offer abortion care and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in 2023.
Planned Parenthood, which offers sexual and reproductive health care at nearly 600 health centers across the county, argued the policy was part of a yearslong plan to shut down the nonprofit, with the bill threatening to close 200 health centers across 24 states.

“Planned Parenthood provides thousands with necessary reproductive care and family planning services. The Trump administration’s move to withhold Medicaid funding puts necessary health care at risk. I am glad that the courts have thus far upheld this funding, but I am nonetheless concerned about future cuts to both Planned Parenthood and Medicaid. We must remain diligent,” state Rep. Laurie Pohustky (D-Livonia), the caucus’s chair, said in a statement on Wednesday. 
Pohustky pointed to additional Medicaid cuts in Republicans’ tax and spending bill, warning that millions will be removed from coverage. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, 10 million uninsured individuals are expected to lose Medicaid coverage over the next decade. 
“Planned Parenthood health centers are necessary for many across our state, and it is absolutely essential that patients who use Medicaid still have access to contraception, STI and cancer screenings and all the reproductive care they need and deserve,” Pohutsky said. 
23 states – including Michigan –  and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration late last month over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s provision to defund health centers like Planned Parenthood. 
“Planned Parenthood clinics are a critical part of Michigan’s healthcare system, delivering vital services to communities across the state,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. “The Trump Administration’s push to strip funding from these providers is an unlawful political tactic aimed at undermining care, even in states like Michigan, where the right to reproductive freedom is protected by our constitution. I remain committed to standing up for Michiganders’ ability to access the healthcare they need from the providers they trust.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Facetune_11-12-2023-10-28-51-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-05 11:59:02.965606

Historically redlined communities have less access to rapid emergency medical services, according to the findings of a new study. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.
The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico Medicaid Director Dana Flannery told the state Medicaid Advisory Committee on Monday the New Mexico Health Care Authority will need more staff to comply with the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law last month.
By Dec. 31, 2026, states must renew Medicaid recipients’ paperwork at least every six months. New Mexico currently confirms eligibility annually.
“When you enhance the frequency of those, the likelihood of more people falling off the rolls of Medicaid is much stronger,” Flannery said.
The new law also adds work requirements to the renewal process, meaning Medicaid recipients will have to prove they’ve completed 80 hours of work or community service per month, or meet exemption criteria to enroll in and maintain coverage. Flannery said the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has not yet offered guidance about what kind of proof people will need to qualify for an exemption.
While several parts of the new federal law will lead to people losing their health insurance, work requirements alone will result in approximately 88,000 people in New Mexico getting kicked off the rolls, Flannery said.
“This doesn’t mean, necessarily, that people aren’t doing the work requirements or aren’t already working,” she said. “A lot of people fall off of Medicaid due to not doing the paperwork required to stay.”
It will cost $32.7 million initially for New Mexico to change its system for administering these benefits, and $6.5 million each year thereafter, according to a preliminary cost estimate provided by Health Care Authority Director of Communications Marina Piña to Source NM.
Flannery told the committee she’s still working on an exact number of full-time workers she will need to increase the pace of processing Medicaid paperwork. Her agency is deciding whether to ask the federal government for an extension to delay the work requirements, she said.
Gary Housepian, executive director of Disability Rights New Mexico, told the committee his organization thinks many more people could lose their health insurance as a result of the new law, including those who don’t qualify for Social Security but are still disabled and won’t be able to meet the work requirements to receive Medicaid and SNAP.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Face the Nation on Sunday that there is “no real way to implement” the health care changes in the new law.
“It’s more paperwork for the federal government, for state governments, for county governments, for local hospitals, for independent providers,” Lujan Grisham said. “It’s more paperwork for everyone.”

Boston mayoral challenger Josh Kraft is looking to recharge his struggling campaign, but it's not clear how a speech he delivered on Sunday does much to juice his candidacy. 
The post Kraft 2.0 looks a lot like the first version   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS A REBOOT, it’s not clear it did much to clear the cache or restart the operating system.  
On Sunday, Josh Kraft gathered with supporters at the Ironworkers Local in South Boston to deliver what a press release billed as “an important campaign update and speech.” What followed in his remarks, however, was largely a restatement of positions he’s put forward on everything from rent control to bike lanes and the problems at Mass. and Cass.  
Kraft then turned to Mayor Michelle Wu and ripped her for spreading what the text of his speech called “falsehood after falsehood” about him. Kraft, who is Wu’s main opponent in this fall’s Boston mayoral election, took on the charge that he is “new to Boston,” questions about his family’s business dealings, and the relationship of his father, billionaire New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and Donald Trump.  
Kraft, who grew up in Boston’s tony suburbs and only moved into the city two years ago, ran through his admirable bio of decades of work in the city as CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Boston. Reminding voters at the same time of Wu’s far-away roots, the 58-year-old Kraft said he was walking truant kids to school in tough Boston neighborhoods when Wu, 40, was being walked to elementary school by her parents in the suburbs of Chicago.  
He emphasized that he has no involvement in his family’s business dealings and then took on the issue of his father’s longstanding friendship with Trump. Josh Kraft, who has made clear that he has never voted for Trump and objects to his policies, doubled down on distancing himself from his dad’s connections to the president. Trump has “actively attacked democratic institutions, and stoked hatred and division throughout our country,” Kraft said.    
It was stronger language than Kraft has used to date, and it left little doubt that he shares the revulsion toward Trump of many Boston voters, only 1 in 5 of whom cast a ballot for the president last November. But it didn’t seem like much of a reset or “Do-over debut,” as Politico Playbook headlined its write-up.  
“If you’re explaining, you’re losing” is a well-known axiom of campaign strategy.  
Whether it’s making clear that he does not share his dad’s views on Trump, or looking to undercut attacks that he only recently moved into the city by pointing out that he’s spent years working in Boston neighborhoods, Kraft still seems to be doing a lot of explaining, six months after launching his campaign.  
When it comes to Trump, he also has been dragged into an issue where he’s trying to score points on Wu’s playing field.  
Disdain for Trump isn’t something, on its own, that helps you stand out in a Boston election; it’s become a baseline requirement for entry in the race.  
Meanwhile, it’s hard to see how Kraft can score anti-Trump points against Wu after she stood her ground against Trump’s Republican attack dogs in testimony before a congressional committee in March on sanctuary city policies.   
Kraft also seems to be working overtime to emphasize his Democratic Party affiliation – something that’s usually a non-issue in Boston’s nonpartisan municipal elections. (It’s been more than 50 years since Boston last saw a serious Republican candidate for mayor, John Winthrop Sears, a Beacon Hill blueblood, who garnered 15 percent of the vote and finished third in the 1967 preliminary election.)  
Kraft’s campaign placards prominently promote “Josh Kraft – Democrat for Mayor,” as do the chyrons on his TV ads.  
His loud Democratic Party proclamations – which seem like a further bid to distance himself from all things Trump-related – are now drawing coverage, but not the kind Kraft is seeking.  
Today’s Globe reports that Kraft’s campaign has sent at least five different fundraising emails that pair a request to support his campaign with a plea for donations to prominent Democrats, including US Sen. Adam Schiff of California and former North Carolina governor Roy Cooper, who is now running for Senate there.  
The Globe says such “split list fund-raising” is not unusual in Democratic Party politics – but none of the five Democrats Kraft has linked his own pitch to has endorsed him or sanctioned the joint fundraising effort. Two of them, Schiff and US Rep. Eric Swalwell, asked Kraft to stop sending the emails. The Globe says it did not hear back from the other three Democrats on Monday.   
Kraft’s campaign called the emails a mistake and said it is ending its contract with the vendor that sent them.  
A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released last month had Kraft trailing Wu by 30 points. That’s a lot of ground to make up – and developments over the last few days don’t seem likely to move things in his direction.

When the market finally reopened Friday after a six-week closure, Media raced to borrow an extension cord and hook up to a neighboring vendor’s power outlet before sunset. After more than a month of lost income, she couldn’t afford to lose another day.
“I’m not someone who gives up,” Media said in her native Spanish.
The sprawling open-air market in North Las Vegas officially reopened to the public Friday evening after abruptly shutting down on June 21 — a week after Border Patrol agents carried out a raid at a swap meet in Southern California run by the same company that owns Broadacres Marketplace, Newport Diversified Inc.
Videos of the immigration sweep at the California swap meet were quickly posted on social media where vendors, customers and staff in Las Vegas watched with mounting concern. 
Some vendors stopped showing up amid fears that Broadacres could be next. Vendors who did continue operations said foot traffic and sales cratered as customers stayed home. The weekend before the market’s closure, Media said she only made $37 in sales — a fraction of what she typically makes selling jewelry and accessories.  
“A lot of people stopped coming. Sales dropped really bad. Everyone was scared, they’re still scared,” Media said.
Those same concerns led the owners of Broadacres Marketplace to temporarily shut down “out of an abundance of caution” for its vendors, customers, and staff — many of whom are immigrants or second-generation U.S. citizens with family members who are immigrants. 
“We don’t want any of our customers, vendors, or employees to be detained at our business,” the Broadacres Marketplace management team wrote on social media at the time.
Despite claims by the Trump administration that its primary concern is detaining and deporting violent criminals, about 40% of people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the last six months did not have criminal charges or convictions, according to data compiled by UC Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project.
Broadacres Marketplace is the largest open-air market in Nevada and one of the top private employers in North Las Vegas, but empty stalls on Friday underscored how immigrant-owned businesses have suffered sharp losses under the immigration crackdown.
Returning vendors were met with digital signs on Friday displaying information from legal aid groups, a clear indication of how much things have changed.
During the market’s closure, management said they partnered with legal experts and community advocates to develop a “vendor alert protocol” that will provide real-time updates on law enforcement activity in the area “within legal guidelines.”
“We’re reopening because our vendors are ready — and they deserve a marketplace that has their back,” said management in a statement on their website.
Educational materials will be available throughout the market to help vendors and customers better understand their legal rights, said management.
Vendors and customers who want more direction on how to handle encounters with law enforcement at the market can also take “Know Your Rights” training offered by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada in partnership with Broadacres Marketplace.

Agustin Ramirez has been selling fruits and vegetables at his Broadacres stand since 1994 — his most popular item are coconuts which are husked and served with lime and chili. But even sales for his signature product are slow with more customers staying away this summer.
As his sole source of income, the loss of customers at the stand is a big concern for Ramirez, but he’s optimistic he and his employees can weather the storm until the community feels safe enough to return. 
One sign of recovery was the steady stream of customers filing into the market as soon as it opened Friday evening, who were either pulled in by their loyalty to vendors they’ve frequented for years or by a  discounted $2 entry fee. (Tickets are normally $3 on Fridays, $2.50 on Saturdays and $3.50 on Sundays.) 
“With fear or without fear we have to keep living, we can’t shut ourselves inside for the rest of our lives,” Ramirez said in his native Spanish.
During the six week closure, Ramirez said he worked on preparing his undocumented employees with an exit plan in the event Broadacres is targeted by immigration officers. 
“We already have plans,” Ramirez said. “Whatever happens, they know where to go, where to run.”
Beyond the market’s role as an economic hub for immigrants, it has also created a sense of community for vendors and customers through the decades.
Before Media and her husband started their business at Broadacres four years ago they were customers for more than a decade. She remembers walking through the lines of vendors with her children, who now help run the business as adults.

Generations of families have memories of letting their children ride a pony at one of the oldest businesses in Broadacres Marketplace, a round plot of ground surrounded by asphalt — and more often than not — eager children.
Francisco Andredes, who grew up in rural Mexico, bought the business from the previous owner 14 years ago after his own children became frequent customers. It’s another example of how embedded the market has become in the Las Vegas immigrant community.
When Maribel Sanchez started her clothing business at Broadacres 25 years ago the market was much smaller than it is now. Its growth over the years shows the strength of the immigrant community, she said. 
The market must now recover under difficult circumstances, as the ongoing immigration raids at job sites that drove Broadacres managers to shut down in June show no sign of abating. 
Broadacres heavily publicized the market’s reopening and its new protocols meant to reassure vendors and customers, which Sanchez hopes will help increase business. Under a best case scenario, the market’s closure and then reopening will attract customers whos haven’t been in years, or new customers finding out about  the market for the first time.
“It’s like being in Mexico, it’s a beautiful place. I hope people will come,” Sanchez said.

Jared Polis discusses K-12 school funding with U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon at the National Governors Association meeting in Colorado Springs on July 25, 2025. (Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)As the 2024-25 chair of the National Governors Association, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, selected K-12 education as the priority of the NGA’s yearlong initiative. Titled “Let’s Get Ready! Educating all Americans for Success,” the project defined its purpose in its call to action: Identify solutions to address the belief that schools are not preparing graduates adequately for the work force today. 
The initiative had support from philanthropic foundations and companies that promote technology-related solutions, school choice, data-driven accountability, and other neoliberal market-based reforms in public education. One of the supporters, Stand Together Trust, founded by Charles Koch, provided millions to groups that back charter schools and other “alternatives to public education.” 
Many of the “project team” members were involved with organizations that prioritized “redesigning” the public education system. Polis has been a longtime supporter of expanding charter schools and workforce training as ways to address deficits in student outcomes, and eight of his staff worked on this project. Project team member Jen Walmer was on Polis’ staff in his first administration, and she worked previously as the Colorado director of Democrats for Education reform, which continues to call for Democrats to support school choice and charters.

The project team also included representatives from Watershed Advisors, All4Ed, Savi Advising, and the Urban Institute. Watershed’s CEO, Kunjan Narechania, was the CEO of the all-charter Recovery School District in New Orleans. Several Watershed and All4Ed staff either worked or trained in the Chiefs for Change program, which Jeb Bush founded to promote charter school models. All4Ed promotes online learning in both charter and district schools. 
Savi Advising’s founder, Archana Patel, worked for KIPP charter schools and was the senior director at the Broad Academy, a training ground for school leaders to promote charter schools. The Urban Institute published research that downplayed the effects caused by charter schools in exacerbating school segregation. The Institute received $11 million from the Walton Family Foundation and other foundations to identify “measures of students’ skills and competencies in prekindergarten (PK) through 12th grade that drive economic mobility.”  
Polis chaired seven “convening” sessions to determine the project’s outcomes. Featured “experts” at the sessions included Eva Moskowitz, founder of Success Academy Charter schools in New York; Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, a computer-based learning system; Geoffrey Canada, founder of Harlem Children’s Zone charter schools; John B. King, founder of the Uncommon schools charter chain; Angela Duckworth, co-founder with Dave Levin (KIPP charter school chain founder) of the now defunct Character Lab; and Steve Levitt, author of Freakonomics and a promoter of personalized AI tutoring. 
The final recommendations focused on four areas: academic foundations, workforce preparedness, civic engagement and lifelong well-being. The report offered a myriad of strategies to accomplish these goals: data tracking from early childhood through high school for work readiness, state dashboards, more testing and apprenticeships, increased use of technology, data analytics, performance management, and personalized learning. During the sessions, there were multiple examples of how to use private capital to facilitate desired outcomes.
On July 25, Polis presented the final report to the governors, and he invited Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to share her views. McMahon commented that a “return to shop classes” would serve some students better for their future job opportunities. She stated, “We have to rethink how we’re doing education … from beginning to end the goal is to get people into a productive job.” 
Charter schools were not directly highlighted in the final recommendations, yet McMahon stressed that the governors should open charter and micro schools, asserting that “states who do open more charter schools … see more and more progress being made in education.” McMahon also reassured Polis that Title V funding would be increased by $60 million to $500 million to expand and sustain more charter schools.  
Two days after the release of this report, the National Center for Charter School Accountability published the first of a three-part report detailing a nationwide decline in the number of charter schools since 2020. This new report questions the need for expanding charter schools considering their declining enrollment and financial difficulties. 
While workforce preparation is an important part of schooling, defining education primarily as a pipeline for economic productivity in the marketplace ignores the broader purposes of education. The Polis report neglects to focus on the essential role educators provide in developing positive relationships with students, and the benefits students gain through an emphasis on critical thinking, creativity, collaborative learning and exposure to the arts, social sciences and the humanities. Focusing primarily on charter schools as the answer to America’s problems in education negates the findings that 70% of parents are satisfied with their local public schools, as well as the research that charter schools have not proven to be the answer to America’s education problems. 
Will the NGA plans for “success” for America’s students become a reality?
Given the current economic and political climate from the federal government, significant traction on these ideas is uncertain. Chester Finn, the conservative, pro-choice voice with the Fordham Institute, said the report had some “good stuff,” but it also has “no real focus.” Last fall, Kent McGuire, education program director at the Hewlett Foundation, and former charter school educator Matt Wilka, described how “today’s youngest citizens … have been particularly ill-served by neoliberalism,” with its emphasis on “individual choice, standards, and competition.”  
Polis and McMahon seem to be promoting their own versions of neoliberal corporate educational solutions to enhance the private sector while ignoring the negative effects and the limitations of past reforms.

Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, walks into the Senate chamber on July 1, 2025. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Before the U.S. Senate began its August break, Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who heads the upper chamber’s appropriations committee, packed spending bills for the next fiscal year with millions of dollars for Maine, a tactic she’s become well-known for. 
Collins, who is up for reelection in 2026, has advanced more than $400 million in earmarks for the state and submitted requests for nearly $9 million more that will be considered when lawmakers return on Sept. 2. Millions of more dollars that would impact the Pine Tree State are also on the line through programmatic funding, additional federal grants and agency requests. 
But earmarks failed to be included last time around. And since resuming office, President Donald Trump has also cut otherwise congressionally appropriated funding for various grants and programs in Maine and nationally, an initial signal that Collins’ otherwise steadily growing appropriations power has been upended during Trump’s second term. 
Will this time be different? 
There’s initial momentum. On Friday, the U.S. Senate passed three of its 12 appropriations bills, the first time since 2018 that the body has passed an appropriations bill on the floor before the start of August recess. 
What’s explicitly at stake for Maine in these bills can be seen in earmarks, formally referred to as Congressionally Directed Spending, for community projects, but the state could also receive funding through programmatic and other funding included in the bills. 
Among the bills advanced is $9 million in earmarks for Maine in the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill and more than $25 million for Maine in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration bill. The Legislative Branch bill is the third that has passed so far but that proposal does not include earmarks.   
Including these three bills, the Senate Appropriations Committee has marked up eight of the 12 bills so far, a step that allows the other five proposals to advance to the full body when lawmakers return from their break. 
The eight draft bills include a total of $422 million in earmarks for Maine, and for the remaining four, Collins submitted nearly $9 million worth of requests, according to her office.
Will earmarks return?
One of the bills already marked up is the proposal to fund the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.
On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee largely rejected in this bill the Trump administration proposals to slash funding for education programs, medical research grants, health initiatives and Ukraine security assistance.
That bill includes $112.4 million in earmarks for Maine, with more than $13 million for health care workforce training and almost $71 million for Maine hospitals and health care centers. 
But recent history cautions those allocations may not come to fruition. 
This past winter, the continuing resolution from GOP leadership cut all earmarks for community projects. Collins had secured nearly $361 million in earmarks before they were removed from the resolution, which she said she ultimately supported to avoid a government shutdown. 
Congress is now in a similar place, again eyeing a possible government shutdown if it fails to pass appropriations bills by the end of the fiscal year on September 30. 
If Congress opts for a short-term continuing resolution to avoid that, it would push the deadline to approve earmarks to a later date, but another year-long stopgap bill could eliminate all earmarks.
When asked how confident Collins is that her earmarks will be included for the next fiscal year, Collins’ Communications Director Phoebe Ferraiolo said there could be a scenario where Congress decides to do a partial continuing resolution, which would mean passing some appropriations bills and then passing a stopgap agreement for the remaining ones.  
​​”Even if [Congressionally Directed Spending] is not included again this year, there are many other ways that Senator Collins will influence spending priorities,” Ferraiolo said. 
For example, defense spending is always outside the earmark process and a key deliverable that Collins’ supporters have long praised. 
Last week, the committee advanced the Defense Appropriations Act, which included billions of dollars in discretionary funding for Maine-based contractors such as Bath Iron Works, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Pratt & Whitney Workforce, as well as millions in funding for defense research at University of Maine.
Employees at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard told Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, and her colleagues during a tour of the facility last week that securing funding in the next budget is a key priority. 
“What we heard from workers and leadership was clear: they need stable funding, a reliable workforce pipeline, and a Congress that has their backs,” Pingree shared in a statement. 
Clawing back funding
But stable, reliable funding has become an anomaly during Trump’s second term, and so far efforts to restore many of the cuts have been piecemeal and often challenged in the courts.  
Regarding the bill to fund the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, for example, while the bill refutes many of the funding cuts from the Trump administration, the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, said it’s “only half of the equation” given that the administration “is intent on ignoring Congress, breaking the law, and doing everything it can without any transparency, to dismantle programs and agencies that help families.”
Congressional Republicans approved a recissions bill in July that cancelled $9 billion in funding for public media and foreign aid. Although a small slice of what the White House initially wanted, it represents a win for Trump and his efforts to claw back money approved in spending laws. Collins was one of two Republicans to vote against the bill. 
“Nobody really knows what program reductions are in it,” Collins said in a statement after the vote. “That isn’t because we haven’t had time to review the bill.  Instead, the problem is that [the U.S. Office of Management and Budget] has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process.”
When Collins outlined her strategy for navigating disagreements with the Trump administration for Maine Morning Star this past spring, she said she’s had some success restoring funding by having conversations outside of public view, relying on her long-developed relationships. 
“There is really no way to know how this will turn out — and that is true every year,” Ferraiolo said of 2026 fiscal year spending. “Each step is important — submitting request to the committee, getting it into the bill, having it survive the markup, getting the bill to the floor, having it survive conference, and having the bill signed by the president. We can never take any of these steps for granted, but each one gets us closer to success.”
Some voters have said Trump’s withholding of congressional appropriations and funding cuts underscored why Maine needs Collins, one of Congress’ most senior members and top appropriators. But others argued the executive’s actions have revealed a crack in Collins’ power.

State officials informed the Mississippi-based firm on July 22 that they were pursuing debarment, or permanently banning the company from participating in government contracts, according to a letter obtained by NC Newsline.
The notice from West Virginia comes four months after Horne settled litigation with the federal government, in which prosecutors alleged that the company created fictitious applicant information and filed fraudulent invoices as they managed federal disaster recovery grants.
Horne has denied any wrongdoing in the case, and settled for $1.2 million.
Samantha Willis, who leads West Virginia’s purchasing agency, wrote to Horne executives in the letter that the state had found “probable cause” to debar the company. She cited a press release from the federal prosecutor’s office about the settlement.
“The details uncovered during the investigation show clear and convincing evidence of a ‘wanton indifference’ to the interests of the public,” Willis wrote, “which caused serious harm to the public through the wasting of key disaster recovery resources through improper billing, or at least, a substantial likelihood of causing serious harm through the misuse of funds and delay in recovery for the communities involved.”

A spokesperson for Horne said in a statement that the company “strongly disagreed” with the notice and was preparing a formal response.
“The notice appears to rely solely on a press release related to a prior settlement, which itself contained no admission of wrongdoing and presented a one-sided characterization of events,” communications director Meg Annison said. “This reliance is not only legally insufficient — it is fundamentally unjust.”
“West Virginia law is clear: Debarment must be based on specific, substantiated grounds such as convictions for fraud, felony offenses related to public contracting, or other serious misconduct,” Annison continued. “None of these apply in our case. The settlement was reached voluntarily and without any finding of liability. It was a pragmatic resolution, not an acknowledgment of fault.”
Horne’s lawyers are in discussions with West Virginia officials and have “raised concerns about the timing and basis of this action,” she added. The company has 30 days since the letter was issued to submit their response.
“We are confident that once the full context is reviewed — including the terms of the settlement and our continued service to West Virginia agencies — the notice will be withdrawn,” Annison said.
West Virginia’s Department of Administration did not respond to requests for comment.
The West Virginia case dates to 2016, when Horne was contracted to manage federal disaster block grant money. Almost a decade later, North Carolina has tasked them with overseeing a recovery program funded with $1.4 billion from the same pool of federal money.

Horne had briefed North Carolina officials on the possibility of debarment in West Virginia, said a spokesperson for the NC Department of Commerce, which awarded the Helene recovery contract.
“The action has no effect on the company’s eligibility under a federal program like HUD’s (community development block grant disaster funds), and we do not expect it to have any effect on our current contract with Horne,” communications director David Rhoades said.
An inspector general’s report, previously reported by NC Newsline, said that the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development “will not pursue suspension or debarment action” against Horne. It was among the materials cited by a North Carolina-based firm that also bid on the contract and unsuccessfully protested Horne’s winning bid.
An attorney for Horne and North Carolina officials have pointed out that report does not contain official findings or recommendations from the inspector general’s office.
The company’s North Carolina contract came under scrutiny from state lawmakers shortly after it was awarded. Republican legislators remain wary of Horne’s involvement in prior hurricane recovery efforts that were defined for years by accounting errors and dysfunction. But both the company and state officials have said that the state agency ReBuild NC, not Horne, was directly responsible for those problems.

Federal records indicate Kate Cross, the owner of Cross Therapy Center in Council Bluffs, provides patients with counseling, psychotherapy and other services that are billed to Medicaid.
In July 2023, federal prosecutors charged Cross with health care fraud, alleging she had defrauded Medicaid by “upcoding” services, in part by deliberately overstating the length of telemedicine psychotherapy visits to collect a higher rate of reimbursement from Medicaid.
Prosecutors also alleged Cross had collected $14,000 from Medicaid for services that were not provided as billed.
In June 2024, Cross agreed to a plea deal that called for a recommended sentence of 24 months of probation. Later that month, she was sentenced to two years of probation, fined $9,500 and ordered to pay $11,255 in restitution.
One year later, in June 2025, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals, citing Cross’ 2024 conviction, charged her with failing to comply with the American Counseling Association’s code of ethics by submitting false reports to third parties.
To resolve the case without resorting to a hearing, the board recently agreed to a settlement that calls for Cross to retain her license to practice in Iowa subject to three years of probation, during which time she must engage a practice monitor to ensure she is complying with appropriate billing practices.
She is also required to complete six hours of training in ethics and pay a $250 civil penalty.

Jacky Rosen meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a Rosen visit to Israel, the West Bank, Jordan, and Iraq in May, 2025. (Photo posted by Rosen's U.S. Senate account on X).Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto were among a minority of Senate Democrats voting against efforts to block some additional weapons sales to Israel last week. 
A majority of Senate Democrats supported resolutions sponsored by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, to halt a $675 million bomb sale to Israel and shipments of 20,000 assault rifles. The U.S. has provided nearly $20 billion in military aid to Israel since the 2023 Hamas attacks. 
Rosen and Cortez Masto, along with several other Democrats and every Republican, voted against the efforts, which ultimately failed. 
In an email to Nevada Current Monday, a spokesperson for Rosen said the senator believes the U.S. must “continue supporting our ally Israel and its security and, at the same time, continue working to make sure that significantly more humanitarian aid — especially food — reaches Palestinian civilians.”
Rosen “also believes the U.S. should continue pushing for actions that stop civilian suffering, bring the hostages home, and bring an end to this war,” the statement said. 
Cortez Masto’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment. 
Last week’s effort to prevent authorizing additional U.S. weapons deliveries to Israel came as Israel has repeatedly inhibited the delivery of food and aid relief to Gaza, which has led to mass starvation among Palestinians and added to the death toll.  
Growing support to prevent arms from being sold to Israel – 27 Democrats voted to stop the sale of assault rifles while 24 voted for the resolution to prevent the sale of bombs – reflects a more noticeable shift in congressional perspectives on Israel’s military actions.
Even Nevada’s Senate Democrats, among the body’s most moderate, have indicated increasing apprehension over Israel’s Gaza policies.
The day before their votes to provide more weapons to Israel, Rosen and Cortez Masto were two of 44 Democrats who signed a July 29 letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff calling for a “large-scale expansion of humanitarian assistance” in Gaza.
“The acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza is also unsustainable and worsens by the day,” the senators wrote. “Hunger and malnutrition are widespread, and, alarmingly, deaths due to starvation, especially among children, are increasing.”
The letter also noted the failure of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is funded by the U.S. and administered by Israel, and has been charged with providing aid in Gaza.
The foundation “has failed to address the deepening humanitarian crisis and contributed to an unacceptable and mounting civilian death toll around the organization’s sites. To prevent the situation from getting even worse, we urge you to advocate for a large-scale expansion of humanitarian assistance and services throughout the Gaza Strip, including through the use of experienced multilateral bodies and NGOs that can get life-saving aid directly to those in need and prevent diversion,” the senators wrote.
The letter also called for “support of diplomatic efforts to return all hostages.” 
Rosen also recently cited “the need to ensure humanitarian aid directly reaches the Palestinians who need it the most.” 
Since the Hamas attacks, Rosen, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has strongly backed Israel and defended the actions of the Israeli government.
Rosen joined six other senators in May 2024 to condemn the International Criminal Court, which sought arrest warrants against Israeli leaders for alleged crimes against humanity in Gaza.
In a letter signed by Republican and Democratic senators including Rubio, still a senator at the time, Rosen and her colleagues called the court’s action “judicial overreach” and urged then-President Joe Biden “to protect our ally and American interests.”
“Israel has exercised its right under international law to self-defense in response to an armed attack. Israel has taken significant actions to protect Palestinian lives as Hamas uses civilians as human shields,” the senators wrote.
Rosen again blasted the ICC’s “outrageous” actions in November when it issued the arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant
Hamas militants attacked southern Israel Oct. 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 people in the attack. Since then, an estimated 60,000 Gazans, including 18,500 children, have been killed. 
The United Nations has reported 90% of 2.1 million residents in Gaza have been displaced. 
Last week was not the first time multiple Senate Democrats have attempted, and failed, to block weapons sales to Israel. 
Humanitarian aid and international groups, such as Human Rights Watch, have long warned Israel was mass starving Gaza as a weapon of war. 
As the crisis in Gaza has intensified in recent weeks, there have been more images and reports of mass famine caused by Israel. Several international groups, including two prominent Israeli human rights groups, have called Israel’s actions genocide.
Meanwhile public support for increased military action for Israel has also faded.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In a new administrative action, Gov. Mike Dunleavy is ordering “efficiency reviews” of state agencies and asking departments to use artificial intelligence software as part of an effort to identify budget cuts.
The reviews will take place annually, according to Dunleavy’s new administrative order, published Monday, and would become part of the state’s annual budget process.
The reviews will initially focus on “grants to non-State of Alaska entities” and “accounts payable,” according to a copy of the text available online.
The reviews are intended to “identify potential savings” and “improve efficiency of operations” but also will include recommendations for the state to contract out services rather than performing them in-house.
“Alaskans expect their government to deliver essential services in the most efficient and responsible way possible,” Dunleavy said in a written statement announcing the administrative order. “This order ensures we prioritize critical needs, eliminate waste, and safeguard the state’s financial stability.”
Some prior outsourcing efforts by the Dunleavy administration have seen state services assigned to call centers outside Alaska, drawing opposition from union officials and legislators. 
A second order, also released Monday, calls for the state to significantly reduce the number of regulations it has on the books.
Notably, the order says that the state should speed permitting for projects regulated by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation and Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
That could mean automatically approving projects even if their environmental review hasn’t been completed according to timelines required by the state, the order says.
Dunleavy leaves office on Dec. 6, 2026. The order says that the state should “reduce the number of regulatory requirements by 15% by Dec. 31, 2026, and 25% (cumulative) by Dec. 31, 2027.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.










We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce


“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
A slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
68-turbine, $621 million wind project approved in northeast South Dakota

Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison has appealed the nearly three-year sentence he received for his role in the 2020 police raid that killed Breonna Taylor, an unarmed Black woman. 
The notice of appeal, filed Tuesday, comes after U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings last month sentenced Hankison to 33 months in prison for violating Taylor’s civil rights during the raid. 
Former police officer involved in Breonna Taylor raid gets 33 months sentence

Hankison “appeals both the conviction and the sentence imposed in this case,” the notice says. He was sentenced to 33 months in prison and three years of supervised release in July.  
In handing down that sentence, Jennings, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the U.S. Department of Justice’s recommendation that Hankison be sentenced to a single day of time served.  
On the night Hankison and others came to Taylor’s apartment in March 2020 with a “no-knock” search warrant, police were investigating a former boyfriend of Taylor’s who lived at a different address. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were in bed when police broke into the apartment. Walker fired at what he thought were intruders breaking into the residence, striking Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in his thigh. Mattingly initially sued Walker but dropped the case voluntarily in 2023. 
Hankison and two other officers fired their guns a total of 32 times. Hankison fired from outside the apartment through a covered sliding glass door and window, hitting a neighbor’s apartment. It was later determined that officer Myles Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Taylor, whose death led to massive protests in Louisville and beyond. He was not charged and was later hired by a police force in Carroll County.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As Pennsylvania and other states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.










We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce


“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
A slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
Trump aims to shut down state climate policies

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

Amid decreasing demand and rising costs, the U.S. and California wine industry have struggled in recent years. But while some in the industry regard President Donald Trump’s tariff policies as bad for business, others say they could help domestic wine makers, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Since the beginning of August, the Trump administration has enacted a 15% tariff on most European goods, including wine. Though negotiations remain ongoing, some American winemakers, restaurant owners and others are urging Trump to exclude European wines from tariffs because of the ripple effects it could have on the wine business ecosystem.
In California especially — which leads the U.S. in wine-related tourism and exports — wine importers, distributors, retailers and restaurants rely on selling European wines for revenue. Their ability to distribute American wine is also influenced by how much other wine they can move.

Paul Einbund, owner of two Bay Area restaurants: “A lot of my diners just won’t drink domestic (wine). … People up and down the supply chain are in trouble.”

In 2022, California’s wine industry generated about $88 billion and the state’s wine exports totaled $1.3 billion.
But others aren’t entirely convinced that exempting European wines from tariffs would help the ailing industry in the U.S. They argue that since European winemakers are subsidized, California wine producers are already at a disadvantage. The European Union spends more than 1 billion euros a year to help boost European wine, and some countries have their own subsidy programs. 

Richard Samra, a grape grower in the Sacramento Delta and Lodi for 40 years: “U.S. wine grape growers don’t have that. We want to level the playing field. We have plenty of grapes and wine available for sale.”

From CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn:
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has sued the Trump administration 37 times in 28 weeks, staving off the president’s efforts to freeze as much as $168 billion in federal funding to California.That litigation has cost about $5 million — part of the $25 million the state Legislature sent Bonta’s office in early 2025 to bolster California’s legal war chest against anticipated Trump actions.Bonta’s office documented its legal victories and setbacks in a report submitted to the Legislature last week.The avoided federal cuts largely stem from a multi-state lawsuit co-led by California to block the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze $3 trillion in federal funding. Bonta’s efforts also helped to restore some federal science funding for universities, while other dollars are still stalled.The $5 million has been spent on legal staff at the state’s Department of Justice and no money has gone toward outside counsel, Bonta said at a Monday press conference.

Bay Area case challenges CA approach to affordable housing

One of the most common methods California uses to create affordable housing could be thrown into question by a recent lawsuit challenging the city of East Palo Alto’s authority to charge a housing fee.
As CalMatters’ Ben Christopher explains, about 149 California cities and counties have “inclusionary zoning” rules that require developers of new housing projects to pay for the state’s shortage of affordable homes. Developers typically do this by setting aside a portion of new units for lower-income tenants, but they can also pay a fee if they refuse.
Last week, East Palo Alto resident Wesley Yu filed a lawsuit in federal court after the city’s inclusionary zoning rules required him to sell or rent out one of the two housing units he was planning to build at an “affordable” rate. If not, he’d have to pay a $54,891 one-time fee.
Describing the fee as “extortion,” Yu and his legal team are relying on a U.S. Supreme Court decision to refute the zoning rules. The high court ruled last year that local governments must show that certain fees they charge builders must be “roughly proportionate” to the fiscal impact of the development.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) is urging residents to get vaccinated amid the confirmation of the first measles cases in the state this year and as families begin back-to-school preparation with vaccine rates still down.
DHS confirmed nine cases of measles in Oconto County over the weekend — the first cases in the state this year. The agency said no public points of exposure have been identified and the risk to the community remains low.
The first case was confirmed through testing at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, and the eight other cases were confirmed based on exposure and symptoms. Each person was exposed from a common source during out-of-state travel.
Dr. Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer of DHS’s Bureau of Communicable Diseases, told reporters during a press conference Monday afternoon that given the number of cases across the country, the agency has been preparing for its case investigations and outbreak response for months.
“While we were surprised that we had our first cases this past week, we were prepared,” Westergaard said. “We’ve been making sure that we have adequate MMR vaccine in stock and have worked in partnership with all of our local and tribal health departments to make sure that we have a solid response that everyone is aware of, and so far for this case,… things have gone well.”
Cases of the highly contagious disease have hit a 33-year high nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There are reports of over 1,300 cases this year, with more than 150 people having been hospitalized for measles. Three people have died this year.
Measles was declared eliminated in 2000, but decreasing vaccine rates, which have fallen below herd immunity, have led to a resurgence of the disease. Prior to 2025, the last similar outbreak was in 2019 when more than 1,200 cases were confirmed in the U.S.
Westergaard said the state agency is not considering the nine cases in Wisconsin an outbreak because the investigation found a common source during out-of-state travel. He said the agency won’t be releasing additional information about the cases due to state privacy laws. The agency has said it is working to identify and notify people who may have been exposed.
The agency is urging families to get vaccinated in light of the cluster of cases and reported Monday that vaccination rates among students mostly held steady during the 2024-25 school year. Vaccination rates are still below pre-pandemic levels.
“Vaccination is the first line of defense for your child’s health. Each vaccine is approved only after being proven safe and effective,” Stephanie Schauer, director of the Wisconsin Immunization Program, said in a statement. “Taking time now to ensure your children have received the recommended vaccines will make them less likely to get seriously ill, meaning less time out of school and away from work. And routine vaccines don’t just protect your child — they help keep classrooms and the whole community safe.”
Measles can spread from person to person through the air, and the vaccines to prevent it are highly effective. One dose of the MMR vaccine provides about 93% protection from measles, while two doses are about 97% effective.
Children’s Wisconsin President of Pediatrics Dr. Mike Gutzeit emphasized that serious side effects from the MMR vaccine are rare.
“The risk from measles itself is far greater. When families choose not to vaccinate, they’re not just putting their own children at risk, but also newborns and people with weakened immune systems,” Gutzeit said. “Measles was nearly eliminated in the U.S., but now we’re seeing hundreds of cases and hospitalizations again. We can’t afford to go backward.”

Redistricting — the art of drawing the district boundaries that determine representation — is messy, opaque, confusing, and inherently political. It typically happens only once a decade in each state, after the census produces new demographic data.
But that once-a-decade cadence now looks like the next political norm to fall.
It’s customary for the party in control of redistricting to draw maps that weaken the voting power of the opposition while maximizing its own political advantage. Gains in technology and data have made it possible to draw lines ever more precisely. “I define redistricting as the only legalized form of vote-stealing left in the United States today,” said the late Thomas Hofeller, a prominent Republican redistricting consultant — in 1991.
Even so, recent events suggest the current no-holds-barred political climate could take the partisan machinations of redistricting to a higher level.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott cited constitutional concerns when he called a special session of the state Legislature to draw new congressional maps, but there is also a clear political motive that Republicans haven’t been shy about discussing. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. The midterm elections are nearing, and the party in power typically loses seats. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has said that the Texas GOP should seek to redraw the lines in a way that allows them to add as many as five seats to the Republican column. A proposed map released this week aims to fulfill that objective.
Trump is reportedly also urging other Republican-controlled states, including Missouri, to consider redistricting in a way that would boost the GOP’s chances of picking up seats, though that could mean some incumbents will have to run in more competitive districts. Ohio is engaged in a legally mandated redistricting that Republicans, who control the process, also hope will yield more seats.
This has set off a sort of redistricting arms race, with Democratic leaders in other states saying they could redraw lines to offset Republican gains. Importantly, leaders in some states that have tried to make redistricting less partisan — by shifting control to commissions or adopting other limitations — are suggesting they intend to sidestep them.
For example, California has used an independent redistricting commission for decades, but Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said the heavily Democratic state must respond to the push in Texas by drawing new maps that benefit Democrats.
They’re not screwing around,” Newsom said. “We can’t afford to screw around either. We have got to fight fire with fire.”
Newsom and other Democratic leaders have said they’re seeking workarounds that would allow a midcycle redistricting in the state. For example, the state attorney general said he believes lawmakers could draw new maps that would be put before voters in a special election.
Democratic governors in Illinois, New York, and New Jersey have also said they’re exploring options, but the barriers are higher than in Texas.
In most of the states under Democratic control, maps already heavily favor Democrats — as in Illinois — or the legislature has limited authority over redistricting. Changing that on a timeline that would allow new maps for the midterms would be difficult.
One thing is certain: Any new maps are likely to face court challenges over how political power is distributed among districts. Those will come at a time when the Supreme Court may be poised to consider another challenge to the landmark Voting Rights Act.
At the end of the last term, the justices didn’t rule on a high-profile Louisiana redistricting case, instead announcing they would hear new arguments on it during the 2025-26 term.
Other redistricting cases, too, could be headed to the court. In the end, it’s hard to tell what will happen, except that voters — who have packed Texas legislative hearings on the redistricting proposal, even before proposed maps were released — may not have much say.

Prisoners followed suit with their own plans to beautify the place with world-class murals.,"In summary
California committed more than $200 million toward refashioning San Quentin as a hub for rehabilitation. Prisoners followed suit with their own plans to beautify the place with world-class murals.


About a month after I earned my parole and was released from High Desert State Prison in 2024, my buddy Kai Bannon called me from San Quentin through the institutional phone portal. My eyes welled with emotion at being on the other side of these monitored calls for the first time as a free person.
Kai co-founded San Quentin SkunkWorks — a nonprofit social innovation lab focused on introducing and testing moonshot reform ideas, and he and his inside team embarked on a series of community-oriented projects within the prison.
Now Kai wanted my help to realize a bold new vision — to rehabilitate the 19th century architectural landscape of San Quentin by infusing it with light, color, beauty and art.
Gov. Gavin Newsom committed $240 million toward renovating the state’s oldest prison and rebranding it as San Quentin Rehabilitation Center. His plan includes a new multi-building educational complex, as well as repurposing the former Death Row condemned housing unit into living quarters for the general population.
But it doesn’t include changing the drab beige and brown exteriors that surround residents whenever they leave their tiny dark cells, which were built in the late 1800s. The physical environment still signifies oppression, confinement, punishment.
With so much attention focused on the new buildings set to open in early 2026, Kai began to envision SkunkWorks as a platform that might aesthetically elevate the older, less glamorous parts of the facility.
He christened the project Chiaroscuro: Light Within the Shadows. An Italian term of art, chiaroscuro describes the graphic interplay between light and dark highlights. Metaphorically, it underscores the bright juxtapositions of humanity that live deep within our prisons.
We needed to meet two objectives simultaneously: 1) reach out to global artists to see who’d be interested in working inside an incarcerated community; and 2) figure out how to convince prison administrators that our project had merit.
From Dubai to the U.K. to California, world renowned muralists responded. The concept intrigued them, and they wanted to find out more about San Quentin. They wanted to understand the community they might soon visit and hope to inspire through art. The Skunks collected stories of the individuals living inside San Quentin — including officers and staff who spend large chunks of their days working alongside residents.
Much to our amazement, prison officials agreed we were on the right path. With their support, we gained approval for photos and design layouts of the facility to be shared with prospective artists.
“The murals aren’t just about making the place look better. They change the mood out here,” said San Quentin Correctional Sgt. Freddy Brenes. “A calmer yard means a safer yard — for staff and for the people living here.”
We soon felt an immediate connection with Faith XLVII, a South African artist known for creating community-inspired street murals on public wall spaces and buildings.
“My personal view is just that art has been and is, in all traditional societies, very much a part of the cultural fabric of life and the processes of life,” Faith said. “It’s cathartic; it’s therapeutic; it’s psychological. It speaks in a visual language that negates words and can speak directly to the heart through metaphors and symbols.”

Faith already had a planned trip to San Francisco in June for a gallery exhibit, so talks quickly evolved. Would it be possible to create a mural on a San Quentin wall in July? We’d need clearcut approval by the administration. We’d also need to raise funds to cover materials and costs.
Kai and his team launched a grassroots social media campaign asking for donations. Because it was the debut installment of Chiaroscuro, we felt an added pressure to pull it off without much hitch.
SkunkWorks raised thousands of dollars by June. A percentage of that came from dozens of residents who filled out donation slips inside the facility for money to be deducted from their institutional trust accounts.
“It’s actually kind of cool,” Kai told me. “A number of people came by and said they gave five bucks or 10 bucks. Those are small amounts for people on the outside. But you and I both know how much five or 10 bucks means in here.”
In addition to Faith, we partnered with Shannon Riley, one of the co-founders of Building 180 — an art production and consulting agency responsible for coordinating public art installations all around the world.
With Riley’s outreach, Dunn-Edwards Paints sponsored most of the paint for the mural. Their local distributors mixed and prepared custom colors along with a UV protective finishing coat.
“I think placing art in public spaces can really help connect people in meaningful ways,” said Riley. “It sparks conversation and dialogue, curiosity and confidence — all really important for healing and rehabilitation.”
Faith’s son, Keya Tama, came from New York to help paint. One of the SkunkWorks outside volunteers who was traveling abroad donated her Sausalito residence for them to stay in comfortable accommodations close to San Quentin.

An artist himself, Keya felt compelled to install his own mural after speaking about the project with residents and staff.
“As soon as I saw the wall, I kind of just had a feeling,” he said. “Much more like finding something that needed to be there — or had always needed to be there.”
‘Like a piece of freedom’
The Faith XLVII mural stands on the outside of West Block, where more than half the population passes back and forth on any normal day.
George Mesro Coles-El has lived in San Quentin for 13 years, and in all that time, the large blank walls seemed to represent only institutionalization and despair.
“To be able to come out over these last few days and see a mural on the wall in front of me — like when I come and get that first fresh breath of air in the morning, it’s really impactful for me,” said Coles-El. “I never thought I would see a mural like that in a dismal place like prison.”
Coles-El, Tony Haro and Luis Maya all worked with Faith XLVII and Keya Tama. They helped organize and prepare the paint, maintained the brushes and rollers and got a chance to color different segments.
“You get to see something just so different, like a piece of freedom,” said Haro. “We’re going back and forth looking at this beautiful mural that has a quote that’s saying ‘the heart of the world,’ you know? The other day, somebody asked me what does that mean?
“And I said listen to what they’re saying, bro — wherever you’re at, you’re the heart of the world. We’re the heart of the world. You carry that with you.”
More than simply transforming the physical surroundings, the mural also helped shift cultural perceptions.
“I honestly have a newfound respect for staff,” said Maya. “A lot of them took extra efforts to see the project through —  just being able to be flexible, being receptive of communication. And then seeing how officers need a new change of scenery as much as us.” 
A goodbye through a gate
On July 11, San Quentin Rehabilitation Center planned a media event to celebrate the murals. Faith and a news photographer waited outside but were told no guests would be allowed in that day because of an unexpected modified lockdown.

But Associate Warden Yaser Samara called and asked them to come back. Despite the lockdown, he was ready to help Faith get photos and commemorate her art before she returned to South Africa.
“I’m sure there’s many perspectives on this, but at least in my experience with the warden, assistant warden and guards — I met some pretty special people who seemed to want to also bring changes to the system,” said Faith. “And that was very inspiring to me to see that.”
But because of the modified lockdown, Kai was not allowed to be outside when photos were taken. He saw Faith through a locked gate, and she came over to say goodbye and shake his hand through the thick iron bars.
“It’s not how I imagined this ending,” he told me. “But maybe it said everything — that like even in this place that’s built to separate us, we’ve still found a way to connect.
“And I think that the handshake said more than words ever could. It’s gratitude. It’s grief. It’s a whole project in a single gesture reaching across boundaries and trying to create something beautiful, even when the system tries to keep you apart.”

(Artist rendering courtesy of Dominion Energy)Soon, Richmond Flying Squirrels baseball fans will only need to look up, towards the top of the new stadium, to see Dominion Energy’s latest attempt to bring more power to the grid via renewable sources.
Arrays with a total of 1,700 solar panels will be installed on top of the stadium, slated to be built next year, and in the parking lot. They will produce one megawatt of energy that can provide power for an estimated 250 homes at peak output. While the project is small, Dominion said every bit helps in the rising demand for power.
“Every single megawatt counts, every single electron counts, and this Squirrels solar project is one way we’re making the energy we’re delivering to our Richmond customers clean and affordable and supporting our overall mission,” said Austin Jones, a manager of business development with Dominion.
The company has been striving to utilize urban areas where solar power can be produced, which would add to its solar initiatives in more rural areas. 
Dominion has multiple large-scale solar farms across the commonwealth. A spokesman for the company said they have the third largest solar fleet among utilities in the country, with more than 70 facilities in the state that can power 750,000 homes at peak output. However there are not many projects within cities; the stadium project is the first for Dominion in Richmond. The arrays are a step towards increasing those numbers and revamping the use of parking lots and rooftops in cities across the state.
“Like in a baseball stadium, take something people love, this incredibly joyful thing, and pair it with clean energy,” Jones said.
These arrays will not be powering the stadium itself, but rather will be put onto the grid at large. The project will need approval from the City of Richmond and the State Corporation Commission in order to move forward, which is typical for any energy project. So far, it appears the city government is on board.
“This solar project represents the kind of integrated, collaborative approach that’s essential to achieving Richmond’s clean energy goals,” said Laura Thomas, Director of the City of Richmond’s Office of Sustainability. “It’s a great example of how public, private, and community partners can come together around a shared vision for a more resilient, sustainable future.”
CarMax Park, the new stadium for the Squirrels, is anticipated to be completed in early 2026 as part of the city’s new Diamond District that is under construction now.
“We’re proud to partner with Dominion Energy Virginia to bring a new solar array to CarMax Park, further cementing Richmond’s leadership in clean energy,” Flying Squirrels Managing Partner Lou DiBella said. “This project isn’t just about what happens inside the ballpark; it’s about stepping up as a community partner and using our platform to help bring clean energy to the city.”

,California,2025-08-05 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,LA County repealed its own justice reforms. Restoring them would require a shaky electorate,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/la-county-repealed-justice-reform/,An unfathomable drafting blunder could wreck years of work to make Los Angeles County government more responsive. Restoring them will be difficult.,"An unfathomable drafting blunder threatens to wreck years of painstaking work to make Los Angeles County government more responsive to the needs of its 10 million people. The magnitude of the screw-up, which became public last month, is slowly coming into focus. 
There may be nationwide repercussions.
At issue are two ballot measures, each of them drafted by L.A. County’s lawyers and each of them amending the county charter. Measure J, adopted by voters by a healthy margin amid the “reckoning” of 2020, commits a significant chunk of the county budget each year to repairing generations of economic and racial injustice through mandatory spending on health care, housing, job training and alternatives to incarceration. 
Measure J makes L.A. County stand apart. Other state and local governments made symbolic gestures toward systemic reform during the heady and chaotic months following the police murder of George Floyd and the protests calling for government to redesign how it serves marginalized communities. 
Few actually did anything substantive. But with Measure J, L.A. County put its money where its mouth is.
And then, last November, Measure J was stupidly overwritten by Measure G, which will expand the Board of Supervisors and create an elected chief executive and an ethics commission. 
The goal is to make county government more accountable by finally imposing the same checks and balances that Americans take for granted in other levels of government. We elect the president, the governor, the mayor. We will now elect a county executive, and a larger Board of Supervisors will scrutinize that person’s performance.
The two important measures cover very different ground and ordinarily wouldn’t cancel each other out — except for the fact that the county’s lawyers drafted ‘G’ to be put in exactly the same place in the charter that was already occupied by ‘J.’ So when a principal part of ‘G’ becomes effective in December 2028, it will repeal ‘J.’
Don’t worry, county lawyers said in a statement. “As a practical matter, the repeal would have no impact,” given that the Board of Supervisors can just keep spending as though Measure J remains in place.
That misses the point, as the lawyers surely know. Measure J was meant to bind all future Boards of Supervisors, allowing long-term planning and budgeting for ongoing programs. Without it, future supervisors can shift spending elsewhere whenever the political winds change and it’s no longer fashionable to dismantle racial inequity. 
And isn’t that where we are now? The spirit of 2020 is a distant memory. Democratic lawmakers are back to writing tough-on-crime bills, public attention has turned to fires and floods, and municipal budgets are strapped.
And more to the point, President Trump is steamrolling over anything that strikes him as “woke,” including health funding, care for the mentally ill, housing for the homeless and, most especially, “DEI” — diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives of the sort proudly championed by Los Angeles County and funded by Measure J. 
As the nation’s largest local government, and with Measure J as its standard, L.A. County was a Noah’s Ark to protect and sustain the spirit of 2020 through the storms of Trumpism, an ambassador to the rest of the nation of equity and justice programs. L.A. County, standing firm, could conceivably help other state and local governments find their backbones.
But instead, the ballot measure fiasco tosses culture war crusaders an unearned win. It puts at risk the tenuous and hard-won trust between L.A.’s community activists, county officials and employees — and to some extent even law enforcement, who came together in the name of health-based alternatives to incarceration. The drafting error means the Reimagine L.A. Coalition that organized support for Measure J may have to go back to the ballot to re-do what they already did. They are understandably angry at the prospect.
And because times have changed, it’s by no means certain that voters would pass Measure J a second time. Or, for that matter, Measure G. Seven months into the bellicose second Trump administration, L.A. voters may have second thoughts about strong executive power. 
LA County moves too slow and too fast
There is now tension between champions of each charter amendment, and open talk about which measure should be scrapped in order to preserve the other.
As the mayor of West Hollywood in 2020, testifying in favor of Measure J, Lindsey Horvath called on the Board of Supervisors to put it on the ballot. “Systems of care and systems of accountability must go hand in hand,” she told the board.
Four years later, as a county supervisor, Horvath led the effort for Measure G. She was correct — care and accountability, ‘J’ and ‘G,’ should complement one another.
A careless drafting error puts them at odds.
Supervisor Kathryn Barger opposed putting both measures on the ballot, arguing that they were slapped together in haste, with insufficient time for vetting.
She, too, is correct.
But it’s worth remembering that in January 2023, the Board of Supervisors commissioned a study of L.A. County governance in order to improve transparency, representation and ethics. A year and a half later, the county had not even hired a contractor to do the study. It may take a little haste to break that kind of maddening stasis.
Los Angeles County moves simultaneously too slow and too fast, and as a consequence accomplishes too little of its leaders’ lofty and laudable goals. Was it too fast ordering up Measure G, leaving the lawyers too little time to realize they were overwriting Measure J? Or too slow in putting Measure J in the charter, so that the lawyers had no idea that it was there when they put Measure G in the same spot?
The County Counsel’s Office blames the mess on the board’s clerk for not updating the charter, even though the lawyers not only wrote Measure J, but lived with it every day for three years as it was nullified in trial court and revived in the Court of Appeal in July 2023. It’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t remember it a year later, or that they had no duty to discover it, when they plopped Measure G on top of it.
A Governance Reform Task Force has been meeting to flesh out the details of implementing Measure G. Its three meetings so far seem to underscore the ongoing battles over ‘J’ and ‘G,’ well after the elections are over. At its first meeting, about a third of the members revealed that they had voted against the measure, or represented organizations that opposed it. At its second meeting, one of its members reported the drafting error that seems likely to doom Measure J, or Measure G, or both.
At the third meeting, three lawyers from the Office of County Counsel were prepared to offer the task force a preliminary report on what happened and what might be done to rectify the situation. They waited patiently through three hours of discussion about committee assignments.
And then the audio crew had to leave, and the meeting came to an abrupt end without the lawyers’ report. Apparently, nobody had thought about the audio crew. It was a very Los Angeles County moment — and another reminder that the nation’s largest local jurisdiction is badly in need of a revamp.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/100323-Lindsey-Horvath-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-05 08:57:50.728878

American wine industry stakeholders have different opinions about the potential fallout from tariffs on European wine, with California likely feeling the biggest impact.


Tariffs on European wine could be good or bad for California wine producers, depending on whom you ask. 
Some American winemakers, restaurateurs and others are urging President Donald Trump to exclude wine from tariffs on goods from Europe, saying European wines are important to the health of domestic wines.
But not all California wine producers are on board. They argue that European winemakers are already subsidized, so American companies having to bear tariffs on just about everything else — including imported corks, barrels and other supplies — puts wine producers in high-cost California at an even bigger disadvantage.
For some wine growers, “it’s certainly hard to hear” about other U.S. wine and hospitality industry players pushing for “zero-for-zero” tariffs on European wines, said Natalie Collins, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, which has 650 members. She said it’s tough for California winemakers to price their products to compete with those from Europe. 
Trump recently said that he had reached a tariff agreement with the European Union, but some details have yet to be released, including possible exceptions. For now, the EU says the 15% tariffs that went into effect at the beginning of August apply to wine, though negotiations reportedly continue. The U.S. wine industry, which has been facing myriad challenges including new studies that say alcohol is bad for people’s health, falling demand and growing costs, is taking this opportunity to ask for help.

“We’ve seen two years in a row of declining wine consumption in the United States for the first time in two generations,” said Jason Haas, co-owner of Tablas Creek Vineyard in Paso Robles. “It shows up in less tourism, fewer people visiting wineries, fewer people ordering over e-commerce, less sales through wholesalers, both restaurant and retail,” Haas added.
That’s the ecosystem the U.S. Wine Trade Alliance and other industry groups are saying will feel the pain if European wine prices rise because of tariffs: thousands of wine importers and distributors, tens of thousands of wine retailers and hundreds of thousands of restaurants. California, the nation’s leader in wine-related tourism and exports, could be most affected. WineAmerica, an industry group, said California’s wine industry generated about $88 billion in economic impact in 2022. The state’s wine exports in 2022 totaled $1.3 billion, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
Katie Lazar co-manages the 45-year-old Cain Vineyard & Winery in St. Helena in the Napa Valley. 
“We’re a long-term business,” Lazar said during a recent media briefing, echoing what other winemakers said about how growing grapes and making wine takes years. “It takes (the wine industry) so long to react and be able to change that the chaos that is present now is an existential threat to the world that we live in.” 
Winemakers like Lazar say the distributors they rely on to sell their wines need revenue from selling European wines as well. Their ability to distribute domestic wine is tied to how much other wine they have coming in, she said in an interview with CalMatters. 
Most of the U.S. alcohol industry has a three-tier structure that dates back to the repeal of Prohibition. Winemakers and producers are the first tier, followed by distributors and retailers. All three are facing the uncertainty brought about by tariffs: Some wine imports are on hold, meaning less revenue for distributors and retailers.

“I’ve never felt so interconnected like I feel now, even with competitors,” said Matt Licklider, proprietor of LIOCO in Healdsburg, a winemaker that sources its grapes from various small vineyards in California. He said his winery sells to 40 distributors, some of which didn’t know whether they would have revenue coming in from imports because of the unknowns around tariffs. So some of those distributors are ordering less from him. “It has put distributors in a more conservative mindset, which doesn’t benefit anyone here,” Licklider said. 
For restaurants that have very thin margins, marking up certain items such as wine can help them survive. Licklider said over the years, he has seen restaurant markups go from two to three times to as high as five times a wine bottle’s price. 
Paul Einbund, owner of two restaurants in the Bay Area, said “a lot of my diners just won’t drink domestic (wine).” But he does list some American wines alongside European wines at The Morris, his restaurant in San Francisco, and Sirene, his new restaurant in Oakland.
Not knowing what’s going to happen next is the worst part, Einblund said, especially for small businesses that depend on trying to buy their products at the lowest possible prices.
“People up and down the supply chain are in trouble,” he said. “We were getting emails saying pre-tariff pricing, but that’s dried up now. European producers are not selling to Americans right now. European buyers are not buying American wines right now.”
But Richard Samra, who has been growing grapes in the Sacramento Delta and Lodi for 40 years, said he is more worried about selling his grapes to domestic wineries. He said it’s “amazing” that some in the wine industry are asking for no tariffs on the competition.
He said that competition gets plenty of help. The European Commission recently approved $5.6 billion to support exports of French wines and spirits to the U.S. The European Union spends more than 1 billion euros a year to help boost European wine, and some countries have their own subsidy programs.  
“U.S. wine grape growers don’t have that,” Samra said.
“We want to level the playing field. We have plenty of grapes and wine available for sale,” Samra added. He said tens of thousands of acres of vines have been pulled out in California as supply outstrips demand, and he expects that to keep growing. He said imports are a major factor: “Profit margins for people are greater when they purchase a product from outside the U.S. and sell it here.”

Yet, vintners like Haas, in Paso Robles, said he also worries about the relationships that he has cultivated for years and how they’re being affected by the tariffs. Tablas, his winery, has lost all business in Canada this year.
“There’s certainly spillover effects in terms of other countries just being less wanting to support American products, because they feel like they’re being bullied,” Haas said. 
Tablas only exports about 5% of what it produces, but Haas wanted to grow that this year. “We did a lot of investment last year, and building up export markets,” he said. “And so to have it be down this year instead of up has certainly been a hit to us.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/073025-Tablas-Creek-Vineyard-LV-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-05 08:57:50.728878

Courtesy photo.In Minnesota and across the nation, hardworking families like mine are bracing for impact after our Republican members of Congress voted to cut spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion over the next decade.
As a result, 17 million Americans will have coverage ripped away from them, all for tax breaks whose biggest beneficiaries will be billionaires and big corporations. The latest estimate reported by the Minnesota Reformer shows at least 140,000 Minnesotans will lose coverage. The consequences of this bill will be felt for years to come, but some of its worst provisions will take effect in a matter of months.
Families like mine rely on Medicaid to keep our children, and our loved ones, healthy.
Our family receives Medicaid for our 11 year old daughter. She has a primary immune deficiency as well as a tethered spinal cord. Her medication costs over $75,000 a year, which we could not afford on our own or with my husband’s insurance.
Medicaid helps my daughter maintain her health so she does not end up critically ill with severe infections. It also prevents hospital visits and allows her to remain in school. Medicaid also helps cover the costs to monitor her tethered spinal cord and provide her with life-changing physical therapy. Without it, she could be at risk of losing her ability to be mobile.
Medicaid has changed her life.
Starting in 2026, families in Minnesota will feel the full force of the severe health care cuts.
First, premiums and out-of-pocket costs will skyrocket for people who purchase their own health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and many will lose coverage altogether due to miles of red tape.
Then, devastating cuts to Medicaid will begin to take effect. The savings are expected to come from pushing people off Medicaid through increasing eligibility verification. If we don’t vigilantly submit the correct paperwork, my daughter could lose her coverage.
At risk are hospitals whose patients are on Medicaid; seniors who need Medicaid for their nursing home care; and people fighting addiction or cancer.
Costs will skyrocket across the board: Minnesotans will be forced to travel further for maternity care and emergency rooms, face longer wait times due to hospital closures, and it will be harder for families to get covered and stay covered.
I fear for my daughter’s future — and for the millions of Minnesotans who rely on Medicaid to live. She did not ask for this. Nothing we did caused this. She was simply born with it. Both my husband and I are hard-working, tax-paying citizens that just happen to have a child with complex medical needs. For my daughter, this isn’t just about policy; it’s about survival. Without Medicaid, she loses access to the treatment that keeps her healthy, in school and full of life.
The damage will be felt in every corner of the country, including across Minnesota. In addition to people losing their health coverage, our local economy will suffer, with 18,000 jobs at risk in Minnesota due to these cuts.
Now that the bill is law, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans fully own the consequences. They jammed it through despite the fact that the American people overwhelmingly disapprove of these cuts.
When our premiums spike and out-of-pocket costs soar, families like mine will remember their vote. When we have nowhere to go for treatment, we’ll remember their vote. When our coverage is ripped away, we’ll remember their vote. When the obituaries pile up because people can no longer afford the care they need to stay alive, we’ll remember their vote.
Congressional Republicans must answer for the fallout.

Burlington, Vermont
Died July 31, 2025
Colchester, Vermont


Karen Boisvert Lapan passed away on July 31st, 2025 at the age of 65. She was surrounded by a dozen of her loved ones and had been visited by countless friends and family members over the last few weeks of her life.
Karen was born in Burlington, VT on July 7, 1960, to Marie and André Boisvert. She described herself as studious and quiet as a child, loving art and her dolls, and one of her earliest jobs as a young teen was teaching kids in her neighborhood how to read. She attended Burlington High School and pursued higher education at Johnson State College, CCV, and Burlington College, eventually earning an associate’s degree and a bachelor’s. With Richard Lapan she raised three children in Winooski and took on the role of mother to many more throughout her life. One of Karen’s greatest joys and sources of pride was her work at Burlington College. Through fourteen years of that work, she helped students from all walks of life find a path to fulfilling their dreams and gaining confidence in themselves. She was a tirelessly active member of her community elsewhere too, supporting her children and their peers as they participated in organizations like the Boy Scouts, the DREAM Mentoring Program, and the Winooski School District.


In her free time, Karen loved to read, cook, collect antiques, and watch documentaries. She was an avid historian and student of folkways and herbal medicine. A highlight of her last few years was her relationship with her grandson Bill, born in 2019. That year, Karen traveled out to the Pacific Northwest twice and got to spend cherished early days with baby Bill while visiting the Cascades, Portland, and sites along the rugged Oregon coast like Cannon Beach. Even as her health worsened, she made every effort to be present for Bill, celebrating three of his first five Christmases with him and enriching his life in ways he will appreciate for years to come.
If you knew Karen, you know how impossible it is to convey the generosity, patience, and compassion with which she treated everyone in her life. She had a capacity to see the good in people and to understand their shortcomings which, in turn, encouraged everyone around her to act more kindly towards each other. That reputation spread from Winooski and Burlington to corners all over Vermont and beyond, and it will live on in the memories we hold and the stories we tell about her.
She is survived by her children (Devon, Kaitlyn, Connor, and Kateland), the father of her children Richard, her brother Raymond and his wife Teresa, her mother Marie, her son-in-law Ross, and her grandson Bill. A special thanks to the staff of the McClure Miller Respite House, who took exceptional care of her in her final days. The celebration of Karen’s life was privately held.

That’s a reality for the roughly 1,200 people hoping to hunt the Monroe unit in Sevier and Piute counties, now scorched by the 61,500-acre Monroe Canyon Fire.

It’s the largest fire in Utah this year. As of Monday it was just 13% contained and, according to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, “the odds of us putting it out anytime soon are pretty low.” 
The U.S. Forest Service issued a closure order last week, in effect until at least Oct. 31 and impacting most of the Richfield Ranger District of the Fishlake National Forest — that also restricts access to roughly 60% of the Monroe hunting unit. 
Depending on fire behavior, the closure order could be rescinded before Oct. 31; however, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has several options for the roughly 1,200 hunters with general-season deer archery and muzzleloader, and limit-entry bull elk and black bear permits.

They can surrender their permit, get a refund, and allow the division to reinstate their bonus or preference points (the credit system that helps increase hunters’ chances of drawing big game permits over time). 
They could also extend their hunt into the 2026 season.
Or, they could opt to simply hunt the remaining, open sections of the Monroe unit. 
To qualify for the exemptions, hunters must contact the Division of Wildlife by at least the day before their hunt starts. 
The division also has separate guidelines for the Dedicated Hunter program, which allows people to do volunteer work to earn credit for hunting permits. If the fire persists past the qualifying hunts, the division may extend the refund options to other hunts, including certain bull elk and deer permits. 
For more information, visit the division’s website. 
The closure is restricting access to roughly 67% of the mule deer habitat in the area, as well as 72% of the elk habitat, according to the division. 
“We wanted to provide some relief options for hunters whose hunts would be severely impacted by the current wildlife and associated closures,” said Lindy Varney, licensing coordinator for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, in a statement. “While wildfires occur in Utah almost every summer and fall, this particular fire closed a significant portion of this hunting unit. And because the closure will be in effect past when the majority of the hunts are over, we wanted to offer some emergency options for hunters on this unit.”

(Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court’s request to the parties in a Louisiana redistricting case could affect Alabama’s similar, long-running battle over congressional boundaries. 
In an order issued Friday, the justices asked parties to address whether the state’s creation of a second majority-Black congressional district violated the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which provide for congressional representation and due process and forbid the denial of the vote based on race. 
Experts say the move could signal that the U.S. Supreme Court is looking to overturn Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which forbids election laws that discriminate based on race, color or membership in language minority groups.

A lower federal court in 2023 ordered Alabama to draw a second “opportunity” district for Black voters after ruling that Alabama’s racially polarized voting patterns — where white voters tend to support Republicans and Black voters tend to support Democrats — meant a map approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2021 did not give Black voters a chance to choose their preferred leaders. 
The court’s ruling in the case, known as Allen v. Milligan, leaned in large part on Section 2 of the law, and Jason Mazzone, a professor of law at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, wrote in a n email that the Supreme Court’s order for supplemental briefing was “a very big deal.”
“The case might result in the Court invalidating entirely Section 2 of the VRA on the basis that the Constitution is color blind and it bars race-conscious districting, including when mandated by Congress to remedy historical racial discrimination in voting,” Mazzone wrote. “Such a result would represent a massive change in election laws and practices with seismic consequences for democratic processes at every level of government.”
The Louisiana case, Louisiana v. Callais, stems from a map drawn by the state legislature that created a second majority-minority district to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The map was subsequently challenged as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander by a group of non-Black voters.
The Milligan plaintiffs sued Alabama shortly after the Legislature approved a new congressional map in 2021. A three-judge panel ruled for the plaintiffs in early 2022, but the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the lower court’s original ruling. The court upheld it in 2023, which led to a special session of the Alabama Legislature that July. Legislators approved a map that House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, signaled was an attempt to get the case back before the U.S. Supreme Court. The lower court rejected the map and the nation’s high court upheld that ruling on appeal. The court later had a special master draw a new congressional map for the state. 
Under the map, Alabama in 2024 elected two Black U.S. representatives to serve together for the first time in state history.
Following a trial earlier this year, the panel in May ruled that the Alabama Legislature intentionally discriminated against Black voters in approving the map in the July 2023 special session. The court is currently considering sanctions for the state, which could include requiring any future maps to win approval from the court, a process known as preclearance.
Deuel Ross, a lawyer with the Legal Defense Fund who represents plaintiffs in Alabama’s redistricting case, offered a more cautious view in an interview on Monday. Ross noted that the court had the U.S. Supreme Court had a chance to invalidate Section 2 of the VRA in the Milligan case two years ago, but chose not to.
“Just two years ago, a majority of the Supreme Court in Milligan expressly agreed that the Voting Rights Act is constitutional,” Ross said.
Ross said the Supreme Court’s request for briefs “doesn’t necessarily mean that the justices are looking to strike down the Voting Rights Act.”

Small clinics and hospitals are drowning in denied and delayed claims from Illinois Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs). To cope, some have stopped accepting Medicaid altogether. Meanwhile, MCOs see increasing profits, but aren’t meeting patient care metrics.

By Rachel Heimann Mercader, Illinois Answers Project
ILLINOIS – On a weekend night, long after her last patient had gone home, Crystal Stone sat at her desk at New Leaf Behavioral Health, sifting through a growing stack of unpaid Medicaid claims. The numbers didn’t add up. They never did. One denial after another — each one another threadbare explanation that left her clinic unpaid.
She should have been resting, spending time with her family, but instead, she was battling insurance companies for money she had already earned.
“It’s a torrential nightmare,” Stone said. “A dog and pony show.”
Stone, a psychiatric nurse practitioner and U.S. Air Force veteran, opened her psychiatric practice in 2023 and signed up to serve Medicaid patients — those often left behind in Illinois’ healthcare system. But she quickly learned that treating them wasn’t the hard part. Getting paid for that treatment was.

She says delays and denials from private Medicaid insurers have left her clinic financially strained and forced her to fight for payments she’s already earned. (provided by Crystal Stone)

Each week, she spends hours — sometimes entire weekends — writing emails, compiling evidence, and escalating complaints about delayed or denied reimbursements. She’s taken her concerns straight to the top, firing off messages to CEOs of Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) — the entities in charge of reimbursing providers for Medicaid claims — and even the director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS). The responses, when they come, often offer little relief. She’s been asked to work through her appointed representative and stop contacting higher-ups. She refuses.
Providers like Stone say Illinois’ Medicaid system is in crisis.
“This isn’t just oversight failure, it’s a betrayal of public trust,” she said.
The state relies on these private insurance companies to manage Medicaid payments, but when delays extend too long or denials become too frequent, small clinics and safety net hospitals end up in financial turmoil. Meanwhile, MCOs have seen significant increases in profits — one reported an increase of over $2 billion in the last two years. Yet, they are regularly failing to meet the metrics for quality of care established by the state.
Conservative estimates based on limited data from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services suggest that claims have been denied at rates as high as 17.5% over the years. That estimate does not include the average of 59% of appealed denials that are later overturned, but providers say overturned denials contribute to the delays in reimbursement that are causing them financial distress. Many are drowning in unpaid claims, forced to take on billing battles instead of patient care. Some simply stop accepting Medicaid altogether, leading to significant declines in the number of Medicaid providers in the state where nearly one in three residents rely on the program.
But change may be on the horizon.
The five MCOs currently overseeing Illinois’ Medicaid system were awarded state contracts in 2018.
The state will soon begin accepting proposals for new contracts, set to take effect Jan 1, 2027. For providers like Stone, the upcoming shake-up raises urgent questions: Will the next round of contracts fix the system’s failures? Or will the same issues persist, leaving providers — and their patients — fighting for care?
For now, Stone refuses to turn patients away. “We weren’t going to make them suffer,” she said. “I’m gonna fight.”
Denials and delays
Over the years, reimbursement delays and denials have made it nearly impossible for Debra Lowrance to continue caring for the state’s most vulnerable mothers. In 2018, she opened Labor of Love Midwifery and Women’s Health in Robinson, Illinois, offering prenatal, birth and postpartum care. As one of a handful of Certified Nurse Midwives (CNM) providing home births in Southern Illinois, Lowrance says she is in high demand, covering areas up to three-hours away by car, including Southern Indiana, to serve patients.
Each year, she is forced to take on fewer Medicaid patients to maintain financial stability. In 2019, Medicaid patients made up 21% of her practice. Last year, that number was just 8%.
“When we had some patients that were still straight Medicaid, I could get some reimbursement from them. Of course, the rate is awful, but at least it’s something,” Lowrance said. “But then when they started divvying up to the MCOs, that’s when I really started having trouble.”
That shift began in 2017, when former Gov. Bruce Rauner started to revamp Illinois’ use of Medicaid managed care when he chose to consolidate the system into seven MCOs.

She says the shift to managed care has made it harder to get reimbursed — even when services are clearly eligible for payment. (provided by Debra Lowrance)

Over the years, Lowrance has spent countless hours navigating denials and appeal processes, only to lose out on payment entirely.
“I ended up hiring an outside biller that helps me,” she said. “I’ll get handfuls of denials on the same patient over and over and over. And we’re checking things and we know we’re doing it right, but they just keep denying, denying and denying.”
Like Stone, she’s frustrated with the lack of transparency and accountability in the system.
In response to a public records request for data or reports showing MCO reimbursement delays between 2019 and 2024, The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) said it “doesn’t broadly track this data.” However, the agency does release quarterly reports on institutional hospital claims, which show that MCOs have denied and rejected claims at rates ranging from 8% to 17.5% since 2018.
The data does not count an initial denial or subsequent denials as a denial if that claim was eventually accepted and paid. Even when overturned, these initial denials can result in delayed reimbursements. Some hospitals and providers do count the initial denials they receive and they report much higher denial rates for their practices — some report  a 20% rate, and others a rate as high as 60%.
Under their current contracts with the state, MCOs are required to promptly reimburse providers who treat Medicaid patients. State rules mandate that MCOs pay 90% of uncontested claims within 30 days and 99% within 90 days.
Providers say the reasons given for denials are inaccurate or arbitrary, causing unnecessary delays. That concern is backed by data showing that, on average, 59% of formal grievances filed with MCOs in Illinois are overturned after being appealed by providers.

While these overturned denials mean providers get paid eventually, the appeal process is tedious and waiting for a decision means providers are waiting weeks to months for payments. Those wait times trickle down to patients in the form of less resourced care.
In some cases, providers who can’t bear the financial burden of delayed payments stop accepting Medicaid patients altogether.
The number of Illinois hospital-based providers accepting Medicaid patients has declined by approximately 27% in recent years — falling from 1,473 in 2018 to just 1,073 in 2024, according to data obtained by the Illinois Answers Project.

For the providers who remain, the financial strain of delayed and denied payments is becoming harder to bear.
In a federal lawsuit, Saint Anthony Hospital, a safety-net facility on Chicago’s West Side, alleged that chronic underpayments from MCOs nearly forced it to shut down in 2020. Court filings show the hospital’s available cash reserves fell from $20 million in 2015 — enough to operate for 72 days — to just $500,000 in 2019, barely covering two days of expenses. The lawsuit alleges that denials and delays by MCOs are the cause. The case was recently dismissed following a Court of Appeals decision. The hospital intends to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Saint Anthony remains committed to providing high quality medical care to all its patients. It also remains committed to support that care by vigorously pursuing its legal right to prompt and transparent payments,” wrote the hospital’s attorney Mike Shakman in an emailed statement.
The complaint states that MCOs often deny or delay claims without justification, sometimes for technical errors that are unrelated to the care provided. In one example, the hospital says an MCO denied a $92,000 claim because the patient’s name on a consent form was computer printed instead handwritten. Another denied a pediatric claim because a birth weight was not included, but the hospital argues the birth weight wasn’t relevant to the service.
In court, the hospital argued that because most MCOs are for-profit, they have built-in incentives to deny or delay reimbursements. The state pays MCOs a fixed amount per Medicaid patient, regardless of how much care that patient actually receives — so the less the MCO spends on care, the more it keeps.
The Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to spend at least 80% or 85% of premium dollars on medical care.
The hospital also points to the erosion of HFS oversight. Despite federal and state laws requiring states to monitor MCOs for timely and fair payments, the complaint says HFS has failed to publish timely performance reports, audit claim denials, or track whether MCOs are applying state-mandated Medicaid payment enhancements meant to support safety-net hospitals. Even when providers raise red flags — as Saint Anthony did in multiple meetings with the agency — HFS has repeatedly failed to take action, according to the lawsuit.
In an emailed statement, HFS said it encourages providers to seek to enforce their rights under their contracts. “HFS can utilize multiple enforcement mechanisms to hold the health plans accountable: corrective action plans, financial sanctions and placing a hold on the auto-assignment of members to a plan. The Department has and will continue to use these enforcement mechanisms when necessary,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote.
The state has acknowledged the ramifications of reimbursement delays.
In 2019, former Illinois Medicaid Director Doug Elwell warned CountyCare — the only government-owned, provider-led MCO in Illinois, operated by Cook County Health —  that providers were waiting up to nine months for payment. “We doubt all providers will make it,” he wrote in an email, urging the county or state to intervene before critical safety-net hospitals and nursing homes were forced to shut their doors.
Delays in provider payments can also stem not from the managed care organizations themselves, but from the state, according to Elwell. In a 2020 deposition, Elwell testified that when the state falls behind on its monthly payments to MCOs — a common occurrence — it can paralyze the system.
At another safety net hospital, Franciscan Health Olympia Fields, Chief Financial Officer Frank McHugh said that delayed and denied reimbursements from MCOs are a major strain on the hospital’s bottom line.

“In total, the denials we get are in the million dollar range,” McHugh said.
“We’ve had to add an additional physician advisor to help with denials,” McHugh said. “We have additional people in our business office and revenue cycle team. It puts a strain on our care management staff.”
McHugh said the financial pressure has prompted internal conversations about whether Franciscan should consider legal action similar to the lawsuit filed by Saint Anthony Hospital over Medicaid reimbursement practices.
For smaller practices like Stone’s New Leaf Behavioral Health, a couple of denied claims makes a huge difference. Last year, Stone contacted the state concerning 100 claims with denied or incorrect reimbursements at once.
“I have others who work for me,” she said. “It’s not just about ‘hey want my money…’  A lot of times I may not pay myself because I’m going to take care of them first.”

But reimbursement issues are just one piece of a larger problem. MCOs are supposed to coordinate care by ensuring access to primary care providers, arranging transportation, and incentivizing timely visits. When they fail to do so, McHugh said, patients often end up in the emergency room instead — shifting the cost of care onto providers that are already financially vulnerable.
Rising profits, declining performance
Medicaid payments haven’t always been so hard to get. Prior to 2018, Saint Anthony Hospital said they received more consistent and adequate payments directly from the state — a model they say offered greater financial stability.
The managed care model, which originated in the 1960s and 70s, is designed to control costs and incentivize efficient care — but it also means that if the cost of services exceeds the payment, the MCO absorbs the loss.
During Gov. Rauner’s administration, in August 2017, Health and Family Services awarded new contracts to seven MCOs, expanding managed care coverage from 30 counties to all 102 across the state. Valued at $63 billion, the contracts marked the launch of HealthChoice Illinois — the largest procurement in the state’s history.
Since then, spending on managed care has skyrocketed. In fiscal year 2010, HFS spent just $251 million on MCOs. By 2023, that number had ballooned to nearly $22 billion and Illinois ranked sixth in the country for MCO-related spending. Today roughly four out of every five Medicaid enrollees are covered by an MCO.

Despite this dramatic increase in investment, providers and patients say they’re not seeing the benefits. Some argue that the sheer volume of spending has done little to improve care access or streamline reimbursement, and instead has created a system where insurers profit by withholding payment. For patients, the promised efficiencies of managed care — better coordination, more timely services, and broader provider networks — often fall flat. The disconnect between rising investment in MCOs and worsening outcomes for patients and providers has fueled calls for stronger oversight and reform.
An Illinois Answers analysis examined several years of financial statements filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance.
Both revenues and expenses have increased by roughly a billion dollars between 2020 and 2024. Records show that while there is some high variability in annual profits in the last few years, Illinois MCOs are typically profiting hundreds of millions a year.

In 2023, excluding CountyCare — the state’s only government-run MCO — reported profits ranged from $60 million for Humana to $130 million for Meridian Health Plan of Illinois.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois — part of the larger Blue Cross Blue Shield network — reported $1.4 billion in net income that year, though that figure includes results from four other states and isn’t directly comparable.

Explainer: Variability in MCO profits in recent years.
The pandemic temporarily boosted profits for many insurance companies, including MCOs, because people delayed or skipped medical care while plans continued receiving full premium payments from the state. The end of pandemic-era policies, including continuous coverage requirements in 2023, reduced enrollment and tightened margins across the industry.
Internal financial structures — such as large management fees and capital transfers — can also affect how profits appear on paper. For example, in 2024, Meridian posted a $70.9 million loss — yet paid $410 million in management fees as well as returned $200 million to its parent Centene. These internal transfers allow parent companies to profit but can make their health plans appear to lose money.

Corporate profits for some MCO parent companies have also increased in recent years, in part driven by billions in taxpayer-funded premiums. Centene Corporation, which owns Meridian Health Plan of Illinois, reported $1.2 billion in overall corporate profits in 2022, rising to $3.3 billion by 2024.

The state’s Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) reports offer a partial window into MCO finances by showing how much of each premium dollar from the state is spent on patient care — and how much is left over.
According to these state reports, Illinois Medicaid insurers have been keeping more money than ever before. In 2022, major players like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois  and Meridian Health Plan of Illinois retained three to eight times more than they did in 2018.
Overall, the number of Medicaid patients enrolled in Illinois MCOs increased by roughly 26% between 2018 and 2022.

While these corporations are seeing financial gains, they are falling short on key performance metrics set by the state for quality patient care. HFS publishes quarterly reports tracking MCO performance, including the timeliness of health assessments.
Between the first quarter of 2020 and the last quarter of 2023, only one of Illinois’s five main MCOs met the target for completing health risk assessments or screenings for at least 70% of new enrollees within 60 days. That exception was Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, which hit the benchmark only once — in the third quarter of 2022.
For the rest of the reporting period, all five Illinois MCOs — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, Meridian Health Plan of Illinois, Aetna Better Health of Illinois, Molina Healthcare of Illinois and Humana — consistently fell short, often by 20 to 30 percentage points or more.
This pattern extends to another critical metric focused on high-risk enrollees. Despite state requirements that 60% of high-risk enrollees receive an individualized care plan within 90 days, most MCOs in Illinois consistently fell short of this benchmark. The data shows that, quarter after quarter, four out of five plans failed to meet the threshold — leaving some of the state’s most vulnerable patients without timely, coordinated care.
Only Aetna Better Health of Illinois consistently met the state’s 60% threshold, while other insurers — including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and Meridian Health Plan of Illinois — remained well below the threshold, with some rates dipping as low as 13%.
Aetna Better Health of Illinois, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and Meridian Health Plan of Illinois did not respond to requests for comment.
“We are actively working to streamline our reimbursement processes and improve key performance measures while continuing to build a Medicaid program that providers trust and members rely on,” Alexandra Normington, chief communications officer for CountyCare told the Illinois Answers Project.
In an emailed statement, HFS said its staff discusses permanence metrics with MCOs during their quarterly business reviews. “HFS’ Bureau of Managed Care is in the process of updating the metrics used for these reports, including care coordination, and moving away using MCO-reported data, where possible, to improve data integrity,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote.
Patients can’t find care 
Medicaid enrollment in Illinois grew from about 2.9 million in 2019 to nearly 3.9 million in 2023, partially due to pandemic-era policies that paused eligibility checks and allowed people to remain enrolled regardless of changes in income or status.
In 2024, both enrollment and provider participation fell. Enrollment declined by about 660,000 people at the same time as redeterminations after the pandemic-era coverage rules ended, and the number of participating providers dropped by nearly 60,000 — a 19% decrease, wiping out several years of growth.
Providers say the decline may be tied to low reimbursement rates, administrative burdens, and growing frustrations with managed care organizations.
For patients the decline in providers can mean long waits for care or traveling long distances to find a provider.
When Finn Bradley went on Medicaid in 2022, they had to give up their therapist. The 29-year-old Chicagoan, who identifies as queer, had been seeing someone they trusted — a provider who understood their background and needs. But switching to a Medicaid plan meant starting over in a system that was already hard to navigate.
They chose Aetna Better Health, a managed care organization (MCO), but finding a new therapist, one who accepted Medicaid, took months. The therapist they had at the time, understanding the delay ahead, offered discounted intermediary sessions. But there was still a gap in care and it came at a cost to both Bradley’s mental and financial health.
“Having support in that way is pretty important for me, and not having it — I can feel a little bit lost and have a harder time,” Bradley said.
Bradley isn’t the only one.
A December 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that the country lacks enough behavioral health providers who accept Medicaid to meet current demand.
In 2021, fewer than half of those with a mental illness received timely care, according to the report. The Inspector General urged states to boost provider participation by easing administrative burdens and reassessing reimbursement rates for behavioral health services.
For many Medicaid patients, delays in care as they search for a provider aren’t just inconvenient — they’re dangerous, said Nadeen Israel, Senior Vice President of Policy and Advocacy at AIDS Foundation Chicago.
Cornelia (Cye-Cye) Simms, 59, lives on Chicago’s South Side and said it can take her up to an hour and a half by CTA to reach a Medicaid mental health provider — most of which are concentrated on the North Side. When she recently needed heart testing, she couldn’t find a provider who accepted her coverage and ended up paying out of pocket at Northwestern Medicine.
“I was weighing whether I should eat or [make a monthly payment],” she said.
The financial stress is compounded by the mental toll.
“For folks who already qualify for the Medicaid program, you have to be in or near poverty,” said Israel. “You’re low income, so you’re already dealing with a lot just to survive, just kind of day to day — whether it’s rent, housing, food, family, child care, school, your job. [Not having mental health care] adds another… unsustainable barrier to accessing basic care.”
Bradley said the emotional toll of having to start from scratch in finding someone who truly understood them was particularly impactful.
“When therapy is a specialized care and you’re looking for somebody who understands you in various ways, the relationship between the therapist and the client is really important. So you want to trust them and not just find the first person who accepts your insurance,” they said. “Unfortunately, that is what a lot of people on Medicaid feel like they have to do.”
Attempts at accountability
As delays and denials mount, the system designed to hold MCOs accountable has been slow to act.
In 2021, the Illinois General Assembly established the Medicaid Managed Care Oversight Commission to monitor and evaluate the program’s effectiveness. The governor-appointed commission was supposed to start submitting findings and recommendations to the General Assembly in January 2022 on a quarterly basis. The commission did not meet for the first time until 2024.
“Really nothing has occurred,” said commission member Gerald DeLoss, CEO of Illinois Association for Behavioral Health.
HFS, which assists in staffing the commission, did not directly address questions about why the commission did not meet until 2024, but said “it is the commission’s co-chairs who are empowered to set the timing of meetings.” Emails obtained by Illinois Answers show that HFS staff set up the meetings that were held in 2024.
“HFS values the commission’s input about how to continue to improve Illinois Medicaid managed care,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email.
His organization represents community-based mental health and substance abuse providers who serve Medicaid patients, and communicates with MCOs and advocates for compliance with state regulations. But progress towards addressing the issue of reimbursement denials, he said, has been limited.
“It’s almost humorous, in an ironic way,” he said. “That we have a field [mental health care] that is underpaid, underfunded, that looks to trade associations like ours and others to help them to understand the laws and comply with the law.”
“And then you have a managed care field that is extremely well funded, extremely well organized – [a] number of lawyers, [a] number of regulatory people and policy analysts – and they can’t keep up to date on the laws in our state.”
Senator Dave Syverson, who is also a member of the commission, acknowledged that he is also hearing about how denials and delays are impacting providers and hospitals.
“When there’s no logical reason, and the carrier has to go back and appeal it and submit more data, it just takes a lot of extra time and work, which delays getting the payment to the provider,” he said. He added that he hopes changes in the new MCO contracts will help the situation.
While providers wait to see if things will change with the new contracts, Paris Ervin, spokesperson for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA), says hospitals have poured significant resources into managing what she described as “intentionally obtuse and inconsistent” prior authorization processes, which she says are another way MCOs delay or deny care.
Prior authorization is a process where insurers require providers to obtain approval before delivering certain treatments or services, which can result in delays or outright denials — even when care is medically necessary. These processes, she said, are often designed to boost profits “at a significant cost to patient care.”
In response, IHA partnered with the Illinois General Assembly and Governor Pritzker’s administration to pass legislative reforms aimed at easing the burden of prior approval. The legislation, which was signed into law in July 2024, established new guidelines for prior authorization, including a “gold card” program to streamline approvals for providers with strong track records.
IHA has worked with the HFS and the MCOs to develop administrative rules for implementing these reforms, and a draft of those rules is expected soon.
Still, Ervin said that prior authorization denials and delays remain among the top challenges to providing care to Medicaid patients. “Inappropriate denials negatively impact health care for Medicaid patients,” she said. “Every dollar that is spent on navigating these inconsistent and unfair MCO processes is a dollar that is not available  for patient care or community services.”
Looking ahead, IHA has submitted formal recommendations for the state’s next round of MCO contracts. IHA’s proposals include calls for higher reimbursement rates, reduced administrative burdens, better care coordination and stronger requirements for mental health and substance use disorder parity.
HFS told Illinois Answers that starting in early 2024, in preparation for new contracts, the agency sought input from customers, providers and advocates about how MCOs can better serve Medicaid customers and improve quality.
The state’s new Medicaid managed care contracts are expected to be finalized in 2027 — offering what many hope will be a turning point. But until then, providers and patients remain stuck in a system marked by uncertainty, financial strain, and limited accountability.
“As sure as the day is long, I am going to aggressively go after [payment] because I rendered services,” Stone said. “I want to be paid for the work that I do, because it’s not just about me. I have people who work for me, who need their paychecks because they need to take care of their family and their kids and they need to be paid.”

There is no clear frontrunner and at least one more potential candidate lurking.","Kamala Harris’ penchant for strings of abstruse verbiage — popularly known as word salads — was one of several reasons her presidential campaign failed last year.
Her tendency was on display again last week when she announced she would not run for California governor after making other candidates, political media and voters wait for months for her decision. Harris bowed out of the 2026 race in a written statement, saying, “I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.
“As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking — committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook,” she added.
A day later, Harris continued her parade of vague statements during a softball interview with late night talk show host Steven Colbert, declaring that the American system of government was broken. Pressed mildly to explain, Harris responded, “Well, but it’s also evident, isn’t it? But it doesn’t mean we give up.”
Whatever persuaded Harris not to seek the governorship, her announcement finally allows those who want the job to shift into a higher gear. Had she run, several of the hopefuls would probably have dropped out. 
With her out of the picture, the field remains crowded without a clear frontrunner.
“None of these candidates start out with statewide name recognition,” Garry South, a veteran Democratic strategist, told the Los Angeles Times.
That said, there does appear to be two fairly distinct levels of candidacy: Democrats with genuine shots at winning versus those who face an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.
At the moment, the higher tier includes Katie Porter, a former Orange County congresswoman who fell short in a U.S. Senate bid last year; Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, who has substantial private wealth and is backed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; and Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles.
The lower tier includes Xavier Becerra, a former state attorney general and Biden cabinet member; Toni Atkins, the former president pro tem of the state Senate; state schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond and former state Controller Betty Yee.
What about Republicans?
Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton are running, but the chances of a GOP win next year are infinitesimal. However, were the Democratic field to remain large, fragmenting the Democratic vote, a Republican could finish second in the primary and win a spot on the general election ballot, essentially guaranteeing the Democratic nominee an easy win.
That’s what happened last year when Democrat Adam Schiff indirectly helped Republican Steve Garvey place second in the U.S. Senate primary, thereby foregoing a general election duel with Porter.
When a clear Democratic frontrunner emerges in next year’s campaign for governor, the other Democrats will be competing for second place in the primary and a spot on the November ballot.
Meanwhile, another potential candidate could change the post-Harris dynamics: Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso, a Republican-turned-Democrat who lost the mayor’s race in 2022 and is reportedly weighing either another mayoralty bid next year, challenging incumbent Karen Bass, or a shot at the governorship.
Caruso is very wealthy and could draw heavy support from California’s business community, particularly if he were to survive the primary and face a liberal Democrat such as Porter.
We waited for months to learn whether Harris would run. Now we’re waiting for Caruso.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/071524-Kamala-Harris-LMO-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-05 08:57:50.728878

“I think protecting history speaks well of where we’ve been not only as a state but as a nation. And certainly it’s important for us to protect history,” Allen said in a phone interview Monday.

The 2017 law forbids local governments from relocating, altering, renaming or disturbing monuments or architecturally significant buildings that are at least 40 years old. The law allows governments to apply for waivers to alter monuments and notable buildings between 20 and 40 years old.
Critics said the law makes it difficult for Alabama communities to remove monuments to the Confederacy, many of which were erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as markers of white supremacy.
As of April, Alabama still has about 175 Confederate monuments around the state, while 18 have been removed or renamed since 2018, according to The Southern Poverty Law Center. Twelve of the removals and renamings happened in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd.
Birmingham was fined $25,000 for surrounding a Confederate Soldiers & Sailors monument in Linn Park with plywood in 2017, a case that went to the Alabama Supreme Court, which upheld the law in 2019. The following year, the monument was removed during the George Floyd protests. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin indicated at the time the city would be willing to pay the fine, citing ongoing unrest as more expensive.
Allen has attempted to increase the penalties many times over the years, to no avail. In 2020, he tried to increase the fine to $10,000 per day and in 2024, Allen filed for an increase to $5,000 per day.
This time he believes legislators will pass the bill because the timing is right.
“It’s just a process. And sometimes, an important piece of legislation just gets left on the table. And I don’t think it’s any reason other than a time issue,” he said.
Sonny Brasfield, executive director of the Association of County Commission of Alabama, said passing the bill likely isn’t at the front of legislators’ minds so it’s hard to say if rural counties will have any major hardship with the newly proposed fines.
“In some ways it’s difficult to talk about that because I don’t think the issue of renaming facilities or buildings is at the forefront of Alabama,” he said.
Brasfield said removal of the memorials isn’t a concern in the state anymore and doesn’t think there’s a reason for the fine increase.
“I don’t think this is a problem. And so I really don’t see a reason for the fine to be increased because normally you increase fines if you’re trying to deter repeated behavior,” he said.

For years, U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans has told the story about how his grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico “the right way … the legal way.” The Fort Lupton Republican, who represents Colorado’s 8th Congressional District in Congress, leveraged the story to boost his credibility as he endorsed President Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportations. He contrasted his own family’s purported “right” immigration story with the “wrong” one of millions of U.S. residents to argue they deserve to be deported.
“You need to go stand in that line and do it the right way, do it the legal way, so you are not leapfrogging over those folks like my grandfather, who did it the right way and did it the legal way,” he said in January.
But as Chase Woodruff, Newsline’s senior reporter, discovered through a search of public documents, Evans’ grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, entered the U.S. with his family without authorization and lived unlawfully for many years in El Paso. He was once arrested for an immigration violation and faced deportation proceedings.
Woodruff’s investigation was news because Evans had made the false story about his grandfather, who died in 2014, central to his support for a cruel federal policy that is causing immense harm to families and communities across the country. But the real falsehood was not that Chavez had actually immigrated the wrong way. It was that it was ever so easy to define what the wrong way even is.
Immigrating to America is very hard to do. Even immigrants who follow strictly legal paths to U.S. residency face a monster bureaucracy of restrictions and complexity, and even those legal paths are part of a system that American lawmakers of all stripes admit has been broken for decades.
For too many migrants, the journey is more than hard — it’s fatal. The U.S. southern border is among the deadliest land migration routes in the world. Last year almost 1,300 migrants in the Americas died or went missing, most of them at the U.S.-Mexico border. A stretch of the border along New Mexico and west Texas is especially deadly for migrants, according to a joint investigation by Source New Mexico and The Texas Tribune. From January 2023 to August 2024, 299 human remains were reported in the region, known as the El Paso sector.
But many people decide that the journey is worth risking, because conditions in their home country are too difficult or impossible. They might be motivated by economic destitution, political violence, crime or a natural disaster, against which points of administrative rectitude can appear petty or misplaced. The way that a representative in the U.S. House labels “wrong” could be the only way an immigrant has found to keep loved ones alive. Sometimes the choice is not between right and wrong but between wrong and death, which is hardly a choice.
Chavez was 5 years old when his mother took him and five siblings across the border to El Paso in December 1929. Chavez’s father had died only two months earlier, records obtained by Woodruff show. The family settled in El Segundo Barrio, an El Paso district that one resident, Chicano poet Lalo Delgado, described as a “square mile of poverty and misery.” But despite difficulties the Chavezes immigrated based on the same factors immigrants must weigh today.
“My family fought tooth and nail for the American dream so that future generations like me could have a better life,” Evans himself has said.
Cuauhtemoc Chavez went on to serve honorably in World War II and earned U.S. citizenship in 1946. He was later president of a union representing civil service workers at Fort Bliss in Texas. America is better off for his presence in the country.
After Newsline published Woodruff’s investigation last week, Evans — who declined to speak with Newsline about the story — seemed to acknowledge that rigid moral categories resist application to human beings struggling to survive and thrive.
“I think I’ve always talked about doing it the ‘right way,’ which is in reference to the fact that (my grandfather) joined the military and served his country,” Evans said when questioned by a CPR reporter about Woodruff’s findings.
In other words, what immigrants contribute to their adopted country can outweigh the infractions of their arrival, and the totality of their experience can overcome particular episodes of blame. The Trump administration’s immigration policy would be a lot more humane, and it would better serve America, if it operated under the wisdom of this insight.

It may win yet.,"Jersey City has spent years trying to hide its internal investigation of a cop accused of firing his gun at civilians. It may win yet.  (Photo by Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)Jersey City found a sneaky way out of its obligation to inform citizens about how it handles a bad cop among its ranks: delay until the circumstances are better.
The New Jersey Supreme Court on Monday issued a decision in a yearslong dispute between the New Jersey Monitor and Jersey City over the internal affairs report concerning a police lieutenant arrested in 2019 after authorities say he drank as many as eight beers, got into a fight with his daughter’s boyfriend, and fired a gun at people gathered outside his home.
The unanimous ruling didn’t quite go Jersey City’s way — it says the city can’t cite the lieutenant’s subsequent expungement of his criminal record as a way to shield documents about his departmental discipline. But it also didn’t go quite our way either, since the court said the state’s expungement statute requires that references to the cop’s criminal case must be redacted from the report. Will there be anything left after the portions related to the behavior that led to Timmins’ arrest are erased? Who knows? No outside party has seen the 11-page report in question. The trial court judge who ruled against us was offered a chance to review it but declined.
If the internal affairs report ends up getting produced and all of its useful information is hidden behind black magic marker, kudos to the city’s legal team for orchestrating a delay that may end up allowing them to keep it under wraps.
Here’s what happened: When we at the New Jersey Monitor first heard the details of the episode that won Lt. Michael Timmins a 90-day suspension from the Jersey City police force, we filed a records request with Jersey City to get the internal affairs report about the matter. To my mind, getting drunk and firing your gun at citizens should be cause for termination, not a 90-day unpaid vacation, so we wanted to find out how the city settled on that particular punishment.
On March 18, 2022, we filed a request for it, and the city did not issue its ultimate denial until May 10 — about 45 days after the state-mandated deadline for a response. We sued in June to get the report.
The city initially told us that we couldn’t get the report because the municipal interest in keeping it private outweighed the public’s interest in it. Then a funny thing happened. Timmins’ record was expunged in August 2022 after he pleaded guilty to a lesser offense and entered into a program meant for first-time offenders. The city’s legal argument then shifted to saying it would be illegal for it to hand over the internal affairs report because it would be violating the state’s expungement statute, which bars the release of records related to Timmins’ arrest and guilty plea.
The Supreme Court did not agree with this argument — but they did agree that the expungement statute requires that Timmins’ internal affairs report on his arrest be redacted of all mentions of it.
In a universe where Jersey City responded to our request for the report in the timeframe the law requires, we’d already have it. Instead, it may end up behind lock and key forever. And now Jersey City has given other towns a playbook to keep similar reports from ever seeing the light of day. 
Our attorney in this matter, CJ Griffin, shares that concern.
“There was no doubt this IA report had to be disclosed under the law, but we had to sue for it and then the officer was able to get an expungement during the proceedings. Other towns will no doubt try the same thing,” Griffin said.

Hunting using bait is already illegal for hunting bears, deer, moose and other wildlife, and it's time that prohibition extends to other hunted species.

The Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department — and the scientific community at large — recognizes the tremendous value of bobcats, coyotes, foxes and other wild animals labeled “furbearer” predator species on our landscapes. 
Ironically, Fish & Wildlife’s hunting and trapping policies do not reflect that. 
Instead, their policies feed into a culture of loathing toward predator species, as some hunters and trappers view them as competition over prey species, like deer, turkeys and rabbits, that they want all to themselves to hunt.

Furbearer species are often hunted at night with the aid of thermal scopes, high-tech game calling devices, hunting hounds and bait piles, even on private land and our shared public lands. There are few regulations to protect these animals from unethical and dangerous forms of killing. We must rely on the Legislature to address this, since Fish & Wildlife seems content to keep hunters and trappers happy.
There is a bill, H.132, that would prohibit the hunting of furbearer species using bait. Hunting using bait is already illegal for hunting bears, deer, moose and other wildlife, and it’s time that prohibition extends to other hunted species. Not only does baiting violate the fair chase ethics of hunting, but it also spreads disease, sickens our pets who feed off the bait and habituates wildlife to human landscapes, causing conflicts with people.
Fish & Wildlife asks the public not to feed wildlife, but meanwhile it is legal to feed/bait wildlife for the purpose of hunting. This seems very contradictory. 
There are numerous studies that warn of the dangers of baiting wildlife. One review of multiple studies states, “Large concentrations of wildlife activity centered around feeding or baiting sites have been widely implicated as a major mechanism influencing inter- and intra-specific transmission of infectious diseases.”
Hunting over bait piles has also resulted in at least three dogs, over the past few years, who were mistaken for coyotes and shot and killed by predator hunters in Vermont. There’s likely more tragedies that we don’t know about. 
Allowing this form of hunting encourages bad actors and signals to the public that these wild animals don’t matter — but they do. 
Foxes and coyotes are top predators of white-footed mice, which are the primary hosts for the bacteria that causes lyme disease. Many people resort to using toxic rodenticides to address rodent problems when we should be relying on foxes, bobcats, coyotes and other furbearer species to manage rodent populations.
Herbivorous mammals like groundhogs might otherwise overpopulate without the presence of furbearer species. In addition, unlike prey species like deer, furbearer species like bobcats and coyotes do not overpopulate. 
There really is not one good reason to hunt them at all. To hunt them over bait piles is simply an abomination. Please support H.132.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Randolph County Courthouse was once saved by seven elderly women wearing nothing but porcelain replicas of the building they were trying to protect. In Rome, Indiana — which long ago lost its status as Perry County’s seat — the original, early 19th-century courthouse still stands proudly near the Ohio River. And in Cass County, a local artist unknowingly contributed a decades-old painting to a now-complete, and eclectic, collection celebrating Indiana’s county courthouses.
They’re just a few of the stories brought to life in a new temporary exhibit highlighting the state’s historic county courthouses, which opened Friday at Indiana Landmarks’ Rapp Family Gallery in Indianapolis.

The exhibit features 92 original artworks — one from each of Indiana’s counties — and represents the culmination of an 18-year project led by Noblesville attorney Doug Church.
“The paintings are all sizes, they’re all different kinds of approaches to the art,” Church said during a talk at the gallery Friday evening. “There are oils, pastels, pen and ink, there’s a woodcut. It’s really remarkable. … It is eclectic to the max.”
The exhibit is the result of a long-running collaboration between Indiana Landmarks, the Indiana State Bar Association and the Indiana Bar Foundation, with contributions from judges, lawyers, historians, artists and community members across the state. 
Since 2007, Church has worked to collect an original artwork for each of Indiana’s county courthouses — some current, some historic, and some “a little of both.”
Church praised the buildings themselves as “secular cathedrals” that symbolize the rule of law and anchor communities across the state. 
With no artistic restrictions on medium or style, the collection now includes everything from juried contest winners to historic pieces long stored in basements or donated by local groups
“Doug’s courthouse project isn’t just about creating beautiful artwork, though the 92 pieces are truly stunning,” said Michael Jasaitis, president of the Indiana State Bar Association. “This project represents something far more profound. It’s about understanding that courthouses are the beating heart of our communities, the physical manifestation of our commitment to the rule of law.”
A statewide search
As Church recounted, the project began when he convinced his own Hamilton County Bar Association to commission a painting for his 2007 installation as president of the state bar. That painting, of the courthouse just across the street from his law office in downtown Noblesville, became the first in the collection.
Eighteen years and thousands of miles later, Church has amassed 91 handcrafted images — plus one woodcut — each representing a different courthouse. Nearly all are tied to a unique story, the lawyer said.
The painting of the Cass County Courthouse, for example, was completed by late artist Helen Irene Miller Murphy, who left behind hundreds of works now housed with the Logansport Art Association. Church had nearly given up on Cass County when the association reached out with an offer.

“They said, ‘We found a courthouse, and we’re willing to sell,’” he recalled. “Reluctantly, I responded. … I said, ‘I really appreciate that, but we want a loan.’ There was nothing for a while. And then I got a call, they said, ‘We’ve changed our minds. We’ll donate it.’”
The Cass County piece, obtained earlier this year, was the final one needed to complete the statewide collection.
The painting by Murphy, who passed away in 2015 at 103 years of age, is not dated but was likely completed in the late 1950s, Church said.
Another standout is the courthouse painting for Tippecanoe County, where the local bar association raised funds for a juried art contest and commissioned seven different artworks, including one of the county courthouse. The opening reception in Lafayette ultimately drew 40 submissions and hundreds of attendees.

In Randolph County, residents famously rallied against plans to raze their courthouse in the early 2000s.
The resistance included “seven women ranging in age from 77 to 94,” recalled Clay Miller, former president of the Indiana State Bar Association and a past Indiana Landmarks board member.
“They were all part of the bridge club … wearing only their birthday suits, strategically concealed by porcelain models of the original witness,” Miller said during the Friday presentation. 
Their protest, featured in the documentary “Courthouse Girls of Farmland,” helped save the structure that’s now topped once more with its iconic clock tower.
Symbols of law and community
But the courthouse buildings themselves are more than civic architecture, said historian Elizabeth Osborn.

“They are the brick and mortar representation or symbol of the civic ideals and aspirations of the people who commissioned them, paid for them, and saw them as important parts of their community,” said Osborn, director of education at Indiana University’s Center on Representative Government.
She described Indiana’s courthouses as “head and shoulders” above their neighbors — literally. Often the tallest and grandest buildings in their towns, they serve as physical symbols of justice, order and community pride.
Even today, Osborn noted, when courthouse interiors might be guarded by metal detectors, or even when courts move to other locations, the buildings still function as local hubs — housing not just courtrooms, but government offices, public records and community events.
“You paid your taxes there, you registered to vote, you maybe served on a jury,” she said. “Courthouses were the center of the community.”
“And now,” Osborn continued, “courthouses are being preserved, even after they fall out of use for their intended purposes.”
From basements to the gallery
Many of the pieces in the exhibit were collected or discovered via chance encounters, archival hunts or personal connections, Church said. 
One painting, of the historic Madison County Courthouse, sat in storage at the Anderson Library for years before Church arranged its donation. His father had originally gifted the piece in honor of Church’s late mother, a trustee of the library.
Some courthouses were painted by professionals, others by hobbyists. Some depict newly built justice centers, like those in Marion or Floyd counties, while others capture long-lost historic courthouses — like Delaware County’s original building, replaced in the 1960s.

In Steuben County, Church accepted a courthouse painting by an unknown artist after a judge discovered it in the basement. 
“The judge was so excited to give me this painting,” Church said. “Then he said, ‘Come on up,’ and took me to the top of the courthouse tower. It was one of those special moments.”
The exhibit will remain on view at Indiana Landmarks Center for the foreseeable future, though Church and the bar association hope it eventually finds a permanent public home.
The “ultimate objective” is for the artwork to be displayed “in a public place,” like a state judicial building … when the state of Indiana finally decides to build one.”
“Our fingers are crossed,” Church said. “We want them all to be displayed, where everyone can see them.”
The collection’s mission, he added, is not just about art, but about honoring the legacy and continued relevance of Indiana’s county courthouses.
“These are the biggest buildings. The most significant architecture,” Church said. “They’re secular cathedrals. And we’re lucky.”

No nation on earth produces more plastic waste than the U.S., according to a 2022 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. (Photo courtesy of Oregon State University)The $8 trillion wholesale product distribution industry is challenging a four-year-old Oregon recycling law weeks after the law took effect.
The Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act, passed by the state Legislature in 2021, was meant to create statewide standards for what can and cannot be recycled and established new packaging fees for companies that sell products in Oregon. The fees, based on the weight and recyclability of the material, are meant to require product manufacturers and distributors to cover some of the end-of-life costs for disposing of their packaging — costs that are currently borne by the businesses and Oregonians who have to pay for the garbage.
Products with less packaging and with reusable packaging carry lower fees than goods packaged in bulky plastics and single-use materials, ideally encouraging producers to choose lighter, more sustainable materials. It follows regulations in Oregon in recent years that require manufacturers to pick up some of the end-of-life costs of paint, mattresses and electronics, or to invest in programs to recycle such products.
But on July 30, about three weeks after the law was implemented and manufacturers received their first bills, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors sued the state in U.S. District Court in Portland to stop it from continuing, claiming the law is unconstitutional. The association is a trade group representing what it says is the $8.2 trillion wholesale distribution industry.
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, Environmental Quality Commission and State Attorney General Dan Rayfield are named as defendants in the suit.
In emails, spokespersons for Rayfield and the Environmental Quality Department said they cannot comment on pending litigation.
 Shifting the burden

The wholesale distributors claim the law is unconstitutional because, as it’s structured, it gives regulatory authority over the fee schedule and collection not to the state’s environmental quality department but to a private entity — the Circular Action Alliance, or CAA — a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C.
Twenty multinational corporations in the food, beverage, retail and consumer goods industries, including Amazon, CocaCola and Nestle, formed the alliance in 2022. It oversees similar recycling fee programs that are rolling out as a result of new policies in California, Colorado, Maine and Maryland.
In Oregon, the alliance is in charge of setting and collecting fees for 60 different material categories based on weight and recyclability. Along with local governments, the alliance participates in choosing where to invest the revenue from those fees, which must be projects that improve Oregon’s recycling infrastructure.
Eric Hoplin, the wholesaler association president and CEO, said in a statement on the group’s website that Oregon’s law is unfair because it shifts undue burden for disposal costs to distributors who don’t get to make packaging choices.
On June 4, officials from the group asked the state’s environmental quality department to delay enacting the law for another year, despite more than a year of public comment and rulemaking the department undertook before fully launching and enforcing the regulations.
“Rather than encourage sustainability through a uniform and transparent system where compliance burdens are shared across industries, Oregon chose to shift the burden to the parts of the supply chain that have little to no control over decisions to design, reduce, reuse or recycle a product,” Hoplin said.
In their suit, the group’s lawyers claim that Oregon’s law discriminates against out-of-state producers and violates state and federal due process laws. The lawyers claim the fee-setting methodology used by the Circular Action Alliance has not been publicly disclosed, debated or subject to rule-making and that companies forced to pay it were not given the chance to challenge it or resolve disputes.
“For many, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses operating on thin margins, the fees were unexpected and unexpectedly high,” they wrote in their filing.
The law exempts producers who earn $5 million or less in gross revenue.
State Sen. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro, who co-sponsored the recycling modernization law back in 2021, said in a statement that the law is supposed to bring more fairness to Oregonians who have been on the hook for disposal costs of product packaging for years.
“If a producer creates more packaging waste, a producer will pay more for the disposal of the waste, not Oregonians,” Sollman said. “Oregon’s residential customers and small businesses are bearing the greatest burden of the rising cost of waste.”
Sollman said the “multi-trillion-dollar industry” is “fighting for profit, not for Oregonians. The lawsuit they filed Wednesday threatens our progress toward a cleaner, more sustainable Oregon.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)People are now routinely using chatbots to write computer code, summarize articles and books, or solicit advice. But these chatbots are also employed to quickly generate text from scratch, with some users passing off the words as their own.

This has, not surprisingly, created headaches for teachers tasked with evaluating their students’ written work. It’s also created issues for people seeking advice on forums like Reddit, or consulting product reviews before making a purchase.
Over the past few years, researchers have been exploring whether it’s even possible to distinguish human writing from artificial intelligence-generated text. But the best strategies to distinguish between the two may come from the chatbots themselves.
Too good to be human?
Several recent studies have highlighted just how difficult it is to determine whether text was generated by a human or a chatbot.
Research participants recruited for a 2021 online study, for example, were unable to distinguish between human- and ChatGPT-generated stories, news articles and recipes.
Language experts fare no better. In a 2023 study, editorial board members for top linguistics journals were unable to determine which article abstracts had been written by humans and which were generated by ChatGPT. And a 2024 study found that 94% of undergraduate exams written by ChatGPT went undetected by graders at a British university.
Clearly, humans aren’t very good at this.

A commonly held belief is that rare or unusual words can serve as “tells” regarding authorship, just as a poker player might somehow give away that they hold a winning hand.
Researchers have, in fact, documented a dramatic increase in relatively uncommon words, such as “delves” or “crucial,” in articles published in scientific journals over the past couple of years. This suggests that unusual terms could serve as tells that generative AI has been used. It also implies that some researchers are actively using bots to write or edit parts of their submissions to academic journals. Whether this practice reflects wrongdoing is up for debate.
In another study, researchers asked people about characteristics they associate with chatbot-generated text. Many participants pointed to the excessive use of em dashes – an elongated dash used to set off text or serve as a break in thought – as one marker of computer-generated output. But even in this study, the participants’ rate of AI detection was only marginally better than chance.
Given such poor performance, why do so many people believe that em dashes are a clear tell for chatbots? Perhaps it’s because this form of punctuation is primarily employed by experienced writers. In other words, people may believe that writing that is “too good” must be artificially generated.
But if people can’t intuitively tell the difference, perhaps there are other methods for determining human versus artificial authorship.
Stylometry to the rescue?
Some answers may be found in the field of stylometry, in which researchers employ statistical methods to detect variations in the writing styles of authors.
I’m a cognitive scientist who authored a book on the history of stylometric techniques. In it, I document how researchers developed methods to establish authorship in contested cases, or to determine who may have written anonymous texts.
One tool for determining authorship was proposed by the Australian scholar John Burrows. He developed Burrows’ Delta, a computerized technique that examines the relative frequency of common words, as opposed to rare ones, that appear in different texts.
It may seem counterintuitive to think that someone’s use of words like “the,” “and” or “to” can determine authorship, but the technique has been impressively effective.
Burrows’ Delta, for example, was used to establish that Ruth Plumly Thompson, L. Frank Baum’s successor, was the author of a disputed book in the “Wizard of Oz” series. It was also used to determine that love letters attributed to Confederate Gen. George Pickett were actually the inventions of his widow, LaSalle Corbell Pickett.
A major drawback of Burrows’ Delta and similar techniques is that they require a fairly large amount of text to reliably distinguish between authors. A 2016 study found that at least 1,000 words from each author may be required. A relatively short student essay, therefore, wouldn’t provide enough input for a statistical technique to work its attribution magic.
More recent work has made use of what are known as BERT language models, which are trained on large amounts of human- and chatbot-generated text. The models learn the patterns that are common in each type of writing, and they can be much more discriminating than people: The best ones are between 80% and 98% accurate.
However, these machine-learning models are “black boxes” – that is, we don’t really know which features of texts are responsible for their impressive abilities. Researchers are actively trying to find ways to make sense of them, but for now, it isn’t clear whether the models are detecting specific, reliable signals that humans can look for on their own.
A moving target
Another challenge for identifying bot-generated text is that the models themselves are constantly changing – sometimes in major ways.
Early in 2025, for example, users began to express concerns that ChatGPT had become overly obsequious, with mundane queries deemed “amazing” or “fantastic.” OpenAI addressed the issue by rolling back some changes it had made.
Of course, the writing style of a human author may change over time as well, but it typically does so more gradually.
At some point, I wondered what the bots had to say for themselves. I asked ChatGPT-4o: “How can I tell if some prose was generated by ChatGPT? Does it have any ‘tells,’ such as characteristic word choice or punctuation?”
The bot admitted that distinguishing human from nonhuman prose “can be tricky.” Nevertheless, it did provide me with a 10-item list, replete with examples.
These included the use of hedges – words like “often” and “generally” – as well as redundancy, an overreliance on lists and a “polished, neutral tone.” It did mention “predictable vocabulary,” which included certain adjectives such as “significant” and “notable,” along with academic terms like “implication” and “complexity.” However, though it noted that these features of chatbot-generated text are common, it concluded that “none are definitive on their own.”
Chatbots are known to hallucinate, or make factual errors.
But when it comes to talking about themselves, they appear to be surprisingly perceptive.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.
Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

(Wisconsin SEA Grant)Through executive orders and the Republican reconciliation bill signed into law in July, the administration of President Donald Trump has cancelled or proposed the cancellation of about $75 million in grants and loans meant for climate-focused projects in Wisconsin, according to data collected by the environmental policy group Atlas Public Policy. 
The cancelled projects include money for the state’s Department of Military Affairs to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change and a grant for the Milwaukee-based water quality non-profit Reflo, Inc. to help children in the city learn about sustainability and the environment. 
Since taking office in January, Trump and congressional Republicans have attacked federal government efforts to address climate change by slashing programs and withholding money. Many of the projects that have lost money in Wisconsin were aimed at marginalized communities such as Native American tribes and Milwaukee’s Black residents — putting them under the Trump crosshairs because of his aversion to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
Through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the administration of President Joe Biden targeted billions of dollars to help communities undertake projects meant to help transition to renewable sources of energy, restore local waterways and make homes more energy efficient. 
Under Trump, that money has been clawed back as Republicans have become even more hostile to efforts to address climate change. For example, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who represents much of northern Wisconsin and is considering running for governor next year, has spent a significant amount of time fighting the construction of solar energy in the state. 
“The loss of this funding represents a profound missed opportunity for Wisconsin, especially for its most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities,” says Jaclyn Lea, an associate at Atlas Public Policy. “These canceled projects would have supported investments in communities building energy efficiency, workforce development, and climate resilience. The impact of these cancellations will be felt across the state, slowing progress on critical environmental and resilience efforts.” 
Milwaukee energy efficiency
Among the projects that have lost their funding is a grant program under the Inflation Reduction Act to help the city of Milwaukee’s Environmental Collaboration Office work with non-profit organizations to help residents of the city’s predominately Black north side and predominately Latino south side connect with programs to make their homes more energy efficient. 
About $200,000 of the $1 million grant would have supported energy audits of 250 homes in the two neighborhoods. Many of the aging homes in the city have problems with old electrical systems, causing energy bills to rise for some of the city’s poorest residents and posing a fire risk. The program would have also helped connect residents with programs to weatherize their homes and remediate lead contamination. 
Erick Shambarger, Milwaukee’s director of environmental sustainability, says the program would have helped the city’s lowest income residents —  who are at the greatest risk of environmental harms —  lower their energy costs while helping the city as a whole cut emissions. 
It was rolled back as part of the tax- and spending-cut mega-bill that congressional Republicans passed this summer and Trump signed into law on July 4. 
“We also have to do a better job of maintaining and improving our existing housing stock,” Shambarger says. “And this was one tool that we had to try to do that, and it got pulled away. And then now you look at all of the other things that the big, ugly bill did in terms of eliminating tax credits for energy efficiency and all of the rest. And so this isn’t just one [decision], there’s a real pullback at the feds to support low- to moderate-income households.” 
He adds that the grant program project highlighted the ways it would help minority communities because that’s what the Biden administration was looking for, but he doesn’t think the program should be controversial. 
“At the end of the day, we are trying to help the people that need the help the most, help them save on their energy bills and help them get their families stabilized, and create better environments for kids, and better environmental conditions for kids to have a better chance in life,” he says. 
Shambarger says that political instability is one of the greatest obstacles to addressing climate change. The instability caused by the Trump administration taking back money the federal government had already promised to deliver makes it more difficult for industries and businesses relying on more predictable government action, he adds. 
“It is just very, very frustrating just to not have the consistency of policy that we need to address the climate crisis,” he says. “It should be frustrating for every American, including our contractors, who have to plan for the future, who have to hire workers with skill sets, and all of that takes time to set up training programs for new industries. It takes time to build partnerships for the financing for all of this.”
Shambarger is particularly frustrated by the federal government canceling contracts in midstream. 
“It’s one thing to say ‘wind down this contract, and maybe you don’t get renewed, and you have time to adjust,’” he says, “but to just terminate stuff without notice, without looking into the particulars of what our program was achieving is really, really disruptive.”
The effects of climate change are here, Shambarger says. Wisconsin and the Midwest have faced days of poor air quality because of wildfires across Canada this summer. Floods have continued to get worse every year. 
Meanwhile, lower-income working Americans are getting less help, “and that’s too bad, because this country, in order for it to really be great, we’ve got to make sure that we are providing really safe and affordable housing that is climate resilient,” he says.
Global warming continues to heighten risks, from wildfire smoke in the Midwest air to floods and wildfires threatening cities, “and all of that threat is not going away,” Shambarger says. “We just appeal to all levels of government to recognize that there is something we can do about this … It’s a benefit to all Americans.”
Brothertown Tribe wild rice restoration 
Another project cancelled by the Trump administration is a $3 million grant meant to help researchers at the University of Wisconsin work with the Brothertown Indian Nation to restore wild rice habitat in the Lake Winnebago watershed and study the effects of that restoration on the lake’s water quality. 
While the project would have helped the tribe connect with a plant that many of the state’s tribes view as sacred, it would also have served as a wetland restoration project on the drinking water source for hundreds of thousands of people in the Fox River valley. Wetland restoration is a major tool for improving water quality because wetlands can serve as a sort of filter to block potentially harmful nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrates from running off of farm fields and into the water system. 
“There’s over 200,000 people that rely on Winnebago alone for drinking water, and we know the positive impact of having better health for that water,” Jessica Ryan, the tribe’s vice chair, says. “And the community has been trying to improve the water quality for a long period of time in that area. But there’s, there’s a long way to go yet. There’s tremendous negative impacts that have happened from prior generations. So we need to keep our foot on the gas.” 
The grant was meant to fund five years of rice seeding and studying to see if the rice population can be increased and if that increase can improve the quality of water, both for drinking and for supporting populations of fish such as sturgeon and waterfowl such as geese and ducks. The grant was designed as a collaboration between indigenous and western methods of science and involved a number of the state’s tribes as well as local groups and farmers.
“We’d like to have the support of all of the state and the federal politicians to support us because we see the similarities in these interests,” Ryan says. “We see how it lifts up the entire community. Regardless of whether we’re American Indian or not, we have this common core value of looking after the land and the water.”
Those values are shared by local farmers and by the large tribal communities in the area — along with the Brothertown, the Oneida, the Stockbridge and the Menominee, she says. 
The Brothertown Indian Nation began in 18th century New England as a community of Christian Native Americans. The tribe later moved west to Wisconsin to avoid the conflicts over land that pushed out most of the East Coast’s native populations. The tribe settled east of Lake Winnebago. 
But in 1838 the federal government then tried to force the tribe out of Wisconsin and into Kansas. Looking for a way to prevent the government from taking their land, the tribe requested the allotment of their land and U.S. citizenship. Members believed that this would allow private ownership of their land and protect the tribe. 
But unbeknownst to the members, this agreement terminated the federal government’s recognition of the tribe — ending its status as a sovereign nation. The tribe continues to work toward once again being recognized by the federal government. But Ryan says that the Trump administration’s cancellation of the Brothertown grant was especially painful because it was another promise to the tribe broken by the U.S. government. 
“The federal government, in my opinion, has an opportunity to make it, to do the right thing, and they have chosen not to do the right thing,” she says. “They’ve chosen to do the opposite. And I don’t know what’s behind that decision making, right? Like, I don’t know if it’s a political decision, if it’s a racial decision, I don’t know what that is, but to us as the recipients who worked diligently, we’ve complied with all that’s been expected of us. We followed the rules, right? And the application process, it was a competitive process. We were selected. And to have the government again unilaterally go back on its word, it’s pretty devastating.” 
Because the tribe isn’t recognized, it has very little resources. All of its budget comes from charitable support, grants and what the tribe can make selling crafts at its store. It can’t cover the work that was supposed to be covered by a $3 million grant. For now, the tribe has kept one person on its payroll to keep collecting data through the project and is hoping for volunteers to help with the additional work. 
“We had so much good in mind that we were going to do with the funds that would benefit far more than just us,” Ryan says. “This was going to have a tremendous positive impact on the entire community within the watershed. It’s not just something that was going to look after our people or a small group of people. This was intended to have a statewide positive impact.”
The research the tribe wants to continue collecting “is something that can be used on a larger model for the entire region,” Ryan says.  “This is a long-term ecological restoration effort, and we are three years into this project, and it’s a really critical, pivotal moment.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Monitoring-broll.00_08_22_29.Still024-1536x864-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-08-05 06:56:27.909671

(Courtesy photo provided by Apple/Distributed by the Oklahoma Film and Music Office)OKLAHOMA CITY — Amid a period of tremendous growth within Oklahoma’s film industry, over three dozen communities have signed onto a state program designed to signify that they’re ready to host productions.
In all, 39 communities and one tribe have completed the requirements of the Oklahoma Film Friendly Community Program, officials said.
Created in 2021 by the Oklahoma Film and Music Office, the free program helps cities and tribes across the state prepare for and attract film productions by providing certification to signify a community’s readiness to host productions. It also provides Oklahoma communities with resources that educate and assist them in preparing for incoming film and television productions, which supporters say can result in economic growth.
“Achieving certification signifies to the film industry a community’s readiness to host productions, which can lead to increased economic impact for local businesses and workforce opportunities for residents,” said Yousef Kazemi, the state film office’s outreach and production manager. “The requirements of our program let film and television productions know that those communities which are certified have systems and a collaborative process in place to best support their business needs while filming on location.”
Required steps include creating of an enforceable permit approved and enforced by the city, designating a film friendly liaison and subcommittee to serve as a first point of contact, and photographing and identifying at least 10 different sites which could potentially be used for filming, Kazemi said.
“Communities need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to attract and support film and television productions, thereby promoting economic development and cultural enrichment across Oklahoma and ensuring these productions keep coming to Oklahoma,” he said.
Since 2021, when Oklahoma lawmakers increased the cap on a film rebate program from $8 million to $30 million, the industry has “seen tremendous growth,” Kazemi said.
“Ultimately, our programs are about facilitating economic growth, job creation, and cultural enrichment in communities across Oklahoma through the promotion of the film and television industry, and that in itself is highly rewarding,” he said.

Oklahoma ranked sixth in employment growth, fourth in total compensation growth, and ninth in annual compensation per worker growth among the states that have a film incentive, said Jeanette Stanton, director at Oklahoma Film and Music Office.
In 2024, productions taking advantage of the state’s film incentive are estimated to have created 4,173 jobs, she said.
Among the most notable productions filmed in Oklahoma are: “Twisters,” a Hollywood blockbuster about storm chasing; “Reservation Dogs,” which follows Indigenous teens living in rural Oklahoma; “Tulsa King,” a television series that stars Sylvester Stallone;  “Killers of the Flower Moon,” an Oscar-nominated movie exploring the murders of members of the Osage Nation tribe and the birth of the FBI; and “Unbreakable Boy,” which tells the story of an autistic child with brittle bone disease.
Tulsa is one of the communities that has achieved the certification.
Since becoming certified, the community has hosted one of its notable productions, “Tulsa King,” said Meg Gould, executive director of Tulsa Film, Music, and Arts Office.
Gould’s office actively builds location packages for incoming productions, has a directory dedicated to different locations people can film at and also has a place where people can register their own site as potential production locale.
She said property owners interested in being considered for future projects can upload photos to the database.
“We’re still seeing a lot of tourism from ‘The Outsiders’ movie,” Gould said. “Now with ‘The Outsiders’ musical we’re getting even more attention. We had ‘Reservation Dogs’, which brought a different type of audience to Tulsa.”
To help communities and tribes reach film friendly status, the state offers workshops designed to help them prepare. The workshops cover topics such as obtaining necessary permits, establishing effective protocols, and understanding the production process.
“Having that film-friendly certification ahead of time is telling productions that we’re camera-ready-communities, we’re able to kind of get your film permits and work through this process,” said Maggie Cunningham, Cherokee Film’s interim film commissioner and senior manager. “We know what this is going to look like already. We’ve been through the training.”
Since becoming accredited, the Cherokee Nation has hosted over 30 productions such as “Osiyo, Voices of the Cherokee People,” “Fancy Dance,” and upcoming “Cottonmouth.”
The city of Edmond has served as a filming location for several productions since becoming certified 2021, said Sarah London, Edmond’s special events coordinator.
“These films bring people and tax dollars while supporting local businesses,” London said. “Edmond has seen an increase in filming. Because we are film friendly certified it helps us get noticed as a filming location, especially for companies that are coming in from out of state.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Members of an advisory council overseeing next year’s America250 in Idaho celebration are encouraging cities and counties to apply for funding to enhance their local celebrations and events.
Idaho cities and counties may apply for up to $2,500 to support their local America250 celebrations for things like parades, public art, educational exhibits and other events honoring the United States’ founding, according to a press release issued Thursday by the office of Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, who serves on the advisory council.
“We all get to be a part of the 250th birthday of this great experiment we call America,” McGrane said in a written statement. “We want to celebrate in a big way here in the Gem State and make the lead-up to July 4, 2026, an experience to remember. This fund gives Idaho communities the chance to create meaningful and memorable events and projects that bring people together.”
Funding for local America250 celebrations represents a new direction for America250 in Idaho funding.
Earlier this year, the advisory committee cancelled grants for 29 different nonprofit and arts organizations after legislators chairing the advisory council said they wanted to be hyper-focused on America250 celebrations and founding of the country, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

 After grant fund awards canceled, Idaho seeks to fund celebrations across the state

Idaho council cancels grants for America250 selectees who were already told they’d receive funds

The canceled grants ranged from $4,000 to $25,000, and the nonprofit and arts organizations had already applied for them and been notified they were selected to receive the funding before the grants were later cancelled. 
Instead, funding will be available to help local communities with America250 celebrations across the state. 
“The Celebration Fund is a great way to support local efforts already underway to recognize this historic anniversary,” said Kelley Packer, executive director of the Association of Idaho Cities. “It gives communities the flexibility to shape meaningful events that reflect their own local flavor.”
Sen. Ben Adams, a Nampa Republican who serves as co-chair of the advisory committee, agreed.
“This is a rare and meaningful moment in our nation’s history,” Adams said in a written statement issued Thursday. “We want every Idahoan to feel connected and part of something greater. I’m looking forward to seeing how communities use this fund to bring people together and honor our shared story.”
 One canceled grant would have helped tell underrepresented story of Chinese immigrants in southern Idaho

The Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission had been one of the recipients of the nonprofit and arts grants before their $25,000 grant was cancelled, the Sun previously reported.

The funding would have been used to complete the final phase of an archaeological survey of Chinese gold mining sites near Twin Falls, tell the underrepresented story of Chinese immigrants’ impact on mining in Idaho and help establish a National Register Snake River Canyon Historic Mining District, according to the grant application. 
But on March 24, members of the Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission received a letter from Adams and Rep. Brandon Mitchell, R-Moscow, telling them the grant program through America250 was cancelled. 
The legislators said that they had met with Idaho State Historical Society Executive Director Janet Gallimore to discuss how the grants comported with the advisory council’s vision for America250.

The Wyoming Business Council says it has more policy ideas forthcoming to address ""vicious"" shrinking workforce conundrum.
The post Proposal to address ‘nation’s worst workforce exodus’ fails to get support from Wyoming lawmakers appeared first on WyoFile .","Motivated by glaring evidence that Wyoming stands at the precipice of a long-term economic decline, driven by a shrinking workforce, the Wyoming Business Council brought the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee a proposal to help communities better attract and retain workers.  
Lawmakers last week, however, declined to sponsor that draft legislation, which would have changed state statute to impose a higher minimum matching dollar amount for a key community economic development grant and loan program. Committee members worried the change would exclude poorer communities from getting the help they need.
“It didn’t make it past committee, and that’s okay,” Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell told WyoFile. “Really our goal was to just begin to develop a cadence with that committee where we’re going to bring [more] policy recommendations that we think are going to make a difference in Wyoming and have that open dialogue.”

For all of Wyoming’s efforts to attract the interest of nuclear energy developers, hydrogen energy hopefuls, carbon storage engineering, data and artificial intelligence computational centers and bitcoin miners, it doesn’t have the bounty of workforce to accommodate them, according to the business council. 
In fact, Wyoming is losing its homegrown talent. Some 60% to 70% of Wyoming-born residents permanently leave the state by the time they are 30, according to analysis prepared for the agency. That, in turn, makes it more difficult to attract other workers and the businesses that would otherwise employ them here.
It’s a “vicious cycle,” Dorrell said. “We don’t have enough people to attract the jobs and we don’t have enough jobs to attract the people.”
“In Wyoming, most people have to leave to go to a city to fulfill their ambition,” Dorrell added.

Wyoming Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell.
Wyoming’s past efforts include a “Home Grown” initiative under former Gov. Matt Mead.
How does that challenge connect to a potential strategy of increasing the mandatory dollar match for the Business Ready Community grant and loan program from a varied scale to a flat 25%?
It comes down to a most bang-for-your-buck strategy, Dorrell said, beginning with a focus on backing shared infrastructure and enticing communities to rally behind projects that truly raise the potential for all businesses and job opportunities — not just a single benefactor or niche.
“We’re concentrating our effort [for example] in those places like Casper and Natrona County so that we can really kind of instigate that population growth in an area that supports it, and in an area that already has population,” Dorrell said. “From an economic standpoint, it makes a ton of sense to do that.” 
It’s controversial, Dorrell admits, and there are many other factors that contribute to the workforce chicken-and-egg conundrum, like a dearth of daycare and lack of affordable housing. 
“We are better than anyone in the nation at exporting our children,” Dorrell said. “But is that what we want?'”
For now, the business council is focusing on improving the tools it already has while hitting the streets to begin conversations about other looming factors like a mineral extraction-based tax-and-revenue system that actually makes it more costly for Wyoming communities to increase their populations.
Young people from Wyoming leave the state at among the highest rate of any state in the nation, according to analysis commissioned by the Wyoming Business Council.
“We’re going to be asking some big asks,” Dorrell said, hinting at more proposed initiatives to come. “We’re going to be looking for policies and investments that make a difference in our state, and it’s not going to look normal. It’s not going to look like whatever everybody has always said.”
Worland Republican Rep. Martha Lawley quizzed Dorrell about how raising the minimum grant and loan match might punish smaller, less-monied Wyoming communities.
“Have you guys ever considered having kind of a different track, so to speak, with some different requirements and different opportunities for smaller rural communities and some of the unique challenges that they face,” Lawley asked.
“Yes and no,” Dorrell said, adding there is a track record of some small communities mustering match dollars for a particular project, which is typically an indication of where a particular community wants to stake its economic future.
It’s true, Dorrell said, “Very small communities face a unique challenge. It turns out that almost every one of our communities is facing a similar challenge of resources versus the idea of growing. It’s a challenge for us.”
But enticing each community to get “more skin in the game” is most important, he added.
In light of the Minerals Committee declining to back a 25% match in state statute, the business council will continue to do just that via rule changes, Dorrell told WyoFile.

From simple searches to ChatGPT, the big digital buildup threatens the grid and water supplies.
The post The West’s thirsty data centers appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by High Country News.
This May, STaX Capital Partners applied for a permit to install turbines fueled by methane from oil wells on Alaska’s North Slope. The temporary facilities would serve as a proof of concept for a much larger gas-fired power plant — with an output equal to that of the state’s largest coal-fired plant — all of whose electricity would go to a planned bitcoin-mining data center located nearby.

Analysis

The Alaska-based company told Northern Journal it hopes to “create the playbook for sustainable, at-scale Bitcoin mining in Alaska.” 
But “sustainable” bitcoin mining is an oxymoron, given the enormous amounts of power and water data centers consume. The massive server banks that run nearly every aspect of our digital world churn away in warehouse-like buildings in Phoenix, Las Vegas, rural Washington and Wyoming, each gobbling as much electricity as a small city to process AI queries, cryptocurrency extraction and other aspects of our increasingly cloud-based society. The harder they work, the hotter they get, and the more power and water they need to cool off. 
The International Energy Agency predicts that data centers’ electricity and water consumption will both double by 2030, driven largely by AI-related demand. That in turn threatens to max out existing electricity generation, strain power grids, and — if fossil fuels are used — increase carbon emissions. Even when data centers employ dedicated solar, wind or geothermal, they’re taking resources from other users, upending utilities’ planning and prompting them to build yet more natural gas plants while keeping nuclear and coal plants running — and polluting — well past their scheduled retirements. 
Some states, including Oregon, want to make data centers pay their fair share of electricity and infrastructure costs rather than pass them on to other customers. At the same time, several Western states and local governments offer taxpayer-funded incentives to attract more data centers, even to water- and grid-constrained areas, while utilities welcome the additional profits increased demand will bring. Both the Biden and Trump administrations eagerly offered up federal land and resources for new data centers and the power-generating facilities they need. 
The Big Digital Buildup is underway and shows no signs of stopping. The question is how — if possible — to mitigate its inevitable impacts.    

Data center hot spots

Tax credits and other incentives in seven Western states, along with their lower electricity rates, have lured data center developers to Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Arizona.

The growth of data center capacity is highest in the West. 
Some of the nation’s fastest-growing server-farm hubs are in the region. Google is investing $400 million to expand its Nevada data centers, driving exponential growth in Las Vegas and Reno. The facility’s total power demand is expected to exceed 3,800 megawatts — enough to power more than 3 million homes. 

Data and drought 

Thirsty data centers are sprouting like weeds in parts of the West that are already arid and now gripped by severe drought. In the greater Phoenix area, proposed housing developments have died due to a lack of available groundwater. Yet data centers, each of which can consume an entire sprawling subdivision’s worth, face no such requirements or water restrictions. 
Data centers use energy to run their servers, and energy and water to cool the processors. Evaporative chillers that work in low humidity use less energy but more water, while refrigerated cooling uses less water but requires more energy on-site. And power generation generally guzzles water, too, thereby increasing data centers’ indirect water use. 

A Microsoft data center in Goodyear, Arizona, directly uses about 56 million gallons of municipal potable water annually — about the same as 670 homes. Still, it’s substantially less than what the nearby alfalfa fields drink.


The cloud and climate



Some data centers have built dedicated solar installations, others plan to purchase wind and geothermal power, while still others want to install their own modular nuclear reactors to run the “hyperscale” centers needed to process AI. Meanwhile, most server farms get at least some of their power from the local grid, typically paying industrial rates far lower than what residential customers pay. 
The carbon intensity of a specific center hinges on the energy mix of its grid. Coal and natural gas generation still dominate the Interior West’s grid, meaning its data centers are responsible for larger greenhouse gas emissions and water use for power generation. In the Pacific Northwest, myriad server farms are powered mostly by hydroelectricity, which is low-carbon but hurts rivers and fish. California’s grid runs increasingly on solar power.


Comparing data’s hunger for energy and water


AI-powered search models use 10 times more energy than a standard Google search. 
Data centers need water for cooling, and because AI-processing facilities work harder, they need more cooling and even more water. 
TIP: Include “-ai” after your Google search terms to exclude Al-powered results.

When lawmakers abandoned free market ideals to save King Coal, columnist Kerry Drake opines, they stuck Wyoming electric customers with higher bills.
The post It’s time to toss Wyoming’s carbon capture mandate on junkpile of bad ideas appeared first on WyoFile .","When events strangely align to put politically polar-opposite camps together, people always wonder how it happened. But there’s really no mystery why the Freedom Caucus that controls the Wyoming House and the Legislature’s few progressives both want to repeal a 2020 law designed to “save” the coal industry.

Opinion

It was a terrible idea then, and it looks even worse today. The more people who come to that conclusion, no matter their political beliefs, the better off Wyoming will be.
Requiring regulated electric utilities to meet federal pollution regulations by retrofitting coal-burning power plants with carbon capture technology was always a Hail Mary plan that should’ve never seen the drawing board, much less advanced.
But the Legislature and Gov. Mark Gordon refused to let the free market determine the fate of the coal industry, which led to Wyoming being the only state that requires a coal-burning utility to study implementing a system that has never proven commercially viable. The latest research shows that carbon capture is unaffordable and would result in huge increases in Wyoming customers’ bills.
Yet it remains on the books. The Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee was divided on sponsoring a repeal bill last month. Seven of eight representatives in attendance voted in favor of it, but only one of five senators backed it — not enough to achieve the majority required to sponsor the measure.
The proposal was brought to the committee by Rep. Christopher Knapp, R-Gillette, a Freedom Caucus member who sponsored a similar measure earlier this year that failed. “Why are we continuing to charge the end user for something that probably will not pan out?” he asked the committee.
In May the U.S. Department of Energy cancelled $3.7 billion in federal grants to support “clean energy” demonstration projects, including $49 million for a “large-scale” carbon capture pilot project at the Dry Fork Station coal-fired power plant north of Gillette.


“Dry Fork has been identified in different studies as the lowest-cost plant in the country to attempt this technology,” University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby told WyoFile. “If it won’t work here, where will it work?”
Knapp’s House Bill 209, “Carbon capture mandate-repeal,” was supported by the Freedom Caucus, the more moderate Wyoming Caucus, and all six House Democrats in February. The lone vote against it in its final reading was cast by Rep. Lloyd Larsen, R-Lander. But the Senate Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee killed it without even a vote, signaling the sharp divide between the two chambers on this issue.
In 2020, House Bill 200, “Reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standards,” was approved before the Freedom Caucus came into power. The House approved it 39-19, with most of the rag-tag team of GOP rebels at the time — including now-Secretary of State Chuck Gray — voting no. 
The Freedom Caucus likes to characterize opponents of repealing the bill as “liberal Wyoming Republicans,” mythological creatures who don’t actually exist except in their minds. But seven very real left-leaning House Democrats and one independent voted against the carbon capture mandate, which should bury once and for all the Freedom Caucus’ claim that liberals consider it “green” technology.
It’s never been the choice of lawmakers who want Wyoming to offer more renewable energy like wind and solar, and quit artificially pumping up a dying coal industry.
The Freedom Caucus’ chief complaint about carbon capture has always been that Gordon wants it, so it must be bad. Its members went apocalyptic when the governor visited Harvard University in October 2023 and addressed how new carbon capture technology would help achieve his net-zero carbon goal for Wyoming.
“We can’t afford to give an inch to the anti-fossil fuel crowd and Mark Gordon needs to explain to the people of Wyoming why he’s selling our economy and our livelihoods down the liberal river,” then-Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, told Fox News. 
For many years, the Wyoming Republican Party was united by the belief that climate change is a hoax. That’s still what the Freedom Caucus and its allies preach. The best example is Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Lingle, one of the 10 Senate no votes for the carbon capture mandate in 2020. She and Bear co-sponsored this year’s Senate File 92, “Make carbon dioxide great again-no net zero.” It didn’t make it out of Senate Minerals.
Steinmetz and her fellow climate change deniers on the Senate Agriculture Committee sponsored a “hearing” in February 2024 that will go down as one of the weirdest events in the Capitol’s history. It featured the CO2 Coalition, a traveling band of “scientists” with very dubious credentials, and began by Steinmetz ruling that no opposing views would be heard.
But despite it being a scientific-fact-free day, I can’t argue with Steinmetz’s economic message: taxpayer funds shouldn’t be used for carbon capture, and until the mandate is repealed, “Wyoming ratepayers will pay for these policies.”
Rocky Mountain Power’s customers in Wyoming have subsidized about $3.9 million worth of technical and economic feasibility analysis of carbon capture; Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power’s customers have paid nearly $900,000. The latter’s parent company, Black Hills Energy, said the most viable technology it’s found would cost about $500 million. 
The utility’s 45,000 customers in the Cheyenne area — and I’m one of them — can start practicing their best Howard Beale impersonations. For younger readers, that’s the “Network” movie newsman who screams, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore!”
And it gets worse: Black Hills Energy’s carbon capture retrofit at the Wygen II power plant near Gillette would knock down the coal plant’s electric generation capacity by more than 30%. That means the company will need to replace about 30 megawatts of lost power. Guess who will be on the line for that?
In Gordon, Wyoming elected a Republican governor willing to say that climate change is real and the state must adapt its economy to the energy transition. Hallelujah and all that, but does that slice of real life have to come with requiring utilities to use unproven, unaffordable technology that will bankrupt us, instead of much less expensive renewable energy we already know reduces greenhouse gas emissions? 
It’s time for the Legislature to repeal its 2020 mandate and quit trying to pick winners and losers. Hey, that sounds like something the Freedom Caucus would say. Politics does make strange bedfellows. 
While it sometimes makes me cringe to see myself and like-minded progressives and environmentalists on the same side as climate change deniers, on this issue, I’ve gotten over it. Personal motivations aside, what’s important is doing the right thing for the state, country and the entire planet.

(Courtesy of the National Park Service)VALENTINE, Nebraska – Some fans of Nebraska’s Niobrara River describe a proposal to shift management of the scenic river to state and local entities as the biggest threat to the popular paddling destination since a long-abandoned plan to dam the river.
The Norden Dam proposal – which would have flooded the now-popular stretch of the Niobrara for float trips – was eventually scrapped, and in 1991, a 76-mile stretch of the spring-fed stream was designated as a National Wild and Scenic River.
By many accounts, it’s been a success story, with an average of 75,000 people a year now paddling and visiting the river, and motels and other businesses that cater to tourists popping up in Valentine and other nearby towns.
But now State Sen. Tanya Storer, whose district includes the scenic river area, has proposed shifting the management of the river from the National Park Service to entities in Nebraska: to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission as well as the Niobrara Scenic River Council and the Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District.
Storer says that with federal funding of the Park Service in limbo, it makes sense to explore whether the state should take over. The senator adds that she feels state and local entities could manage the river more efficiently.
“There’s no intent to do anything to take away from the benefits and the value of the scenic river,” Storer said. ”It’s just putting management in the hands of local people, who frankly understand the culture better than anybody.”


Public hearing scheduled
A proposal to have state and local entities take over management of the Niobrara National Wild and Scenic River is the subject of a state legislative interim study, LR 158.
Interim studies often result in a bill being introduced in the next legislative session, and a July 17 meeting held at the Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District office and organized by its general manager, Mike Murphy, was billed as a “move toward” bill introduction in January.
A public hearing on LR 158 is scheduled for Sept. 19. Only invited testimony will be taken, but the public can attend. A report on the interim study of taking over management from the National Park Service is to be released by year’s end.


Another proponent, Mike Murphy of the Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District, said that with almost all of the land along the scenic stretch in private ownership, it just makes sense to have management with local entities.
“The federal government trying to manage private property is the whole issue,” Murphy said. “Honestly, we feel that we have the things in place to manage it, instead of the feds telling us what to do.”
Fans of the Niobrara, including the group that led the fight against the Norden Dam, don’t see it that way.
They maintain that the participation of the National Park Service has added management expertise and national exposure to the Niobrara, and their work has helped to reduce the “party” atmosphere on the stream that was keeping some families away and maintained the scenic beauty of the river.
“It is a national treasure and a good fit for a national entity to preserve it forever, for the entire nation and not just the state of Nebraska,” said Sandra Washington, a retired planner with the National Park Service, now a member of the Lincoln City Council. “The federal government is well placed to continue to do that, even with budget cuts.”
An official with Friends of the Niobrara — which grew out of Save the Niobrara, the organization led the fight against the Norden Dam — said it’s not a stretch to describe Storer’s proposal as the biggest threat faced by the river since the dam.
“The National Park Service has the skillset and the resources to maintain a good visitor experience and to watch over the quality of the river,” said Kimberly Stuhr of Springfield, the president of the Friends group.
Both Stuhr and Washington said they doubt that the State of Nebraska, given its recent budget shortfalls and additional expected budget cuts, has the funds to maintain the management of the river, which now gets $1.1 million a year from the feds.
A staff of seven full-time Park Service employees do law enforcement, safety rescues, education, outreach and research programs, as well as test the water for quality and quantity.
“There’s a lot of things they do to protect the river,” Stuhr said, “and I don’t know if the state has the resources and people to do that.”

There’s also concern that state and local management will lead to additional irrigation along the river, to the detriment of flows for float trips, and that the preservation of the scenic corridor will erode — contentions that both Storer and Murphy dispute.
From the start, there’s always been some tension between the feds, who want to preserve the river from excess development that degrades the scenic views, and the locals, who don’t always like someone telling them where they can build a cabin, a shed or establish a new canoe access site.
As sort of a compromise, the federal government allowed the formation of a local committee, the Niobrara Council, to provide local input from private landowners, canoe outfitters and county officials about management of the scenic river.
Storer, who served seven years on the river Council, said it’s been a resounding success by giving voice to local landowners about river management. Others, though, like Stuhr, question how well they’ve worked with the Park Service and what, besides maintaining a couple of vault toilets, they’ve accomplished.
There also was a critical state audit report, issued in June, in which the River Council was slammed for giving $7,000 in bonuses to its two employees, and for paying out $40,000 over 21 years to its executive director, Kalli Kieborz, for allegedly unused vacation time. (State Auditor Mike Foley cited, at the time, Facebook posts that showed the executive director ice fishing during work hours.)
Kieborz told the Examiner that the concerns raised by the auditor have been addressed and resolved by the Council.
But the 16-member Council has faced funding issues in recent years and earned an “anti-government” reputation from some eight years ago when it rejected, on a 10-1 vote, a plan by the Park Service to purchase an iconic take-out spot on the Niobrara, the Rocky Ford, a set of rapids where many float trips end.
Talks of such a purchase were revived last year, but died after the Trump Administration — which is seeking to sell off some public lands — took over.
This spring, Kieborz and a member of the Council pleaded with state legislators to increase funding for its operations, given a loss of federal funding. The Council had a $100,000-a-year cooperative agreement with the Park Service, but last year it was reduced by $20,000 after an agreement over how much work the Council needed to complete could not be reached.
The cooperative agreement with the Park Service expired in April, and a federal freeze on renewing such arrangements prevents any new such contracts.
That left the Council with only $52,500 a year from the state to operate. In response, Kieborz’ position has been reduced to 20 hours a week, a part-time office helper was laid off, and the group’s operations — like maintaining the toilets and operating summer day camps — were dropped, though they’ve since been picked up by other agencies.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Storer said that the role of the Council, to provide input from local landowners and agencies, would continue if management was taken away from the Park Service. Murphy, a current member of the Council, said that the summer camps and toilet maintenance could be restored if funding was again available.
The senator said both Gov. Jim Pillen and the head of the Game and Parks Commission gave her the thumbs up to pursue — via an interim study this summer — how the state could assume management of the river.
Both Storer and Murphy said they doubt whether a lot of additional funds would be needed from the state to take over management, though Murphy said it all depends on what management exactly is required — such as law enforcement and education — for a federally designated scenic river.

The Park Service does allow some federal designated scenic rivers to be managed locally, via a “partnership” arrangement, though the Niobrara National Scenic River was established by Congress to be managed by the Park Service. It would take another act of Congress to transfer management to the state.
Washington, the former Park Service planner, worked on scenic river management when she was employed by the parks agency in her home state of Ohio. She said that there’s at least two federally designated scenic rivers in Ohio, the Little Beaver and the Little Miami, that are managed by that state. But Washington said that only was allowed because of Ohio’s prior expertise in managing such resources.
“There are rules on how these rivers are to be managed,” she said. “The state would need to assure the public, and the public nationally, that Nebraska has the means to take care of the river in the same way it’s been taken care of for future generations.”
The Niobrara Council, of which Murphy is a member, has yet to take a stand on whether to support a state takeover of the river. That issue, however, will be on the council’s agenda in August.
“There’s a lot of questions to be answered,” and it’s premature to take a stand, said Mary Mercure, a Valentine outfitter who sits on the river Council.
Murphy said he feels there’s been a lot of misinformation about Storer’s proposal, and that it is being wrongly lumped in with a push by the Trump Administration to sell off federal lands for development. There’s little federal land in the Niobrara corridor, he said, and what there is — the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge — would not be sold.
Local entities, Murphy and Storer said, are already doing much of the necessary work, so not much, in their opinion, would change.

But preservation groups like Friends of the Niobrara feel that federal management has worked well, and has maintained the wild and scenic qualities of the river. There’s no need to change, they say, adding that the State Game and Parks Commission already has trouble staffing its operations along the Niobrara, chiefly Smith Falls State Park.
One group, the Nebraska Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, has already come out in opposition of a management switch, saying that “public use would likely suffer and habitat would be degraded under state control.”
Washington, who chairs the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association, which is dedicated to protecting and preserving national parks, said that organization cannot support a state takeover of the Niobrara.
Stuhr, of the Friends of the Niobrara, said she doesn’t believe the river Council and NRD have been good partners with the Park Service, and doubts whether they will be good managers of the river.
“I understand where they’re coming from. I wouldn’t want people coming through my property either,” she said. “I also don’t want to see the Niobrara River become a big commercial operation. It is a very special place.”

President Donald Trump’s phaseout of clean energy tax credits will make solar and wind projects more expensive, but some states are still committed to clean energy mandates. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.










We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce


“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
 Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
 A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) is urging residents to get vaccinated amid the confirmation of the first measles cases in the state this year and as families begin back-to-school preparation with vaccine rates still down. 
DHS confirmed nine cases of measles in Oconto County over the weekend — the first cases in the state this year. The agency said no public points of exposure have been identified and the risk to the community remains low. 
The first case was confirmed through testing at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, and the eight other cases were confirmed based on exposure and symptoms. Each person was exposed from a common source during out-of-state travel.
Dr. Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer of DHS’s Bureau of Communicable Diseases, told reporters during a press conference Monday afternoon that given the number of cases across the country, the agency has been preparing for its case investigations and outbreak response for months. 
“While we were surprised that we had our first cases this past week, we were prepared,” Westergaard said. “We’ve been making sure that we have adequate MMR vaccine in stock and have worked in partnership with all of our local and tribal health departments to make sure that we have a solid response that everyone is aware of, and so far for this case,… things have gone well.”
  Ryan Westergaard, M.D., Wisconsin Dept. of Health Services
Cases of the highly contagious disease have hit a 33-year high nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There are reports of over 1,300 cases this year, with more than 150 people having been hospitalized for measles. Three people have died this year. 
Measles was declared eliminated in 2000, but decreasing vaccine rates, which have fallen below herd immunity, have led to a resurgence of the disease. Prior to 2025, the last similar outbreak was in 2019 when more than 1,200 cases were confirmed in the U.S. 
Westergaard said the state agency is not considering the nine cases in Wisconsin an outbreak because  the investigation found a common source during out-of-state travel. He said the agency won’t be releasing additional information about the cases due to state privacy laws. The agency has said it is working to identify and notify people who may have been exposed. 
The agency is urging families to get vaccinated in light of the cluster of cases and reported Monday that vaccination rates among students mostly held steady during the 2024-25 school year. Vaccination rates are still below pre-pandemic levels. 
“Vaccination is the first line of defense for your child’s health. Each vaccine is approved only after being proven safe and effective,” Stephanie Schauer, director of the Wisconsin Immunization Program, said in a statement. “Taking time now to ensure your children have received the recommended vaccines will make them less likely to get seriously ill, meaning less time out of school and away from work. And routine vaccines don’t just protect your child — they help keep classrooms and the whole community safe.”
During the 2024-25 school year, 86.4% of students met the minimum immunization requirements — a 2.8 percentage point decrease from the 2023-24 school year. 
“This tells us that most Wisconsin families are protecting their children with vaccines,” Westergaard said at the press conference. “Unfortunately, this level is below where we need to be to protect our state against outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. As we head into the new school year as a physician and as the father of kids who attend public schools, I want to encourage all caregivers to reach out to a trusted health care provider with any questions or concerns that you have to concern to ensure that students are up to date on their vaccines this year.” 
The agency attributed the overall decrease in meeting the immunization requirement to people being unfamiliar with a new meningitis vaccination requirement for 7th and 12th grade students. Without data on the meningitis vaccination, 89.3% of Wisconsin students met the minimum requirements — a 0.1% increase from the 2023-24 school year.
DHS reported in December that families in the state have fallen behind other states when it comes to receiving childhood vaccines including polio, pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus (DTaP), and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). When it comes to measles in particular, Wisconsin has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.
Measles can spread from person to person through the air, and the vaccines to prevent it are highly effective. One dose of the MMR vaccine provides about 93% protection from measles, while two doses are about 97% effective.
“Our school vaccination data tells us there are children in our schools who are not protected from an outbreak of preventable diseases like measles,” State Health Officer Paula Tran said in a statement. “In public health, we know that 95% of people in a community need to be vaccinated against measles in order to prevent an outbreak, which is why it’s so important to get children the vaccines they need on time.”
Milwaukee city leaders, looking to take preventative steps due to the measles cases, also urged residents to get vaccinated on Monday.
“As a father and as mayor, I take this threat seriously,” Mayor Cavalier Johnson said in a statement. “We’ve seen how quickly diseases can spread when vaccination rates fall behind.”
Children’s Wisconsin President of Pediatrics Dr. Mike Gutzeit emphasized that serious side effects from the MMR vaccine are rare. 
“The risk from measles itself is far greater. When families choose not to vaccinate, they’re not just putting their own children at risk, but also newborns and people with weakened immune systems,” Gutzeit said. “Measles was nearly eliminated in the U.S., but now we’re seeing hundreds of cases and hospitalizations again. We can’t afford to go backward.”
Other vaccine-preventable illnesses surged in classrooms last year, according to DHS. Nearly 3,000 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, were reported.
The measles cases and data on school vaccine rates come as some Republican lawmakers are seeking to increase awareness of vaccine exemptions. Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) and Rep. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) recently introduced a bill that seeks to highlight Wisconsin’s vaccine exemptions, saying there isn’t enough transparency around them. Current law already requires that schools and day care providers “inform the person in writing of the person’s right to a waiver.” 
During the 2024–2025 school year, 6.7% of students had a waiver for one or more vaccinations. Of those, 5.8% of students had a personal conviction waiver, 1% had a religious waiver and 0.4% had a health waiver. 
Westergaard said the rate of waivers in Wisconsin is higher than other states. 
“We’re one of only 13 states that has the personal conviction waiver. Many states do not allow that,” Westergaard said, adding that health forms typically include notice of the waiver availability. 
“We feel in public health that knowledge of the exemptions of the waivers is commonplace,” Westergaard said. “We don’t hide them, but our recommendation is that people get their kids vaccinated because we, as a public health entity, feel any risks far outweighed by the benefit, both to individual health and to our community health.”
Westergaard said those with concerns should speak with a trusted physician and be open with their questions. 
“For many families, childhood immunizations are a fact of life, and they’ve accepted them when they’re recommended, but we know other families have questions and concerns,” Westergaard said. “If there are questions you have, if there is information that you’ve seen online or heard that makes you question the safety or the effectiveness, let’s talk about them… There’s near unanimity among people who have seriously reviewed MMR safety data and other childhood vaccine data that they are on balance very safe and very effective and continually monitored for safety and adverse effects.”

When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.

Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado counties on the Western Slope wrote to state leaders expressing their intention to treat enforcement of certain state laws optional under a provision in Colorado statutes that says the state must provide adequate funding if it mandates an increase in services. 
County commissioners in Mesa and Garfield counties said the Colorado Legislature needs to reconsider the volume and scope of “unfunded mandates,” as they require county governments to dedicate more time and resources without the financial support to do so. They also said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis should veto such policies. 
“These unfunded mandates, issued without the financial support required to implement them, place an unsustainable burden on local governments and the citizens we serve and undermining both fiscal responsibility and the principle of local control,” both counties said in their letters, addressed to Polis, Senate President James Coleman and House Speaker Julie McCluskie, all Democrats.

Both county letters referenced a provision in Colorado statute that says when the state increases the level of service required by law, it must provide adequate funding to do so, or the mandates are considered optional. Mesa County’s letter said it instructed county staff to begin considering certain laws that don’t include state funding as optional and that county attorneys are “prepared to defend our exercise of statutory remedies,” though commissioners hope “this does not lead to unnecessary litigation.”
“As elected officials representing communities of diverse political perspectives, we are united in our commitment to uphold this statutory protection and exercise it with discretion,” both letters said. 
Mesa County Commissioner Bobbie Daniel told Newsline that counties “across Colorado” plan to send similar letters, which they are reviewing “with their respective boards, legal, risk, and finance teams.”
While Garfield County’s letter did not address any specific laws of concern, Mesa County highlighted five laws commissioners said will lead to “substantial, uncompensated costs.” That includes a 2023 law that establishes a wildfire resiliency code board and a 2024 law that prohibits local governments from using certain forms of turf. Three other laws highlighted in the letter, all passed in 2021, concern energy benchmarking and performance standards, law enforcement accountability and information technology. 
Mesa County estimated the laws could each cost the county hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.   
Republican support for the laws
The 2024 turf restriction law and the 2021 information technology law both passed the Legislature with bipartisan support in a House and Senate with Democratic majorities. Republican state Sen. Janice Rich of Grand Junction in Mesa County voted in favor of both of those policies, but said she supports her county commissioners and their letter “100%.” 
“Over the last seven years that I’ve been in the Legislature, time and time again it’s been unfunded mandates that have come down and burdened the local government,” Rich said. “I worked in local government for 16 years, I was the elected county clerk for eight years and the elected treasurer, and I know and I understand what those burdens are when the state puts that burden on local government.” 
Other Mesa County Republicans in the Legislature, Rep. Rick Taggart of Grand Junction and Rep. Matt Soper of Delta, voted in support of some of the laws, too.  
Rich said the standard language to describe how a bill will affect local government spending is “minimal impact,” and that any attempts to debate that on the floor “just falls on deaf ears.” She said she likely “took their word for it at the time” when she voted in support of those policies.
“If the majority party comes right out and admits that it’s an unfunded mandate, they know full well it’s probably not going to pass,” Rich said. 
In a statement emailed to Newsline, McCluskie said the laws Mesa County wrote about “are important for public safety, water conservation and wildfire protection.” 
“I deeply value our partnership with local governments, and I am always willing to collaborate and engage in productive discussions with them about the issues they are raising,” McCluskie said in a statement. “Additionally, we expect counties will soon face a flood of new inquiries due to the devastating impacts of H.R. 1, especially regarding Medicaid and SNAP. It is crucial now more than ever to work together so we can better serve the people of Colorado.” 
H.R.1, also known as President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” is the tax break and spending cut bill recently passed by Congress.
Eric Maruyama, spokesperson for Polis, said in a statement that bills are funded based on fiscal analysis from nonpartisan staff at the Legislature in accordance with state law, though the governor is “open to suggestions about how to reduce costs.”
“Major items like reducing fire risk and protecting our water are truly statewide concerns,” Maruyama said. “The Governor is on the Western Slope regularly meeting with businesses and hardworking Coloradans, and appreciates hearing from any county commissioners and understands the importance of ensuring local tax dollars are used to maximize the quality of life for Coloradans.”

Sarah Stevens ahead of the 2026 race, new campaign finance reports show.
Earls, a Democrat and the court’s senior associate justice, reported raising more than $580,000 for the first six months of the year, and entered July with nearly $482,000 in cash on hand. Her campaign spent $117,237 during the first half of the year. 
Stevens, a state House member from Surry County and former House speaker pro tempore, reported raising about $141,000 since announcing her run in May. Her campaign spent nearly $14,500 and ended the reporting period with about $156,000 in cash on hand.
Earls’ average donation was under $300, with contributions coming from more than 1,900 individual donors. Over 80% of her fundraising came from within North Carolina, and she drew strong support from attorneys, professors, and social workers. Attorneys alone contributed more than $54,000. 
The North Carolina Democratic Party also contributed nearly $129,000. Earls received more than $80,000 from out-of-state donors, with notable contributions from Massachusetts, California and New York. 
“Our team is proud of the record-breaking work we are doing on this campaign,” campaign manager Mary Alice Blackstock said in a July statement. “Justice Earls is running this race in every corner of the state, and our fundraising is further proof of that. North Carolinians know how important this election is and what’s at stake.” 
Stevens reported fewer overall contributions but a much higher average, about $1,500 per donor. She contributed $7,624 to her own campaign and received the maximum $6,800 from former state Rep. Harold Brubaker,  who served as a House speaker in the ’90s and now runs a lobbying firm. She also received donations from GOP lawmakers’ political committees including “Citizens for Destin Hall” and “Committee to Elect Brenden Jones.” Hall is the current House speaker and Jones is the House majority leader.



Professionally, Stevens’ donor base included attorneys, business executives, retirees, and individuals, listed their job titles as “president” and “business manager.” She raised  $13,000 from out-of-state donors, mainly in Virginia and California. 
The 2026 election will decide one of seven seats on the state’s highest court, which currently has a 5–2 conservative majority. Earls, first elected in 2018 after a long career in civil rights law, is the court’s most senior Democrat and a frequent dissenter in rulings involving redistricting, voting rights, and public education.

Democrats kept the Supreme Court seat held by Justice Allison Riggs after former Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin conceded his 2024 race earlier this year. The concession followed a monthslong legal challenge in which Griffin had questioned the eligibility of about 60,000 absentee ballots, primarily from military and overseas voters. State and federal courts rejected his claims, and a federal judge ordered the election certified. 
The victory was a key step in the Democratic strategy to reclaim a majority on the court before the next round of legislative and congressional redistricting in 2030. Given the high likelihood of legal challenges to that process, it’s widely assumed that the composition of the court will be extremely important.

(Courtesy photo)As our congressional delegation continues to vote to stop “wasteful” spending, we’ll see and hear about more and more people who will suffer from their actions.
Besides the thousands who will lose their health coverage from cuts to Medicaid, cuts to public media could put residents in danger during natural disasters.
West Virginia Watch reporter Lori Kersey reported on a radio station in Pocahontas County that has lost 70% of its budget after Congress voted to revoke $1.1 billion in previously approved spending for public broadcasting. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, as well as Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore, all voted in favor of the bill. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law late last month. 
“I’m proud to cast my vote for this commonsense rescission package — the days of wasting money with zero regard for the taxpayer are over,” Justice said in a news release. “This package helps keep folks’ tax dollars from being spent on out-of-touch nonsense on the other side of the world and keeps it where it should be: in the pockets of hardworking West Virginians.”
Allegheny Mountain Radio has three stations — one in West Virginia, and two in Virginia — and all of them are losing substantial funding. The stations are non-commercial, and operated by volunteers and a small paid staff. WVMR, in Dunmore, has been on the air since August 1981.
AMR received government funding because the stations are “sole service providers” in the areas they serve — meaning they are the only reliable radio stations for some people.
“The (Federal Communications Commission) looks at the topography maps, signal strength of stations, etc, for that designation. While you can get other signals here, they are not always strong or clear, depending on atmospheric conditions,” AMR’s station manager Scott Smith said in an email.
When AMR posted Lori’s story on its Facebook page, one commenter expressed how important the stations are to him.
“What seems to be lost is the AMR stations are the ONLY reliable radio signals in that area of Virginia and West Virginia,” wrote Jeff Connors of Roanoke, Virginia. “In case of an emergency, there is no other radio station that could air the Emergency Alert System, and no way to inform the communities in case of power outages.”
Decisions like these are always short-sighted. Lawmakers often don’t think of the worst case scenario. Sure, we can get emergency alerts on TV, but many people no longer have cable and use streaming services — and if the power, cable or internet is out, they can’t reach you anyway.
Our smart phones put out tornado warnings, but what if winds have knocked down the cell tower or your phone is dead? If you have batteries and a radio (and please, make sure you have those in case of an emergency), then your local radio station can still reach you. 
Before Lori’s story, AMR had received more than 120 private donations after the news of their funding loss. Smith told Lori that number was up to 144 as of Friday morning. 
And while donations are great, they are not reliable funding. 
In 2024, Americans gave about $592.5 billion in charitable donations, according to the National Philanthropic Trust. Of that, individuals donated the most at $392.45 billion, followed by foundations with $109.81 billion, giving by bequest at $45.84 billion was next and corporations were last at $44.40 billion. 
Only about 9.5% of those donations went to the arts, culture and humanities. The top receiver of donations was religion at 23%, followed by 14% to human services, 14% to education, 11% to grantmaking foundations and 11% to public-society benefit.
And before you say “radio is a dying medium,” a Nielson report found that AM/FM radio reaches 91% of U.S. adults each month. Even in what is considered a hard-to-reach demographic — 18-34-year-olds — 87% listen to traditional radio each month. That number climbs to 93% for adults 35-49, and 92% for those 50 and older.
In West Virginia, where there are areas without cell phone service or broadband internet, those numbers could be even higher. 
Nielsen also found that traditional radio’s reach exceeds other music sources — like Spotify, YoutTube Music, Pandora, Apple Music, Amazon Music and satellite radio — across age groups.
On Friday, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced it is shutting down one day after  a major Senate appropriations bill did not include funding for public media, and following the Trump administration two-year rescission of funding agreed to by Congress.
The corporation helped provide Community Service Grants and raised money for 1,216 public radio stations and 365 public television stations, including Allegheny Mountain Radio and West Virginia Public Broadcasting. WVPB’s radio station lost 3% of its total revenue from the cuts, and its TV station lost 11%. Public broadcasting has 11 member stations throughout the state.
These stations provide free, vital news, and West Virginians should be worried that our lawmakers in Washington, D.C. see no value in that and call it “wasteful.” What they are really worried about is West Virginians being better informed.

It falls short of what schools need, and most importantly, it falls short of what students deserve.
That’s why I’m proud to support the Michigan Special Education Finance Reform Blueprint, better known as the MI Blueprint. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a smarter and more equitable funding model for special education. One that puts students, not systems, at the center.
The good news is that the momentum is real, and it’s been building for a long time.
Over the last seven months, more than 1,000 Michiganders have helped shape the MI Blueprint through surveys, stakeholder meetings, and open conversations across the state. Parents, educators, advocates, and school leaders have brought their insight to the table, working together to co-create a model that reflects what students actually need. This has been a transparent and inclusive process from the start, grounded in Michigan experiences and shaped by Michigan voices.
That community-driven momentum is being echoed at the highest levels. As we draw nearer to Michigan’s 2026 gubernatorial election,  candidates have begun sharing their education platforms with some including education funding reform as a priority.  Transitioning Michigan’s education funding approach to a weighted student funding formula that is decoupled from local property wealth and instead focused on what students need just makes sense. This alignment– from families and advocates to statewide leaders– underscores the urgency and the opportunity in front of us.
Right now, Michigan reimburses districts for just 28.6 percent of special education costs. That’s one of the lowest rates in the country. This leaves districts scrambling to meet their legal and moral obligations with insufficient state support. The burden falls hardest on low-wealth communities that can’t raise additional local revenue and are restricted by caps on millage increases, deepening existing disparities and limiting opportunity for the students who need the most.
This is not just a budgeting problem. It is a civil rights issue.
The MI Blueprint project was launched in response to this challenge, through bipartisan action by the state legislature. Since then, we’ve drawn from the best available research, including recent costing-out studies in neighboring Ohio and the groundbreaking School Finance Research Collaborative adequacy study here in Michigan, and applied it to local data, policy context, and lived experience.
Now we are in the home stretch with the model taking shape and a final report due to the legislature this October. It will include a clear and actionable framework with a new weighted funding formula that can create a fairer, more predictable system.
This is not a theoretical exercise. It is a blueprint for change, and it has the backing of many advocates, educators, and families across Michigan.
To fellow educators and district leaders: you’ve helped  shape this process every step of the way. Your continued engagement matters. Let’s finish strong.
To families across Michigan: this is about your children. Their needs and your voices are the backbone of this effort. Every child deserves the resources they need to succeed, no matter where they live or how much support they need, and the MI Blueprint helps us get there.
And to our legislative leaders: the table is set. You asked for an objective, data-informed framework, and the MI Blueprint delivers. As you consider education priorities this fall, this is an opportunity to follow-through on what you asked Michiganders to deliver to you.
We don’t get opportunities like this very often. Let’s seize it, together.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/students-and-teacher-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-08-05 06:56:27.909671

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)OMAHA — Former Texas Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke is coming to Nebraska Tuesday to highlight the House redistricting push by Texas Republicans and hear from Nebraskans about America’s future. 
He’s having a town hall at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Scott Conference Center. The former Democratic presidential candidate has been traveling the country and hosting townhalls with his voter organizing group, Powered by People. O’Rourke is trying to make the case that helping Texas Democrats to stop the Trump administration’s “power grab” is critical for Democrats nationally. 
The GOP-majority Texas Legislature is proposing a new congressional map designed to give the GOP five additional seats in the U.S. House next year, which could spur a national, state-by-state redistricting fight ahead of next year’s midterm congressional elections. 
O’Rourke also plans to emphasize that Nebraska will likely be back in the national spotlight in 2026, because of an open-seat race after the pending retirement of Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon in the Omaha area.
“What happens in Texas will affect everybody in the country,” O’Rourke said “What happens in Nebraska’s Second Congressional District is going to affect everybody in the country.” 
Some national pundits and political experts have argued that the 2nd District race could be one of a handful that decides which party controls the House.  The district has already drawn national attention for its single stray presidential Electoral College vote that has swung from Republicans to Democrats in recent years, most recently to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

O’Rourke joins a trend of prominent Democrats and progressives making their way to Nebraska. 
Vermont Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his “Fighting Oligarchy” nationwide tour in Omaha. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz hosted a Democratic town hall earlier this year. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is coming to Nebraska in November to speak at the Nebraska Democratic Party’s top annual fundraiser. 
O’Rourke has been advocating for Democratic governors to “fight fire with fire” in redistricting as Texas Republicans try a rare change in the middle of the decade. 
Most states redistrict after a new Census. The Texas effort is currently paused because Texas House Democrats fled Texas in an effort to block or delay adoption of the GOP majority’s proposed congressional maps.
“Democrats previously have been over-concerned with coloring within the lines,” O’Rourke told the Examiner. “[Democrats] are more focused on being right than being in power. Meanwhile, Republicans have only cared about being in power.” 
Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has entertained the idea of retaliating with her own effort to redraw maps, as has Democrat-led California. 
O’Rourke says national Democrats need a stronger response to President Donald Trump’s gains among working-class voters, including minority voters. He said Democrats have to be “just as ruthless” to gain more power, or it could be hard for Democrats to “stop the consolidation of authoritarian power in America.” 
Democrats in Texas, like in Nebraska, have struggled lately to win a statewide race. It’s been roughly 30 years in Texas, and since U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., in 2006, O’Rourke said he sees it as “a privilege to be fighting in these states.” 
He said the path to power for Democrats is to invest in states that aren’t traditionally seen as swing states and “fighting for every single person.” 
O’Rourke said states like Texas and Nebraska, which often get “written off,” could play a major role in helping “provide a check on Trump’s lawlessness.”
“The coalition has to be as broad as possible, so we’ve got to welcome Nebraska Republicans and Nebraska Independents and Nebraskans who voted for Donald Trump last time,” O’Rourke said. 
The Texas Democrat unsuccessfully ran for president in 2020 and for governor of the Lone Star State in 2022. He said he is still entertaining the idea of running for U.S. Senate in Texas and potentially a 2028 presidential bid, but said he has “plenty of time to think,” as the filing deadline is in December. 
O’Rourke said he has heard from people at his town halls that they want Democrats to go on the offensive. 
“We gotta come together,” O’Rourke said. “Both states have a chance to tip the balance of power in America through the House of Representatives.”

This year, housing for Middle College will be moved off campus. (Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)Fairmont State University is expanding its on-campus housing and educational program for teens in foster care, announcing that it will now serve local foster children living with a foster family or relatives. 
The program, known as Middle College, launched in 2024 as West Virginia has struggled to have enough homes for kids in foster care, particularly older teens. There are 6,132 children in the state’s child welfare system. 
Middle College has provided housing to 16- to 18-year-olds in the foster care system while helping them complete a high school diploma and work on an associate degree before aging out of care. 
Only half of all youth in foster care earn a high school diploma, and between 2% and 6% go on to complete a college education.
The university announced Monday that the program will expand to include 16- to 17-year-olds in foster care who live in the surrounding area with their guardians. They will not need to relocate in order to receive the educational services.
“We know how important permanency is to youth with experience in care,” said Middle College Dean Emily Swain in a news release. “This expansion will allow students to remain in a supportive environment while pursuing their educational goals. Expanding the program to meet these needs will open the doors for even more students to experience Middle College.” 
The program is now accepting applications.
Middle College was launched through a partnership with KVC West Virginia and the West Virginia Schools of Diversion and Transition to address the state’s foster care crisis. 
“Programs like Middle College reflect what it truly means to be a public university,” said Dr. Mike Davis, president of Fairmont State University. “We have a responsibility to lift up every student with the potential to succeed — and that includes students who may not have had the support or resources they deserve. When we give them access to education and opportunity, we don’t just change their lives — we strengthen our communities and our state.” 
Middle College’s housing and educational program has been free and available to foster teens statewide. 
Students have access to support services, including mental health care. 
Middle College initially housed teens on-campus in a dorm, but earlier this year, the program opted to move the teens to off-campus housing after the Times West Virginian reported that a foster teen ran away from the program to Kentucky. In response, a spokesperson for the program said that Middle College student safety was a priority and the university needed additional space in the residence hall for its students.

Credit: (Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to federal health care spending, passed last month as part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” could mean that, over the next 10 years, millions more Americans will be left without health insurance of any kind. But the sweeping domestic policy bill — which Trump signed into law on July 4 — won’t just impact American households. They could also hit public school budgets.
School districts across the country rely on federal Medicaid dollars to pay for medical services and counseling for students, as well as related personnel expenses, such as school nurse salaries. Medicaid payments to schools total more than $7 billion every year, including tens of millions every year to Louisiana public schools, according to a Healthy Schools Campaign study released this March.
But much of that funding could be at risk following the passage last month of Trump’s massive domestic policy bill.  For schools, particularly those in high-poverty areas such as New Orleans — where 60% of children are enrolled in public health insurance programs — Medicaid cuts could mean less access to health care for students.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The cuts could also stretch school budgets in other areas. Schools are legally required to provide certain medical services, such as for students with disabilities who are enrolled in a special education program. Jessie Mandle, the national program director of the Healthy Schools Campaign, said some schools may have to make difficult budget decisions — weighing cuts to non-medical staffing, building maintenance or school programming — in order to pay for those services.
“I want to make sure that school districts understand that these tough decisions that they’re making now are directly connected … to the provisions of this bill, that they are not making these devastating choices in isolation, that they are making these decisions because of the provisions of this bill,” Mandle said.
Rather than direct budget cuts, the new law achieves Medicaid cost savings primarily through changes to how the program is administered — including a work requirement and a more stringent renewal process — that will make it harder for people to qualify for and stay on Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that nearly 12 million people could lose health coverage over the next decade as a result of the changes.
Schools that provide health services to students enrolled in Medicaid bill their costs to the program through the Louisiana Department of Health. The department reimburses schools for the health care services they provided over the school year, including the salaries of the people who provided them. Money from the reimbursements can be reinvested anywhere in the school, increasing the amount of funding that schools have access to in a given fiscal year.
But if fewer students are enrolled in Medicaid, then less Medicaid money will be available to schools.
Sabrina Corner, a Medicaid recipient whose son, Kaleb Bolden, is in eighth grade at Mary McLeod Bethune Charter School in Gentilly, said the school’s medical services have been instrumental in making sure he takes his medication. Kaleb, who has Type 1 diabetes, needs to take insulin after every meal and any period of physical activity, including gym and band class.
“The school plays a big part,” Corner said. “Because he is a child, he can’t do it himself. He needs to have supervision and of course I can’t just leave my job or wherever I am to give him the meds. And it’s very important that he gets his meds because it’s his life. He has to take this in order for him to live every day.”

It’s not clear how much Bethune receives in Medicaid reimbursement funding. Though it’s a charter school governed by an independent nonprofit board, it is one of five charter schools for which the NOLA Public Schools district administers federal funds. As a result, unlike most New Orleans schools, it does not independently report its Medicaid reimbursements to the Louisiana Department of Education.
Bethune school officials did not respond to emails and phone calls from Verite News.
According to school financial data maintained by the Department of Education, public schools across the state received about $85 million in Medicaid reimbursements during the 2023-2024 school year, the last year for which financial data is readily available. Of that, $5.3 million went to schools in New Orleans, a Verite News analysis found.
Nearly half of that went to KIPP New Orleans Schools. With eight schools in its portfolio, KIPP New Orleans is the largest charter school operator in the NOLA Public Schools district, which is made up almost entirely of charters.
According to Kristen Horwood, director of budget planning and fund administration for KIPP New Orleans, the charter network received about $900,000 this year in Medicaid reimbursements for this school year. But that number has previously been much higher. In the 2023-2024 school year, for example, Medicaid reimbursements to KIPP New Orleans schools totaled more than $1.9 million, according to state records.
“Without that funding, we’d have to scale back on everything,” Horwood said. “We would have to reduce workforce. We would have to reduce programs, including academic interventions for students. It’s just basically getting down to the basics, which is not enough to give our students what they need.”
Special education services could be threatened, too
Under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which governs special education services, public school students with disabilities must be placed on education plans tailored to their needs.
Such plans may call for students to be given extra time on tests or provided access to speech-to-text software for assignments. But they can also include medical services, such as physical therapy, mental health counseling or speech pathology.
Schools are legally required to follow those plans. And the federal government reimburses certain medical costs for special education students  — but only if they’re enrolled in Medicaid.
Nationwide, Medicaid cuts in schools are expected to lead to school health staff layoffs, a reduction in mental and behavioral health services and a reduction in resources for students with disabilities, according to the March survey of 1,440 public schools across all 50 states by Healthy Schools Campaign. The combined effects of these rollbacks will affect student achievements, survey respondents and Horwood said.
Melissa Francis, a New Orleans parent union organizer with grassroots advocacy group Step Up Louisiana, agreed.
“The students who have disabilities often rely on Medicaid to cover therapies for speech, physical therapy, occupational therapy,” Francis said. “I know these cuts will limit these services, making it harder for them to function in school.”
And New Orleans schools already struggle to accommodate students’ individual education plans, Francis said. The Orleans Parish School Board has been under a federal consent agenda since 2015 that monitors school compliance with IEPs for students with special needs. In the decade since, monitors have found that half of the schools in the district in noncompliance with special education requirements.
Until about a decade ago, schools were only eligible for Medicaid funding that was directly tied to special education. But in 2014, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services changed existing policy so that health care costs for all Medicaid-enrolled students are reimbursable, even if those services — such as vision and hearing exams — are free for all students.
Louisiana was the first state to expand its school-based Medicaid program in 2015, allowing reimbursements for nursing services delivered to all students on Medicaid. And in 2020, Louisiana expanded the program to cover all medically necessary services for students on Medicaid. New Schools for New Orleans, an education advocacy group, found in 2023 that New Orleans schools had an estimated $10.5 million in possible Medicaid reimbursable funding, but due to complexities in billing and lack of resources, schools were only receiving around 40% of that. Since then, New Schools for New Orleans, the Orleans Parish School Board and the New Orleans City Council have collaborated to increase the amount of Medicaid reimbursements schools receive.
Orleans Parish School Board member Olin Parker said the NOLA Public Schools district has made expanding access to physical and mental health services for students one of its priorities. He fears that reduced Medicaid reimbursements will force schools to make cuts elsewhere in their budgets to keep up with federal requirements for special education students.
“Now you’re spending your own fund balance on what used to be reimbursable services, that means you have less money to pay your teachers,” Parker said. “That means you have less money to invest into your school buildings. That means you have less money to invest in the programming that’s happening at your schools.”

(Getty Images)Memphis organization Just City dedicated $50,000 toward paying bail for low-level offenders on Friday in honor of Rockez McDaniel, a 33-year-old who recently died while awaiting arraignment in the Shelby County jail.
McDaniel faced misdemeanor charges for evading arrest and escape after officers arrested him in response to a mental health call, according to court documents.
Officers tased McDaniel after he shoved one of the responding officers in an attempt to escape, police say. He made a second attempt to escape after being taken to Regional One Hospital for unspecified medical treatment. 
After being medically cleared at the hospital, McDaniel was taken to the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center, also known as 201 Poplar. There he stayed — without arraignment or assigned legal representation — for seven days until his death.
His bond was set at $1,000 — a price he was unable to pay for his release, according to Just City.

The Shelby County Sheriff’s Office reported that McDaniel died on July 28 after experiencing a “medical emergency” while in custody. 
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is investigating the circumstances that led to his death. An autopsy is being performed, according to TBI.
Organizations launch Rockez McDaniel Bailout
In response, Just City and a coalition of local organizations launched the Rockez McDaniel Bailout, an emergency $50,000 allocation from Just City’s Memphis Community Bail Fund.
The bailout effort is targeting people who have been incarcerated in the jail for about a week with little or no movement in their case. Just City typically pays a maximum bail of $4,000 per person, a bail threshold that is generally set for lower-level charges. The organization also completes internal checks on types of charges and history before issuing bail payments.
“It didn’t take us long to find 30 people who are in a position that is very vulnerable if they have any sort of health problems at all,” Just City Executive Director Josh Spickler told Tennessee Lookout. 
“These are people who have not been convicted of a crime, have not faced a judge or a jury, and who have not received a sentence, yet they are being held in dangerous, inhumane conditions for weeks on end,” Spickler said. “The purpose of the Rockez McDaniel Bailout is to locate and free as many of them as we can before another life is lost to the Sheriff’s negligence and disorganization.”
The organization’s Memphis Community Bail Fund posted pretrial bail for about 500 people from 2015 to 2020, according to a 5-year report published by Just City. Of those bail fund clients, 91% returned to court, the organization reported.
Organizations demand accountability from Sheriff’s Office
Just City and partnering organizations also issued three demands to the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office. Those include:

Releasing a training plan and committing employees and resources to the jail’s intake and release departments, with the goal of reducing booking time to 36 hours by Sept. 1, and further reducing it to 25 hours by the end of 2025.
Releasing a plan for employees to monitor the daily jail roster for people who have not been taken to court or received appointed counsel within 48 hours of booking, with the goal of getting all inmates to court within 72 hours of booking.
Releasing a plan to divert people with diagnosed mental health conditions to available resources within 24 hours of arrival, with the goal of entirely avoiding booking people who are experiencing mental health episodes into the jail by Jan. 1.

A representative from the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. 
Just City Bail Fund and Advocacy Coordinator Laramie Wheeler said McDaniel would still be alive had he been taken to court as scheduled.










These are people who have not been convicted of a crime, have not faced a judge or a jury, and who have not received a sentence, yet they are being held in dangerous, inhumane conditions for weeks on end.

Court records show McDaniel’s arraignment was initially set for July 21, the day after his arrest. Bail screening forms showed the court did not recommend release without supervision because of the “nature of offense, probability of conviction and the likely sentence as it relates to the safety of the community.”
But the arraignment — and a required bail hearing review — never happened. The court date was rescheduled to July 22, and then to July 28, before finally being pushed to July 29. By that time, McDaniel was dead.
“From what we can tell, the thing that got in the way, the thing that caused Mr. McDaniel to die at the hospital after being found unresponsive in intake, was that he had not been taken to court,” Wheeler said.
“Rockez McDaniel would still be here if the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office had done their job,” she said. “And the family, his friends, all of us here today — we want to know why he was never seen in court. We want to know why he was never assigned an attorney. We want to know why they did not do their jobs … No one deserves to die while being held in jail.”
Sheriff’s Office has requested funds for new jail
The Sheriff’s Office issued a news release on July 24 — four days before McDaniel’s death — advocating for funding for a new jail facility. The release cites a rise in bookings, court slowdowns, and delays state transfers for inmates who have been convicted and sentenced to time in a state penitentiary. 
Sheriff Floyd Bonner, Jr. hired retired Criminal Court Judge Bobby Carter to assist in working with other criminal justice agencies to reduce the jail’s population. Bonner also employs an “Expeditor” who “attempts to get cases on the docket more quickly when inmates are hospitalized” and assists in obtaining more rapid mental health evaluations and testing, according to the release.
“(Bonner) is also moving many of those charged with misdemeanors to another part of the jail to keep them safe while they are awaiting court appearances, bond, release, etc.,” the release states.
The jail staffs a mental health team, including a full-time director and part-time psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, according to the jail’s website. 
It’s not clear what, if any, treatment or resources McDaniel received while in custody.
Spickler rejects the idea that a new jail is a solution. 
“(McDaniel’s death) did not happen because the jail was 50 years old,” he said. “This happened because a whole chain of people did not do their jobs. Most of them work for the sheriff.”

Patrick Morrisey (right) stands beside U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins (sitting) who holds up a signed waiver allowing the state's SNAP program to ban the purchase of sugary drinks. (Gov. Patrick Morrisey's X account)The U.S. Department of Agriculture has officially approved West Virginia’s plan to disallow the use of federal food assistance benefits to purchase soda and sugary drinks.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Monday joined USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for a news conference announcing approval for West Virginia’s waiver for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. SNAP program benefits are paid for by the Department of Agriculture and administered through the state.
Morrisey noted during the press conference that West Virginia ranks low or near the bottom of several public health metrics like obesity and diabetes. 
“I believe in telling the truth to the American people about where we are because that’s going to make the rise all the more better when West Virginia is able to reach her potential and to get healthy again,” Morrisey said. “The good news today is that we all have the power to change. And I think the people on stage here today, the wonderful staffs are working at the federal level and the state level to make that happen. I think you’re going to start to see some needle movement in all these categories.”
The waiver, which Morrisey formally requested in May, will also allow the state’s SNAP program to purchase some hot foods served from grocery store delis.
Changes to the SNAP program are one part of Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. West Virginia was one of the first states in the nation to pass a sweeping ban of artificial dyes in foods sold in grocery stores and restaurants, another part of the MAHA agenda. The state also banned the use of food dyes in school lunches.
“For years, SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy — products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,” Kennedy said in a news release. “These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health. I thank these governors who have stepped up to request waivers, and I encourage others to follow their lead. This is how we Make America Healthy Again.”
The SNAP changes are also part of a health initiative Morrisey called the “Four Pillars of a Healthy West Virginia.” Other pillars included prohibiting the sale of certain food dyes in the state, and the “Mountaineer Mile” challenge to walk at least a mile a day.
Morrisey said the changes to the SNAP program are “long overdue.”
“I’m happy now that in West Virginia, taxpayers are not going to be subsidizing soda and these sugary drinks — things that have no nutritional value and are directly linked to obesity, diabetes, a lot of other terrible health care outcomes,” he said. 
One in six West Virginians, or approximately 277,000 residents, rely on the SNAP program for food assistance, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. 
In addition to West Virginia, Rollins signed SNAP waivers for the states of Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. The waivers change the statutory definition of food for purchase and end the subsidization of popular types of junk food, according to a news release from HHS. The changes take effect in January. 
The federal government approved SNAP waivers for Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Arkansas, Idaho, and Utah earlier this year.
“It is incredible to see so many states take action at this critical moment in our nation’s history and do something to begin to address chronic health problems,” Rollins said in a news release. “President Trump has changed the status quo, and the entire cabinet is taking action to Make America Healthy Again. At USDA, we play a key role in supporting Americans who fall on hard times, and that commitment does not change. Rather, these state waivers promote healthier options for families in need.”

Two veteran Democratic education advocates announced a new public school think tank and action fund this week aimed at making inroads in four Southern states. But the outfit may face an uphill battle in states like Alabama and Tennessee, where Republican supermajorities have backed privatization efforts in recent years.
The Center for Strong Public Schools Action fund will back center-left candidates in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, and Tennessee, in addition to investing at the legislative policy level with its think tank arm. Former Georgia state lawmaker Alisha Thomas Searcy and Texas education advocate Garry Jones co-founded the group.
Searcy said last week they narrowed their focus to four states where “both the threats to undermine public education and the opportunities to strengthen it are greatest.”
The initiative comes as Democrats have struggled to define their education policy agenda after the erosion of what had been a bipartisan consensus around public school choice and rigorous school accountability policies. Republicans have leveraged parental frustration with COVID-related school closures and conservative backlash to more inclusive curriculum to advance private school choice policies. At the same time, Democratic politicians have backed away from education reform and charter schools.
While CSPS Action said it will make strategic investments in high-profile contests like the upcoming Georgia gubernatorial and state schools superintendent races, the group would likely face an uphill battle on similar goals in Tennessee. The GOP continues to dominate politics in Tennessee, where Republicans hold an entrenched supermajority in the state legislature and Democrats have failed to make substantive gains in recent cycles.
A CSPS spokesperson said the group plans to focus more on state policy goals in Tennessee around accountability, funding equity for public charters, and literacy and math initiatives, though it could dip into more local issues like upcoming Memphis-Shelby County school board races.
Jones and Searcy said they have raised more $1 million from national and local donors, but they declined to answer questions about who is backing the effort.
Searcy noted CSPS aims to keep a spotlight on accountability, an issue that drew heated debate in the Tennessee statehouse earlier this year as Republicans pushed through Gov. Bill Lee’s voucher program. Though participating students must take a standardized achievement test, the program allows private schools to opt out of Tennessee’s standardized testing.
With a continued GOP focus on “privatization,” Searcy said there’s an opportunity for Democrats to “embrace public charter schools,” though she acknowledged there is no consensus within the party regarding public school choice.
“It seems that Republicans are sort of abandoning anything within the public school system,” Searcy said. “When you look at who’s being served in charter schools, many of those students are Black and brown students, many of them are low-income students. These are students that we need to make sure still have a voice, still have access to equitable resources, whether it’s funding or building, because they are all in public schools.”
In addition to public school choice and accountability, Jones said the group would focus on more equitable school funding, supporting teachers, and improving school safety. These priorities bridge areas of traditional Democratic strength with ones where Republicans have gained ground.
Searcy and Jones are both alums of Democrats for Education Reform, a group that once played an influential role in electing school board members and state legislators sympathetic to the reform agenda. Searcy was hired by DFER to expand its reach in some of the same states that now will be the focus of CSPS.
DFER has seen an exodus of longtime staffers amid leadership and strategy changes, and numerous state chapters have closed.
Democrats for Education Reform commissioned a poll in 2023 that found that Democrats had lost the trust of voters when it came to education. CEO Jorge Elorza at the time exhorted Democrats to embrace public school choice policies to win back these voters. In the wake of the 2024 election, Elorza went further, issuing a paper that called on Democrats to be more open to vouchers and educational savings accounts and to invest their political capital in steering these programs toward helping the neediest students.
Searcy and Jones said vouchers represent a bright line that they won’t cross.
“I want to be clear about what sets us apart,” Searcy said. “It’s our commitment to public education. It is foundational for us, and it’s nonnegotiable. We’re committed to remaining focused on strengthening public schools, not creating pathways that take away from them.”

That’s one in every 70 Missourians suddenly cut off from their doctors, clinics and hospitals.
Some patients lost access to cancer follow-up care, prenatal visits or stroke rehabilitation mid-treatment. Lawmakers heard public testimony from families facing serious care disruptions. One story, read aloud during a June 30 Missouri Senate hearing, involved a four-year-old who had undergone multiple heart surgeries and was at risk of losing her care team.
As her parent explained: “The burden this places on families like mine cannot be overstated. We’re not just talking about switching doctors. We’re talking about losing the very people that kept our daughter alive.”
 The disruption was massive and statewide.
This may have been a contract dispute on paper. In practice, it was an obstruction to care.
In rural Missouri, there was often no alternative. No other OB. No nearby specialist. Many rural counties are classified as maternity care deserts, with fewer than half of rural hospitals offering obstetric services. Patients often travel hours or wait months for neurology, if it’s available at all.
When in-network coverage ends mid-treatment, many have nowhere else to go.
Missouri does have a continuity-of-care law. But it is narrow, unenforced and largely unknown. It requires no patient notice, guarantees no continued coverage and puts the burden on providers. For most, it offered no real protection.
Patients were warned months in advance that coverage could change, but notices came with no transition plan, hotline or clear options. Many expected a deal. When it didn’t come, they were left stranded and confused. Patients called in panic and waited on hold for hours. Clinics were overwhelmed. Nurses and front-desk staff bore the brunt.
One caregiver told lawmakers: “We thought someone would step in before it happened. We did not think we would be left to figure it out alone.”
As the crisis unfolded, public pressure mounted.
At a June 30 Missouri Senate hearing, MU Health’s CEO accused Anthem of refusing to negotiate in good faith. Anthem countered that it had offered temporary continuity-of-care extensions, which MU declined.
Labor unions condemned Anthem’s actions as morally unacceptable and launched town halls and petitions calling for resolution. Meanwhile, community clinics like Spectrum Health reported a 30% surge in Anthem patients, with appointment slots booked months out.
By late June, MU Health had reassigned more than 30 staff to handle Anthem-related claim backlogs. Anthem made two continuity-of-care offers, including one extending coverage through Dec. 31. MU declined both proposals, citing confusion, lack of clarity and inadequate patient protections.
MU later described the plans as unacceptable. The focus turned to liability and leverage, not those left without access.
Anthem, University of Missouri reach agreement on health care coverage

The two sides finally reached a new agreement on July 15, restoring in-network coverage for most commercial and ACA plans, retroactive to April 1. But patients on Anthem Medicare Advantage HMO and PPO plans were excluded.
For many, the harm had already been done.
Missouri law allows patients in active treatment to request up to 90 days of continued in-network cost sharing when a contract ends. But it doesn’t require insurers to notify patients or providers to explain the option. It has no enforcement mechanism, no appeals process and no agency tasked with oversight. By late June, up to 1,000 patients were reportedly still awaiting eligibility determinations under the law.
Many patients don’t learn the law exists until it’s too late. Even when it applies, providers must initiate the request and negotiate coverage. Many plans are excluded. The law doesn’t define “active treatment” and offers no guarantee of care.
During the Missouri Senate hearing in June, representatives from MU Health Care and Anthem testified about breakdowns in continuity‑of‑care provisions. They described fragmented communication and patients experiencing access disruptions mid‑treatment, though no regulators from the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance appeared or testified on enforcement authority.
A 2024 survey by the American Medical Association found that 94% of physicians said prior authorization delays care. Seventy-eight percent said it often leads patients to abandon treatment. Nearly one in four said it caused serious harm, including hospitalization or permanent disability.
These delays strain patients and providers alike. Clinics lose revenue and staff time. Families face worsening conditions, higher bills and longer recoveries. When coverage is pulled mid-treatment, patients walk away, providers lose trust and hospitals absorb the debt.
Missouri’s hospitals, especially in rural areas, already operate under chronic strain.
Other states have done more.
California allows continued care for up to 12 months. Colorado guarantees 90 days and requires 60 days’ notice. New York and Texas extend protections through pregnancy, terminal illness and emergencies, with clear billing safeguards. These laws reduce surprise billing, readmissions, and costly treatment gaps. They show what meaningful continuity looks like.
Missouri has chosen not to follow suit.
This was preventable harm. Those with the fewest options paid the highest price.
People managing cancer, pregnancy, disability or recovery from surgery were told to find new doctors, restart referrals and reschedule care. Some paid out of pocket. Others gave up treatment entirely.
Some patients were able to continue treatment. Others were dropped, billed unexpectedly or denied access entirely. Many were left navigating a maze of denials and billing codes with no clear guidance.
Despite public statements, financial disclosures tell a different story.
MU Health requested a 20 to 30% increase in reimbursement over three years, citing rising costs and a need to match peer academic systems. Anthem offered only a 3.3% increase and called it final. MU still posted a $53.5 million operating gain in early 2025. But Anthem’s parent company, Elevance Health, reported a $3.2 billion quarterly operating gain and spent $880 million on stock buybacks that same quarter.
While patients waited on hold to reschedule chemotherapy, Anthem spent nearly $1 billion on buybacks. The resources were there. The leverage to protect continuity existed. But the burden fell on those already vulnerable.
Insurers and some lawmakers argue that stronger continuity laws would raise costs or create bureaucracy. But the real burden is not on them. It is on patients. Missouri law allows insurers to end coverage without advance notice, clear explanation, or state oversight. No agency enforces patient protections.
When care is disrupted, patients must make calls, restart treatment, or go without.
Lawmakers must act. Missouri should:

Require 30 days’ notice before removing providers from networks
Extend continuity-of-care protections to at least six months
Mandate public reporting of provider terminations and affected patients
Create a standardized appeals process with clear timelines and enforcement
Empower state agencies to issue emergency orders during major disruptions

These reforms aren’t radical. Other states already have them. They work. They protect patients.
Health insurance must be more than a product. It must be a promise.
When access disappears mid-treatment, that promise is broken.
If Missouri claims to protect the insured, it must also protect the treated.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stethoscope-chart-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-08-05 06:56:27.909671

Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”

The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive



Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
 Undermining ERIC

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
 ‘A total shock’

In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Particularly the ones that are opaque at best, and deceptive at worst, in their snail mail. As public concerns mount about dwindling Social Security reserves, these mailers may be flying into senior Virginians’ mailboxes more frequently. 
Grandma, who’s 92 and lives with The Boss and me, recently received three cash solicitations within a week regarding the solvency of Social Security. We’d never heard of the senders before, and we surmised their monikers could confuse folks about their bona fides.
They all begged for money and signatures, as one missive termed it, to help bolster “the payment of Social Security benefits well into the future.” That letter assigned my mother-in-law a registration number – how official! – as part of advocating for a Social Security guarantee. (No sender, for example, was nearly as recognizable as AARP, the nonprofit that’s been around since 1958 and says it fights for the priorities of everyone age 50 and over.)
Among the warnings from the National Campaign to Guarantee Social Security, which is a project of the Federation of Responsible Citizens: “There is no greater economic crisis facing our nation than the impending crash of Social Security.” I’ll spare you the pages of ALL CAPS from the letter.
There are some nuggets of truth about the claims regarding Social Security, but they’re missing vital context. Nor is there proof that these solicitors can deliver.
Similar letters arrived from the American Federation of Senior Citizens, another project of the FRC (why do you need two Social Security projects from the same umbrella group?) and the Senior Citizen Association of America, part of the National Senior Citizen Committee.
The latter sought a signature for an enclosed Social Security amendment petition … and a contribution. 
Red flags immediately went up for my wife and me. They should for you, too, especially if you have an aging parent inundated with these come-ons, or are musing about forking over cash to such sketchy outfits.
“Unsolicited mail asking for money, especially with urgent or emotional appeals, should be treated with caution,” a Social Security Administration spokesperson told me by email Thursday. Roughly 68 million people received some form of Social Security benefits at the end of 2024.
The agency “encourages the public to not send money or personal information until they have verified the organization’s legitimacy,” the spokesperson said.
Such solicitations might be from 501(c)(4) nonprofit groups that indeed exist, but they might have marginal clout. They are lobbying groups in which donors can’t deduct money for federal income tax purposes. Both FRC and the NSCC fall into that category.
Are benefactors merely enriching the employees and board members of these organizations?
I’m betting the letters arrived so closely together because the program’s viability was the subject of news articles this summer. The trust funds for Social Security and Medicare will run out of money in less than a decade, according to a report, and the programs’ trustees warned that the funds’ depletion date is closer than predicted a year ago, The Washington Post noted.
If Congress doesn’t overhaul the programs’ financing, automatic cuts will slash Social Security benefits by 23%  and Medicare hospital benefits by 11%  in 2033.
However, there’s a huge caveat, The Post said in its June 18 primer: Decreasing benefits “would be so unpopular that Congress would face great pressure to act.” That’s correct.
“Lawmakers would probably need to consider a mix of benefit cuts plus new revenue — such as higher taxes to fund Social Security, perhaps taxing wages above the current threshold of $176,100,” the article continued.
Because retirees are such a dependable, consistent voting bloc, craven Congressional members who have delayed tackling the problem for ages would feel the weight of self-preservation – and finally do something.
Spokespersons for both of Virginia’s senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, told me they hadn’t received complaints from constituents about the solicitors I’d mentioned.
I phoned and emailed officials at FRC and NSCC. I asked about their purported value, what percentage of their donations goes to actual lobbying, and more. My messages weren’t returned.
That left me to seek out financial documents online, the groups’ websites, and message boards that mentioned the organizations – usually negatively by family members of letter recipients.
Charity Navigator, which rates nearly a quarter-million nonprofits, says the FRC got its IRS ruling as a 501(c)(4) in 1990. But the ratings organization doesn’t cover such lobbying groups in detail. FRC is based in Alexandria, Virginia.
The ratings group said the NSCC gained its IRS ruling in 2010, but it’s also a 501(c)(4). It’s based in Reston, Virginia.
The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which monitors charitable groups seeking donations in the commonwealth, said the FRC and NSCC register with it annually. It had no records of complaints related to organization names that I’d provided.
ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom, said FRC had $12.4 million in revenues and slightly less in expenses on Form 990 for 2023. The only executive compensation was $60,000 for Denise Singleton, listed as president/director. Professional fundraising fees were $530,600, or 4.3% of total expenses.
You don’t find out much about FRC on its website. Click on “accomplishments,” and it touts activities it completed in 2018.
ProPublica reports the NSSC had $2.5 million in revenues and nearly $2.7 million in expenses for 2023. It listed no money for employee compensation. It showed $400,000 in professional fundraising fees, or 15% of total expenses. David M. Coyne, listed as a director, signed the letter to my mother-in-law.
I interviewed Linda Benesch, spokeswoman for Social Security Works, an organization cited in news articles on the federal program. She said she follows Social Security stories in the news media and can’t recall the groups I was writing about ever being quoted or mentioned.
“They aren’t members of the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, which brings together the major organizations that advocate for seniors,” she added, by email. The council has more than 60 organizations, including hers.
I asked Benesch why even donate to such nonprofits, since our individual House and Senate members should be fighting for us – without having to pay them extra.
“I think there’s a place for both calling your members of Congress directly and supporting advocacy organizations that have capacity to build direct relationships with members of Congress,” Benesch said. “However, people should always do their research before donating.”
On the latter, we agree.
Our U.S. representatives and senators are there for a reason. If you’d like to also donate to nonprofits fighting for Social Security, make sure they’re legit and effective.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)As Pennsylvania finds itself in its sixth week without a finalized state budget for fiscal year 2025-2026, counties across the commonwealth are growing increasingly concerned about the consequences of continued delay. 
Without an enacted budget and corresponding code bills, the state is unable to release money for many of its core obligations – including the human services counties are required to deliver on its behalf.
Counties are now bracing for missed payments that fund essential programs such as mental and behavioral health services, child protective services, intellectual disability support, drug and alcohol treatment, and assistance for individuals experiencing homelessness. These programs form the foundation of Pennsylvania’s human services safety net, and state funding is not a luxury – it’s essential to keeping programs operational and responsive to community needs.
Budget Secretary Uri Monson issued a formal communication to counties regarding the ongoing state budget impasse, outlining the impact of delayed payments from key Health and Human Services departments over the next six weeks. 
The figures shared are deeply concerning, as the inability to finalize a state budget is preventing the distribution of hundreds of million of dollars to support county-administered human services.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Alarming funding delays for counties include:

$15 million in quarterly advances for Behavioral Health Services
$390 million in County Child Welfare payments 
$3.5 million in quarterly advances from the Human Services Development Fund
$12.88 million in payments to Area Agencies on Aging 
$9.95 million in quarterly payments to Single County Authorities 

As counties are legally required to deliver these critical services on behalf of the commonwealth, the absence of funding for July and August places a severe burden on their ability to operate.  This ongoing uncertainty not only disrupts local operations but threatens the stability of services relied upon by the more vulnerable Pennsylvanians – all while the budget remains unresolved. 
While this is not Pennsylvania’s first budget impasse, the burden on counties has only deepened with each occurrence. During the 2015 impasse, which lasted more than nine months, counties were forced to take extraordinary and unsustainable measures: redirecting local property tax revenue to backfill state dollars, suspending payments to providers, scaling back or eliminating services, instituting hiring freezes and staff layoffs, and securing lines of credit or tax anticipation notes to maintain cash flow.
These short-term solutions had lasting financial consequences. 
Counties tapped reserves, deferred expenditures, and in some cases raised taxes to stay afloat. Many incurred increased borrowing costs and credit downgrades. The repercussions continue to be felt today in the form of elevated interest rates on current and future borrowing.
For over a decade, counties have been asked to do more with less, stretching flat or declining state funding to meet rising costs and expanding responsibilities. Without timely payments, counties may be forced to freeze spending, postpone contracts, or borrow funds just to keep services afloat. 
These measures place added pressure on local taxpayers and jeopardize the continuity of care for those most in need.

Counties are calling on the General Assembly and the Administration to finalize the state budget without further delay so that critical funding can resume. 
Moreover, counties support efforts to enact long-term solutions that prevent this crisis from recurring. One is example is House Bill 1609, sponsored by Rep. Marla Brown (R-Lawrence). It offers a critical safeguard by ensuring that core human services, such as medical assistance, child welfare, mental health care and substance use treatment, continue to receive funding during the impasse. 
What’s at stake is more than just a timeline – it’s the ability of counties to fulfill their legal obligations, respond to those in crisis, and ensure the safety and stability of our communities. 
A timely and reliable state budget is not just a matter of governance; it’s a fundamental commitment to the well-being and dignity of Pennsylvanians.

At the nearly 3,000-acre First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach, people can traverse trails meandering through landscapes of forest, swamp and beach.
But many visitors don’t stop to think about the forces that shaped the land beneath, said geologist Rich Whittecar, an emeritus professor at Old Dominion University.
Whittecar has made it his mission to learn more about the geological history of the Cape Henry area, including the state park.
The land is marked by a series of sandy ridges extending toward the coast in a sort of corduroy pattern. Whittecar wanted to know more about how and when they formed.
After years of fieldwork, his team recently found out the answer: These sand dunes began appearing about 5,000 years ago, carved by erosion and sea level rise from melting glaciers after the last ice age ended around 11,000 years ago.
“When the oldest ridges were forming here, it was about 500 years before the Egyptians started building the big pyramids,” Whittecar said.
The researchers are working to finalize a formal paper by the end of the year. They say the new information about Virginia Beach’s northernmost point can not only shed light on its past, but also offer a window into its future amid rapid climate change.
“I hope people can put together some more of a long-term picture of what is happening here,” Whittecar said.
His initial fascination with Cape Henry stretches back decades, when he tagged along on a soil survey as a young professor.

At the time it was hard to date the dunes because researchers used radiocarbon dating, which relies on organic material that is not as common in sand. Scientific advances now allow for a different process, called optically stimulated luminescence.
A few years ago, Whittecar’s “squad of graduate students” began digging up sand dunes at 11 sites throughout First Landing State Park, reaching about 6 feet underground to find material long buried by time.
“We needed to come out and dig a hole big enough to get my body down into this and pound a tube into the side,” he said.
They wrapped sand samples in aluminum foil to shield them from outside light and sent them to a lab for the luminescence method.
Lab technicians peer into trillions of atoms in a grain of sand, looking for evidence of ionizing radiation that sand absorbs as it decays under new layers.
By measuring the crystal structure of these particles, scientists determine the amount of time that’s passed since the sample last saw the light of day.

The age of the ridges at First Landing ranges from 5,000 years along the south side, near Linkhorn Bay, and gradually decreases as they stretch closer to the coastline. The newest crest, around the campground, is only 125 years old.
There are several types of dunes in the area, Whittecar said. Most are “low, long, continuous, skinny ridges,” which formed over a long period of time.
Some jut up more irregularly, reaching about 30 feet in height.
“The big, tall, knobby ridges are ones that we’re pretty sure happened when the ocean was cutting back and eroding into the beach,” he said. “As it did that, it kicked up a lot of more sand, and that sand blew back and formed the ridges behind it.”
The trails people travel around the state park are largely those tall, knobby dunes.
Finally, there are larger, 100-foot dunes that formed much later around Fort Story and became prominent to early navigators in the Colonial era.
“As the ships would come up and see these big, tall dunes at Cape Henry, they’d say, ‘Oh, this is where you turn and go into the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay,’” Whittecar said.

Professor Tom Allen, chair of ODU’s department of political science and geography, got involved to help build a precise digital map of the area.
He used lidar, a laser-based aerial surveillance technique, to “basically paint the ground with elevation points” and identify the shape and size of the dunes.
Looking at these data points is like looking at the rings of a tree trunk, he said, with signals embedded that could point to evidence of storms or erosion.
Allen said those historic patterns can help officials determine what might happen next, as climate conditions continue to change.
“The better we can understand Cape Henry, the better we can predict and manage what we have,” he said. “It’s all trending to natural curiosity. But also, there’s a kind of stewardship, and inherent beauty in understanding the environment here.”

(Getty Images)Virginia parents, like parents everywhere, strive to plan for their children’s futures. One Virginia politician is proposing a new way for them to do that, with a plan he says will ensure children born and raised in the commonwealth get financial support for their education and positioned to buy their own homes down the road, funded partially by the state’s booming data center industry. 
In a video posted to X last week, Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, suggested creating opportunity accounts for Virginia children that would start out with a $1000 deposit from the state.  The state would then add an additional $100 a month until the child is 18. That would lead to about $50,000 being set aside for young Virginians to use towards education or housing. Thomas framed opportunity accounts as similar to 529 education savings plans.
The idea is also similar to the recently passed pilot program from the Trump Administration in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would put $1,000 into accounts for American children that go into low-cost stock investments and then parents may add to the account if they want to. Thomas said not every family can afford to contribute to those accounts and many families are looking for new ways to save money and invest in their children.
“So why not create a program that dives directly to the number one pain point for Americans and Virginians, which is the cost of living,” Thomas said. “It would set up every new adult to be able to either mostly or significantly fund education or completely cover the down payment on a starter home.”
The way Thomas proposed to pay for the accounts is, in part, through state tax revenue from data centers. Over a third of the world’s data centers are housed in Virginia and currently the state provides a significant tax exemption that entices the companies to build their facilities in the commonwealth.
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission reported the state gave companies a $928-million tax break in fiscal year 2023. Local governments are able to reap the tax revenue rewards while the state is under the current tax incentives that exempt the centers from sales and use taxes that are set to expire in 2035. Data centers are eligible to be exempt from the state sales and use tax for certain computer equipment and software that is purchased or leased if they meet certain investment and job creation standards.
“I’m just someone who has always pushed for data centers to pay their fair share, I think that fair share is in the form of alleviating the pain that ratepayers are going to pick up for more grid infrastructure to support data centers,” Thomas said. “I think it’s also in the rates that they’re gonna pay for just more energy usage and construction as well.”
A new deal or extension of the tax breaks will have to be negotiated years before the sunset is anticipated. Thomas said the entirety of the tax break wouldn’t go away but some of the money they generate for the state could be used to invest in Virginia’s children in a new way. 
“I think a policy like opportunity accounts is the type of creativity that Americans and Virginians are demanding from the Democratic party and so I would love to see something like that happen in Virginia,” Thomas said.
The accounts would only be for children who are born and remain in Virginia until they are 18. If a family moves out of the state then the money is routed back into the fund and the child misses out on the money, Thomas said.
Thomas is in preliminary discussions with fellow lawmakers on where else the money for the opportunity accounts could come from. Should he move forward with the idea it would be filed as a bill for the 2026 General Assembly session that begins in January.

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.
When Jasmin Belanger agreed to a plan to pay $750 in back rent, she had no idea how the decision would haunt her.
It wasn’t until 10 months later, while apartment hunting to distance herself from an ex-boyfriend she said had abused her, that she discovered an eviction on her record. She hadn’t ever been ordered to move out, having paid her back rent on schedule. But it turned out that the 2023 deal she made in court with her landlord to help her avoid eviction created a paper record that made it look like she had been evicted. That black mark kept her from finding a new place to live.
Belanger’s landlord was the Bangor public housing authority, which operates apartments for low-income residents. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development strongly encourages public housing authorities to offer so-called repayment agreements to tenants who have fallen behind on rent in order to help them stay in their homes. It recommends that authorities reach these deals before cases reach eviction court.
But housing authorities have flexibility as to how to design and enforce such agreements. And the way these second-chance opportunities are executed in some parts of Maine — verbally in eviction courts with little judicial oversight — has come back to harm even tenants who meet every term of their deals.
That’s because judges here don’t pause eviction cases even when tenants and housing authorities reach agreements. In fact, those judges often grant landlords possession of properties at the time that repayment deals are made — expediting the process of kicking out tenants who violate the agreements.
Some states have taken steps to prevent this, requiring landlords to return to court to evict tenants who don’t fulfill the terms of their repayment plans. Housing authorities also could choose to pause or close eviction cases if repayment agreements are made in court, but they rarely do so in Maine, said Erica Veazey, an attorney with Pine Tree Legal Assistance, a legal aid group based in Portland that represents low-income tenants throughout the state.
Most housing authorities in Maine, including Bangor’s, told the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica that they follow HUD’s guidance and try to reach agreements with tenants outside of courts. But court records show that’s not always true in Bangor, the state’s second-largest housing authority. There, 54 tenants had repayment agreements made in court, according to the newsrooms’ examination of eviction filings between 2019 and 2024. All 54 tenants ended up with eviction judgments in court records, including those who may have repaid their debts. (If a repayment agreement was made outside of court, it would not appear in any official record.)
Maine’s court system is one of the last in the country to rely on paper records, making a holistic accounting of such ghost evictions difficult. But the Bangor cases show for the first time how these repayment agreements can backfire for tenants against the intent of the HUD guidance.
Presented with these findings, Mike Myatt, executive director of Bangor’s housing authority, said he did not know public housing residents would automatically end up with evictions on their records if they entered into repayment agreements in court.
“I don’t quite understand or know how those processes may be changed,” Myatt said, “but we would certainly lead an effort or be part of an effort that would change those rules.”

HUD, during President Donald Trump’s first term, began urging housing authorities to reach repayment agreements before taking tenants to eviction court in July 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. In January, just before President Joe Biden left office, the agency reemphasized that guidance as part of new safeguards for public housing tenants; that doesn’t include a recommendation about whether evictions should be included on tenants’ records as part of such deals.
“HUD’s intent seems pretty clear: Eviction filing should be a last resort for housing authorities and not essentially a way to strong-arm tenants into agreeing to whatever terms you want to put them under,” said Hannah Adams, a senior attorney at the National Housing Law Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy center for low-income tenants and homeowners. She practices in Louisiana, where judges regularly sign off on repayment agreements without entering an eviction judgment. 
Of the more than three dozen tenants contacted by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica, only Belanger agreed to publicly share her experience about the consequences of having an eviction on her record.
An eviction, even one that never actually happened, can haunt a person’s financial record for years, visible to lenders and prospective landlords and hurting opportunities to obtain credit or rent a home, Adams said.
Asked to comment on a range of questions, including the effect of housing authorities deviating from federal guidance, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett issued a statement saying the Trump administration is reviewing all rules finalized during the last administration.
“Many artificially raised the cost of housing and administration of HUD programs,” Lovett said. “HUD is looking into this specific rule and considering necessary options to revise or remove this burden.”
The agency did not respond to follow-up questions about whether or how it would revise the guidance about repayment agreements.
Perils of court-based deals
Belanger said she fell behind on her rent in 2023 because she was paying to stay at a hotel to live away from her ex. She had also lost income because she was no longer showing up regularly to her cosmetology job due to the stress.
An eviction notice delivered to her door in May 2023 prompted her to meet with a financial counselor at the Bangor housing authority. The counselor advised her to seek a repayment plan in order to remain in her apartment and avoid eviction court, Belanger said. But the housing authority initially refused, telling her that she could only get a repayment plan in court, according to a text message from a housing authority representative to Belanger. The text message appears to contradict Myatt’s characterization of his agency’s standard practice.
Myatt would not explain why Belanger was not allowed to enter into an agreement before court, saying he could not speak about individual eviction cases even with Belanger’s permission.
“Every eviction case is unique and has different circumstances,” he said. “We go above and beyond to help people stay in their housing.”
When her court date arrived two months later in July, Belanger said the process moved quickly. The judge called her name, and she was ushered to a conference room off the courthouse hallway where the housing authority’s attorney, Joseph Bethony, verbally offered her a deal: She could remain in her apartment if she paid her back rent. She said he never mentioned anything about an eviction going on her record. Bethony declined to comment, referring the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica to Myatt. There is no guidance on what housing authority attorneys are supposed to tell tenants when making repayment agreements, Myatt said.
“Our goal is to keep families housed and collect the very important rent we need to pay our expenses,” Myatt said. “Our counsel works with everyone to accomplish that goal.”
Belanger, who did not have an attorney, said she agreed to the repayment plan without seeing it in writing.

She returned to the courtroom, where a judge asked if she had reached an agreement with the housing authority. She responded yes and the hearing ended, Belanger said. She believed the deal had been simple: Pay what she owed, make the payments on time and the housing authority would let her stay.
The repayment agreements are drawn up by attorneys for the housing authority and are not typically reviewed by judges, according to Barbara Cardone, a spokesperson for the Maine Judicial Branch. Cardone said the court’s authority in eviction cases is limited to determining whether the landlord can take possession of the property.
The housing authority said it does not give tenants the agreements to sign in court. After the hearing, the agency sends a letter to the tenant outlining the repayment agreement and terms of the court ruling. Myatt said he does not review the agreements.
The copy of the agreement that Belanger eventually received was dated seven days after the court hearing and was signed by Bethony but not Belanger, according to the document reviewed by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica. The one-page document said Belanger had agreed that the judge ruled in favor of the housing authority, which would have the power to immediately evict her if she does not pay her rent — and back rent — on time over the next year.
She would not understand the implications until March 2024, while trying to move away from her ex, when a prospective landlord informed her she would not get the apartment because an eviction judgment had been entered against her in court. Belanger even had a reference letter from the housing authority saying that she had fulfilled her repayment agreement and her previous struggles paying rent “were due to the monies she has had to spend staying away from her apartment to be safe,” according to an email reviewed by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica.
“I had paid off all of my debt,” Belanger said in an interview. “I would have fought this if I had known this was a consequence.”
Myatt, head of the Bangor housing authority, said he trains his staff to use court-based agreements as a last resort. He said tenants should not be punished with eviction records if they’ve fulfilled their agreements.
“If the obligations are met,” he said, “the eviction should be lifted.” There is currently no way to expunge an eviction record in Maine.

Unlike in Maine, other places across the country have set up more guardrails around repayment agreements and evictions. Massachusetts requires all repayment agreements made in court to be in writing and approved by judicial officials. In addition, landlords can’t automatically evict tenants who don’t abide by their agreements; they must return to court to prove tenants did not uphold their side of the deals before obtaining enforceable eviction orders.
In SeaTac, a Seattle suburb, local ordinances require eviction proceedings to stop in court if a tenant and landlord agree to a repayment agreement, so tenants do not wind up with evictions on their records. In Portland, Oregon, the public housing authority allows residents to sign repayment agreements at any point before eviction hearings.
Nicole Summers, an associate professor at Georgetown Law who has extensively studied eviction settlements, refers to repayment agreements as “civil probation.” That’s because these agreements often include rules and conditions governing tenants’ behavior well beyond paying off back rent.
In Maine, Veazey said that under some agreements, violating public housing rules by failing to mow your lawn or smoking too close to the building can lead to a tenant’s forced removal without having to return to court for an eviction order.
In Presque Isle, the housing authority gave a public housing resident 48 hours to pack up and leave after she missed a rent payment. The woman, featured in a story by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica in December, was homeless for three years after violating the repayment plan she had made in court. When there is no repayment agreement in place, landlords normally must provide tenants 30 days’ notice for most lease violations before filing eviction cases in court.
Belanger’s agreement in Bangor featured a similar trigger for eviction. She wasn’t just required to pay what she owed, she also had to make future rent payments on time for 12 months.
In the two years since Belanger agreed to the repayment deal in court, she said she has felt trapped.
Despite a positive reference from the Bangor housing authority’s director of property management, landlord after landlord rejected her rental application because of the eviction. It took the single mother of a toddler nine months to get into another apartment far away from her ex, who was out on bail after being arrested for allegedly beating and threatening to kill her. (He was later found not guilty after a trial.)
Belanger said she’s afraid to move again because the paper eviction hasn’t gone away.
“I’m probably still going to have this hassle coming along with me wherever I go.”

President Donald Trump’s phaseout of clean energy tax credits will make solar and wind projects more expensive, but some states are still committed to clean energy mandates. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.











We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce



“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
A slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
Trump aims to shut down state climate policies

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore referred a DOJ request to participate in a call about information sharing to the Office of Attorney General Peter Neronha, which in turn emailed the DOJ to ask for more details.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
 Undermining ERIC

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
Why Republican-led states keep leaving a group that verifies voter rolls

“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”

The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

She says maintaining Medicaid benefits is already highly complicated. New work requirements will makes things much worse, she said. (Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.) People pushing cuts to the safety net in Ohio and nationally say they want to stop freeloading and waste. Ohioan Tarrezz Thompson does everything those people say they want. 
She owns a small business, teaching small children with learning disabilities who mostly come from low-income families. She’s helping herself and her family by giving those kids and their families a hand up. 
But Thompson, a mother of six and the recipient of a kidney transplant, said maintaining health and other benefits is a confusing, arbitrary process already. 
She warns that with budget cuts and new state and federal work requirements, many families will be forced from the system — not because they don’t want to work, but because the hassle will make maintaining benefits virtually impossible.
And that, she said, will only compound the problems that drove people to need help in the first place.
Thompson, who works with the Ohio Organizing Collaborative’s Care Economy Project, said that the families she works with have a take-what-comes attitude, but many don’t appreciate what’s about to hit.
“Most families are aware of what’s coming down the pike,” she said. “They’re operating out of their own post-covid trauma and they’re like, ‘we’ll figure it out when we get there.’ I tell them, you aren’t in a position to provide medical care for your children. That’s a lot of money. Without insurance, it’s even more.” 
 Disruption

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will slash nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years. Those cuts include about $33 billion in Ohio, according to estimates KFF released late last month. It will slash another $230 billion in federal food assistance over the same period. 
KFF estimates that most of Medicaid savings will be achieved through attrition caused by work requirements.
Those rules will take effect at the start of 2027. Many of the SNAP work requirements took effect the day Trump signed the bill.
While making unprecedented cuts to programs for the poorest Americans, the law gives $1 trillion in tax cuts to the richest 1%. It also balloons the deficit by $3.4 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine has requested permission from federal authorities to impose state work requirements on the 770,000 residents who are enrolled as part of the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The feds haven’t ruled on that request.
The work requirements come even though 92% of non-disabled Medicaid recipients under 65 are either working, or couldn’t due to caregiving responsibilities, or were ill, or in school. 
They also come despite the fact that work requirements implemented in Arkansas in 2018 increased the number of the uninsured, while having no effect on employment. 
Real people

Thompson said it can be bewildering to try to work and maintain benefits even without the new requirements. 
Her youngest child is disabled, and he and the rest of her kids who are still minors qualify for traditional Medicaid. But Thompson said she keeps getting bounced around between traditional Medicaid, the expansion group, and a changing methodology to consider her eligibility.
“What I’ve been experiencing this year is they keep moving me from what program is covering my Medicaid,” she said, explaining that in the past month alone, she received three notifications that she’d been moved from one program to another. 
“I got moved from Medicaid to the Medicaid Adjusted Gross Income program. It’s supposed to be for individuals without children.”
The Morrow County Job and Family Services website gives a flavor of how hard to understand the rules can be when it tries to explain Medicaid Adjusted Gross Income Program, or MAGI, rules:
“Will MAGI rules apply to everyone seeking Medicaid coverage?” it asks in a Q&A. 
“MAGI-Based Eligibility applies to individuals who are considered Covered Families and Children (CFC) Medicaid categories including families, children up to age 19, pregnant women, and adults 19 – 64 who are below 138% Federal Poverty Level (FPL),” it says. “MAGI rules also apply to time-limited coverage for individuals who were enrolled in Medicaid’s parent category and lost eligibility due to increased earnings or spousal support.”
What the many changes have meant for Thompson are doctor visits in which she thought she was covered, but then told that she was not. 
She also needs to take prescription drugs and have regular lab work because of her kidney transplant. Repeated changes have resulted in coverage denials totaling about $1,000 that she can’t pay. 
On top of being a mother and running a business on a shoestring, she has to deal with that as well.
“It’s a bureaucratic nightmare,” she said. “I don’t know that the changes happened. I go to my doctors. They tell me my coverage has ended and then I have to restart the cycle to find out how to get their services covered. I currently have four medical bills that I’m trying to resolve. They were actually covered, but when they submitted them, they got denied for non-coverage.”
Thompson has tried to get health coverage in the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, but she kept getting denied when it was determined that she was eligible for Medicaid.
“It’s pretty stressful,” said Thompson, whose calm outward demeanor belies her stress. “My cortisol level is really high.”
Double whammy, widespread pain
When the new bureaucracy and funding cuts kick in, Thompson is unlikely to get much relief.
She said she was worried about how the changes might affect her son, who starts college in the fall and will turn 18 just a month later. And she worries about how they would affect her business, because most of her students’ families are on Medicaid and other assistance as well.
“What’s scary to me is that all these changes in some way, shape, or form are going to touch me,” Thompson said.
When families lose housing, food assistance, or health care, they become destabilized, she said.
“What happens is they move wherever they need to go to get that stability,” she said. “Many families have moved out of my service zone or even out of the state, so I lose revenue. That puts my program in crisis mode because I still have to pay expenses to maintain the program.”
Thompson is far from alone. 
In a state where more than 25% of people are on Medicaid, such destabilization threatens to become commonplace — or at least, more commonplace.
She described what happened to the family of one of her clients during the covid pandemic.
“There was a grandmother, a mother, three daughters, and an adopted child living in a house,” Thompson said. “The mother, the grandmother, and one of the daughters were working, and the mother was handling all of the bills.” 
She fell behind on rent and got an eviction notice. 
“They were scrambling to come up with $2,500 on a place that was costing them $500 a month,” Thompson said, explaining that the amounts might not seem like much, but for people in such situations, it’s an impossible amount.

On the one hand, Ayotte signed bipartisan legislation to require that all cities and towns provide accessible voting machines at local elections — not just those with state and federal candidates.
On the other, Ayotte also approved a bill that would include more documentation requirements for absentee voters. 
Republicans and other supporters of that bill say the new registration requirements bring in needed oversight in New Hampshire’s elections, and make absentee voters face the same process as in-person voters. Disability rights groups say they could be difficult for some to comply with and could discourage them from voting.
The absentee bills represent the latest in a series of changes to New Hampshire’s voting laws that have made them more restrictive. Most significantly, in 2024, Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law requiring new voters to show documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, making New Hampshire voter registration the strictest in the country. Legal groups have filed two separate federal lawsuits against that law, House Bill 1569. 
Stricter absentee voting procedures
Ayotte’s signing of Senate Bill 218, adding tighter requirements for absentee voter registration, helped Republicans follow through on a multi-year goal concerning voter verification. 
The new law requires that absentee voters submit documents indicating citizenship, age, domicile, and identity when they fill in the affidavit allowing them to register to vote. 
To Rep. Ross Berry, a Weare Republican and the chairman of the House Election Law Committee, the new law is meant to align the documentary requirements for absentee voter registration with the new documentary requirements for in-person voting. 
Those in-person requirements — which mandate that new voters produce a birth certificate, passport, or other document to prove citizenship — took effect a week after the 2024 general election. 
“The laws for voting by absentee ballot should be as close to voting in person as possible, and SB 218 is a major step toward accomplishing that,” Berry said in a statement Friday. “This is a big win for boosting faith in the outcome of New Hampshire elections.”
Democrats and voting rights groups have denounced the 2024 in-person registration requirements, and now say the 2025 extension will only make it more difficult for absentee voters, and voters with disabilities, to vote.
They have pointed to the 2025 town meeting season — the most widespread test of the in-person version of the proof-of-citizenship bill — as evidence that the law could stop qualified people from voting because they do not have easy access to a passport or birth certificate. At least 96 people were turned away from the polls across the state this spring because they did not have the proper documents to demonstrate citizenship, according to a tally by the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, a subsidiary of America Votes. 
“Our office is concerned about legislation that would make it more difficult (to vote),” said Karen Rosenberg, policy director at the Disability Rights Center New Hampshire, in an interview Monday. “And I hope that people will figure out work arounds and ways to get what they need to vote, but I think it’s going to be very challenging.” 
Disability voting machines now standard
In contrast to SB 218, Ayotte’s signing of a bill to require the provision of accessible voting machines in all New Hampshire elections — both local and statewide — has represented a bipartisan victory for many.
“This is sort of one of the few, if any, feel-good bills of the year,” said Rep. Mark Paige, an Exeter Democrat who has helped spearhead the law.
The new law, passed via House Bill 67, addresses a longstanding discrepancy. Under federal law, New Hampshire’s Secretary of State’s Office must own and operate those accessible machines, which allow voters with vision impairments and other disabilities to use a keyboard and audio cues to fill in and print out a ballot.  
But while federal law requires that those machines be available in all elections with federal candidates, it does not require the same for elections that are fully local, such as town meetings, annual school meetings, municipal elections, or special elections for the state House and Senate. Accordingly, for years, the Secretary of State’s Office did not supply cities and towns the machines for local elections, and most towns did not have them. 
This month’s law requires that all towns provide machines and also requires that the Secretary of State’s Office enter into agreements with all cities and towns in order to provide those machines.
The law comes a year after legislators passed a pilot program in which the Secretary of State’s Office began lending out its existing machines for the 2025 town meeting season. That practice will now continue. 
The law also comes after Concord and Exeter recently volunteered to buy the machines after facing legal challenges under the Americans with Disabilities Act, serving as a warning to other towns. 
Now, under the new law, cities and towns will not need to pay to buy or use the state’s voting machines. They will only be on the hook for the cost to hire a vendor to program those machines to work with the ballots in their local elections — such as the town meeting warrant ballot — a service that might cost between $600 and $850 per machine per election, according to guidance from the Secretary of State’s Office. 
“Not a huge cost when you consider that on July 4, when they do fireworks, they’re going to eat up $1,200 in about 10 seconds,” said Rosenberg.
Speaking on the cost, Paige said it was well worth it for voters who needed the machines. The alternative for them, he noted, could mean having to tell a pollworker who they are voting for in order to receive assistance filling out a ballot. “I guess the question is how much is your secret ballot worth?” Paige said. 
Rosenberg said the new requirements will bring needed continuity for people with disabilities.
“If you moved from Manchester to Concord to Plymouth to wherever, you’re going to use the same machines and they’re going to be properly vetted by the Secretary of State’s Office,” she said. 
In addition to signing the bill requiring the availability of the machines, Ayotte vetoed a bill last week that would create exemptions to that requirement. House Bill 613 would allow cities and towns to choose to not offer the accessible machines if no voter had specifically requested to use the machine in writing at least 60 days before Election Day. 
Berry and other Republicans had argued HB 613 would allow small towns, particularly those in the North Country, to save on programming costs if no voters appeared interested in using the machines. 
“While I would have liked to see the small-town protections in HB 613 signed into law, this does not diminish the fact that today New Hampshire is taking a big step forward in increasing access to local ballots with HB 67” he said. “Increasing turnout for local elections will be a high priority going into the next session, and that includes expanding access for disabled voters.”
But Rosenberg and other advocates had argued that bill would be unconstitutional because it would allow towns and cities to treat voters with disabilities differently from voters without disabilities. They also said it would be unfair to voters with disabilities who moved to a town within 60 days of Election Day and could not request a machine because the deadline had passed. 
In her veto message, Ayotte said, “This legislation impacts people with disabilities and would conflict with federal law that requires accessible voting systems be available at all polling places during federal elections.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/votingbillsayotte-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 05:56:15.438211

Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. today. Anyone in line to vote by 7 p.m. will be allowed to cast their ballot beyond the 7 p.m. closure.
2025 Mississippi Special Election Guide: See the candidates, find your Senate or House legislative district
​​A federal three-judge panel ordered Mississippi to conduct special elections for 14 legislative seats this year because the court determined the Legislature diluted Black voting strength when lawmakers redrew legislative districts.
The federal panel specifically ordered the state to have special elections for House districts in the Chickasaw County area, Senate districts in the Hattiesburg area and Senate districts in the DeSoto County area.
Four seats are not contested, which means only one candidate filed paperwork to run in the race. But 10 of the legislative seats are being contested. 
Tuesday is primary election day, where voters must choose to participate in either the Republican primary or the Democratic primary. If no candidate in a primary election receives an outright majority of the votes cast, then the two candidates who received the most votes will participate in a primary runoff on September 2. 
However, only Senate District  42, which includes portions of Forrest, Greene, Jones and Wayne counties, allows for the mathematical possibility of a runoff election because three Republican candidates are running. 
After party primaries, the Republican and Democratic nominees will compete in a general election on November 4. 
If voters have any questions about voting on Election Day, they can contact their local circuit clerk or the secretary of state’s elections hotline at 1-800-829-6786. For more voter information, visit to the secretary of state’s Elections and Voting portal.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/22153339/Mayoral-runoff-voting-4.jpg,,,2025-08-05 05:56:15.438211
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-05 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Courtney addresses budget ‘shortfall’ on Virginia-class submarines,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/05/courtney-virginia-class-submarines/,"Courtney's amendment gives the Virginia-class submarine program a $1 billion boost, keeping up the two-a-year cadence for FY 2026.","After debate over procurement last year, the Virginia-class submarine program is on track to maintain its two-per-year cadence for the upcoming fiscal year. 
But U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and other lawmakers warned that there are funding gaps in the White House budget request.
Courtney is seeking to fill in that gap as Congress hashes out its annual defense policy bill that authorizes, among other things, shipbuilding needs. That money could help Groton-based Electric Boat and others address the growing costs of materials and backlogs in production as the submarine industry tries to meet the long-term goals of both the Navy and a U.S. submarine deal with Australia.
To shore up support for two nuclear-powered vessels in fiscal year 2026, Courtney proposed an amendment for an additional $1 billion that went into the House’s version of the National Defense Authorization Act. The House Armed Services Committee easily passed it in a voice vote in mid-July, though the bill is still working its way through Congress before it’s likely finalized later this year.
“We worked with the Navy. We basically went through 24 different line items in the Navy’s budget to basically scrub and squeeze funds to pay for that billion dollars,” Courtney said, noting it got done in time for the committee markup of the NDAA last month. “I think there’s real urgency to make sure that the program keeps the momentum up and gets the right production cadence.”
Courtney, the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said the shortfall comes amid the administration’s two-pronged approach to funding the procurement of two Virginia-class for the new fiscal year: paying for one boat through the standard budget process and covering the other through the budget reconciliation process used to pass President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
That bill, which was signed into law in early July, included $4.6 billion in funding for a second boat for fiscal year 2026. An initial version of the legislation had the money designated for fiscal year 2027.
Now that Congress has moved on to the NDAA and regular appropriations process, they are sorting out the funding for the other submarine. The White House’s FY26 base budget request sought about $816 million for standard procurement plus a few billion for advanced procurement of long lead-time materials for future submarines.
To address what was viewed as inadequate funding for two submarines, the House committee ultimately approved the NDAA by combining the $816 million with the $1 billion from Courtney’s amendment for standard procurement for FY26.
Lawmakers in both parties took issue with the Trump administration’s approach to funding the nuclear-powered submarines and the way it relied on the special budgetary process to pass Trump’s tax bill that also included substantial defense funds.
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., expressed dismay over the process during a June hearing with Navy officials, a few weeks before Congress approved the reconciliation bill.
The shipbuilding component in the White House’s defense budget request for FY26 is $20.8 billion, which lawmakers pointed out was well below the nearly $37 billion sought last year under the Biden administration.
Wicker said the Navy’s shipbuilding request “falls far short to protect our country” and “game[s] the budget in anticipation of budget reconciliation, which was intended as a supplemental, not a substitute.” Since that hearing, the reconciliation bill has become law and the White House released its FY26 defense budget plan in full.
Navy officials said they are committed to getting the industry back on track to carry out the service’s shipbuilding needs and bolster capacity. U.S. Navy Secretary John Phelan said he visited 10 shipyards since he took the helm, including trips to Electric Boat locations in Groton and Quonset Point in Rhode Island back in April.
“For too long, we’ve allowed our shipbuilding industry to erode, hollowing out the very capacity we need to maintain credible naval deterrents. That must change. Rebuilding our maritime industrial base is not just a matter of economic policy, it is a national security imperative,” Phelan said at the June hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. “We do need to act with urgency, and this will take a whole-of-government approach to rebuild our capacity and expertise.”
The Navy and Electric Boat declined to comment on the FY26 Virginia-class funding.
Courtney similarly raised concerns about a “fragmented” budget process for the Virginia-class program split between reconciliation and the base budget bill. But he credited the bipartisan work on the House’s NDAA for addressing the issue.
He also pointed out that the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget will have discretion over the sub funding covered in the reconciliation bill since that agency oversaw the process.
“It just created more confusion about the normal budget process, and that’s why it was such a scramble, because no one really had any clarity about the budget,” Courtney said. “And we still kind of don’t already, because we still haven’t completed NDAA and we still haven’t completed the appropriations process.”
“Once the reconciliation bill got passed, at least there was some clarity that you could go into the programs and try to clean up the gaps that were exposed,” he continued. “There’s definitely going to be more work to be done to make all these pieces sort of fit together.”
But between the funding through the various legislation — reconciliation, the NDAA and defense appropriations legislation — and his amendment, Courtney argued the Virginia-class program is “very secure.”
“Honestly, for FY26, there was never a question that there was going to be two subs whether there was a budget reconciliation bill or not,” he said. “And it just shows there’s just huge consensus about the fact that there was going to be two subs in FY26.”
His eastern Connecticut district includes Electric Boat’s Groton shipyard and many of the suppliers that work with the General Dynamics company. Electric Boat locations in Groton and Quonset Point, R.I., handle much of the Virginia-class program, along with Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia.
But these sub costs are changing because some of the contracts were authorized before the pandemic, and prices for materials have grown. Plus, some of the subs under construction are different models and require more to build them.
Courtney noted some of the newer vessels will feature a payload module that includes more missile tubes and thus are bigger and more expensive. Ships built over the last two decades displace about 7,800 tons submerged, while the Virginia Payload Module surpasses 10,000 tons.
“It’s new design and new size, and so that’s where the cost issues arise,” he said.
Wicker also raised concerns at the June hearing that the upcoming Columbia-class submarines are also underfunded. Electric Boat is also the lead contractor on the nuclear-powered ballistic missiles vessels to replace its Ohio-class submarines. It is similarly working with Newport News Shipbuilding on the construction.
The House’s NDAA would authorize incremental funding for one Columbia submarine, which Courtney said “is the way to keep the lights on.” The GOP’s reconciliation didn’t include any funding for that program.
The goal of the Navy is producing two Virginia-class and one Columbia-class a year. But the actual production rate has been below that for Virginia, around 1.2 boats per year since 2022, according to a March report from the Congressional Research Service.
That has resulted in a backlog, though the report said the Navy and the sub industry are aiming to get the production rate to two a year by 2028 and eventually up to 2.33 boats a year. If they can hit those markers, that’ll allow contractors to keep up with the pace of Virginia-class procurement. And it’ll help meet the needs of AUKUS, the trade agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S., so Australia can buy between three and five Virginia-class submarines starting in the early 2030s.
While it passed out of both House and Senate committees this month, the annual defense policy bill is still in the early stages. The NDAA authorizes defense spending, but lawmakers will still need to go through separate appropriations bills to allocate such funding.
In the coming months, Congress is likely to use another short-term bill, or a continuing resolution, to keep the government running. While that will keep most federal funding at current levels, lawmakers can use what’s known as anomalies to make adjustments and provide more funding in certain cases.
Last December, lawmakers passed a short-term funding bill that included $5.7 billion in emergency funding for the submarine industrial base. In the fiscal year 2025 defense policy bill, Congress provided full funding for one Virginia-class submarine and “incremental” funding for a second.
Courtney commended the Navy at a June hearing for releasing the submarine industrial base funds approved last year. He said it played a role in helping to resolve contract issues between Electric Boat and the Marine Draftsmen’s Association, whose membership was preparing to go on strike in the spring.
He said it “boost[ed] wage rates of metal trades workers in southern New England by 30% over a 5-year span.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP531536494170-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-08-05 05:56:15.438211

(Getty Images.)Ohio’s candidates for governor have filed their first campaign finance reports, offering a glimpse of two starkly different campaigns.
Democratic candidate Amy Acton raised $1.35 million — a record, her campaign said, for a non-incumbent Democratic governor this far from election day.
Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy dramatically out-raised his opponent, bringing in $9.7 million over the same stretch. Also last week, a super-PAC supporting Ramaswamy reported almost double that amount, led by a $10 million contribution from Pennsylvania billionaire businessman Jeff Yass.

Ramaswamy, whose net worth is about $1 billion, has yet to put any of his own money behind his bid.
“Raising this historic amount in just four months sends a powerful message: Ohioans are eager for bold, transformative leadership that will propel our state to new heights,” Ramaswamy Campaign Manager Jonathan Ewing said in a press release.
More than a year out from election day, Ramaswamy has largely cleared the Republican field. He’s picked up endorsements from President Donald Trump,Vice President JD Vance, and the Ohio Republican Party. Prominent Republicans including Attorney General Dave Yost and Treasurer Robert Sprague saw the writing on the wall and abandoned their own bids for governor.
Former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill is still in the race. Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel has previously said he is considering running.
Acton is the only Democrat to declare her candidacy for governor at this point.
Acton’s campaign touted the number of small dollar donations they received and the fact that they got checks from all 88 of Ohio’s counties. Although the campaign couldn’t match Ramaswamy’s fundraising totals, they cast that as a positive.
“While Vivek Ramaswamy continues to rely on personal wealth and billionaire donors to fund his race, Amy is proud of the tens of thousands of small-dollar donations from grassroots supporters in all 88 counties,” Acton Campaign Manager Philip Stein said. “We’re excited to continue to bring people together from all sides of the political spectrum who know she’s the right choice for Governor.”
On social media, Acton emphasized the contrast between the campaign’s expenditures as well.
Acton said she’s been driving around Ohio in a union-worker built Jeep “like a normal person,” while Ramaswamy “has given $160,000 of campaign funds to what appears to be one of his own companies (“V Leasing LLC”) for a private jet to fly in.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Ramaswamy’s campaign about V Leasing but got no response. The address listed for the company, however, is a residence owned by Ramaswamy and his wife.
In addition to the V Leasing expenses, Ramaswamy’s campaign racked up another $66,500 in travel expenses with two private airfare companies.


You cannot make this up. While I have been traveling across Ohio in a car (a Jeep made by @UAW members, I’ll add) like a normal person, @VivekGRamaswamy has given $160,000 of campaign funds to what appears to be one of his own companies (“V Leasing LLC”) for a private jet to fly… pic.twitter.com/2Q3fSgZHTu

What to make of it
University of Cincinnati Political Scientist David Niven stressed that this far out, there’s no way to know what issues will define the race. But the early presence of a super-PAC means “a lot more money,” and a more “nationalized” race. Niven warned that’s a double-edged sword.
“(Ramaswamy) is nationalizing the race, but he’s going to nationalize it in both directions,” Niven said, “which means he’s going to inject national interest in his campaign, but he’s also going to inject national interest in his opponent’s campaign.”
In 2022, Peter Thiel poured $15 million into then-U.S. Sen. candidate JD Vance’s campaign. That helped Vance make it out of a crowded primary field, but probably not as much as Donald Trump’s endorsement.
After the primary, Vance’s Democratic opponent former U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, out-raised Vance significantly. But when it came to outside spending, from groups like super-PACs, Republicans ended up with a distinct advantage. The same pattern played out in last year’s U.S. Senate race between then-Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican challenger Bernie Moreno.
One way or another, Niven thinks Ramaswamy leading the money race is a near certainty: But with a reputation for harsh rhetoric and a “massive personality” the Republican candidate might rub some voters the wrong way, which could give Democrats an opening, but only if their candidate can get the campaign off the ground.
In contrast, Niven pointed to pollsters finding large shares of voters who didn’t know who former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley was shortly before she faced Gov. Mike DeWine in the 2022 election. Even if Acton is running a solid fundraising operation, Niven argued the campaign needs to figure out how to convert that into attention before voters head to the polls.
“She hasn’t had a moment to seize Ohioans attention,” Niven explained. “She hasn’t had a moment where, you know, everyone in Ohio is thinking about what she had to say or what she did. That’s a very high standard. That’s what she’s got to be working for.”
“I mean, I don’t know that a Democrat’s done that in Ohio in the last 20 years,” he added, “But that’s the goal right now.”
The 2026 Election
In addition to the statewide race for Ohio governor in 2026, all of Ohio’s other statewide executive offices are up for election as open seats, and the state also has one Ohio Supreme Court race and another U.S. Senate race.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, who was appointed by DeWine to fill Vance’s seat after he was elected vice president, will face his first election cycle for the seat.
Gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe of Columbus is the only announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026. Recently former Sen. Sherrod Brown met with U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, fueling speculation Brown might make a 2026 run.
Republican lawmakers made Ohio Supreme Court races partisan in 2022. The sole remaining Democratic justice on the 6-1 court, Jennifer Brunner, faces a challenge from Republican Justice Patrick F. Fischer, as Fischer would be, by law, too old to run for reelection to his own seat in 2028.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026.
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)From a young age, I recall my parents relentlessly emphasizing the dangers of smoking. They were aware of its negative impact on my health and were determined to prevent me from developing an addictive and destructive habit.  
Their message, coupled with the national anti-smoking campaigns of the late 1990s, helped me internalize the positive habit of never picking up a cigarette. Seemingly, my entire generation internalized this habit. The rate of smoking tumbled when it came to millennials.   
Fast-forward to 2025, there is a parallel national campaign targeting something equally detrimental and in ubiquitous use by Generations Z and Alpha: social media and screens. At this point, the harmful effects of excessive social media use and prolonged screen time are well-documented.  
This national campaign aims to decrease the time developing minds spend on screens and social media. This summer, New Hampshire joined this effort by implementing a statewide, bell-to-bell ban on student cellphone use in public schools. For its supporters, this ban is considered a substantial step toward mitigating the digital harms that affect society’s most intelligent individuals. However, several challenges still persist.
Supporters of the ban should build on this success by identifying the next step in harm reduction: in-home education about the effects of overusing social media and screens.
There is one caveat to mention here. While I was advised never to pick up a cigarette, it would be foolish to tell developing minds to never pick up screens or social media. Given how economically integrated social media and screens are, at the right age, young minds must be allowed to demonstrate the positive habits they have learned with these technologies to become college- and career-ready. Positive habits such as: limiting screen time, information literacy, focusing strategies, and resilience. 
Below are four book recommendations for parents and guardians raising children in the age of screens and social media. By reading these books, parents and guardians will gain a better understanding of how the current digital information environment is harming developing minds.  They will also be empowered to develop strategies that help their children develop positive digital information habits.
Four must-read books for parents and guardians

“Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention — and How to Think Deeply Again”

In “Stolen Focus,” Johann Hari examines why sustained attention is eroding via the technology developing minds are using every day. Parents and guardians will find practical guidance for nurturing sustained attention in their children. Hari outlines strategies to establish screen time limits that will enable offline curiosity and deeper thinking. He also places a premium on the value of family routines that reinforce focus and critical thought. For Hari, attention is not merely personal, it is a necessary component of positive social interactions. 

“The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness”

This book stands out as the most indispensable work on this list. In this seminal work, Jonathan Haidt establishes a direct link between the alarming rise in mental health concerns among young people and the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media. His research has played a pivotal role in shaping a national push to establish clearer limits on screen use and delay access for children. 
The book outlines steps families can take to support in-person interaction, improve sleep, and encourage childhood resilience through minimally supervised, physical play. Haidt’s work is currently guiding lawmakers and educators in their creation of new policies and curricula. For parents and guardians, it is a practical resource for building healthier digital habits in the current digital information environment.

“Verified: How to Think Straight, Get Duped Less, and Make Better Decisions about What to Believe Online”

Mike Caulfield and Sam Wineburg offer a practical guide to navigating the overwhelming amount of  digital information available. The book presents clear schemas, such as the SIFT method, for evaluating sources and identifying synthetic content, including AI-generated images and false websites. Designed for readers of all ages, it is highly accessible and emphasizes adopting daily habits that can be immediately implemented. 
Parents and guardians can use this book with their children as a step-by-step workbook, building routines for checking credibility online. The authors emphasize straightforward solutions rather than alarm. In an information environment unlike any experienced by previous generations, the book provides families with tools to navigate the internet more cautiously.

“How to Raise a Healthy Gamer: End Power Struggles, Break Bad Screen Habits, and Transform Your Relationship with Your Kids”

In How to Raise a Healthy Gamer, Alok Kanojia examines how gaming has become a dominant behavioral and developmental force for Generations Z and Alpha. He outlines how many children use games to process information, often at the cost of real-word social connection and emotional health.
Rather than push for blanket restrictions, Kanojia offers families practical ways to mitigate harmful patterns and reset habits. The book provides structure for parents and guardians to rebuild trust and positive routines around gaming.
Emergent AI considerations
A book examining the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on developing minds is conspicuously absent from the above list. 
AI, as a consumable product, is quite nascent. In the form of Large Language Models, it has only been around for fewer than four years. Consequently, research on its long-term impact is not available. 
Despite this, several emerging concerns persist. One concern is that interactions with AI could result in increased data collection from children by tech companies. This not only raises potential legal issues related to laws protecting children from online data mining, but also prompts deeper questions about how this data might be used to influence or manipulate young minds.
Another concern is how children are interacting with AI companion chatbots. These companions mimic human behavior, are hyper-enabling, and tailor themselves to the users’ exact desires. This alluring mixture of attributes has led some users to become so emotionally enamored that they propose marriage to their AI companion. Furthermore, recent lawsuits against tech companies by parents have alleged that their children took their lives because of the isolating, unhealthy, and ill-regulated relationships that they developed with AI companions. 
The final area of concern that demands attention is the impact that persistent AI use has on critical thinking development. There has already been some research about the cognitive offloading that occurs when an individual forgoes a deep-thinking task — such as writing or research — by leveraging AI. Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, has been vocal about the cognitive harms overreliance on AI can cause.
Much like social media and screens, AI is poised for profound economic integration. Therefore, young minds need to develop positive AI literacy and collaboration habits. In addition, a national education campaign is needed to illuminate the potential risks of AI for developing minds.
By the late 1990s, the chance to educate the public about the dangers of smoking had nearly slipped away. The harm had already been done, and the effort to reverse it was arduous and legally fraught. Today, a similar situation has emerged with social media and screen use. The education efforts are still catching up and still measuring the harm. As artificial intelligence becomes more present, it is imprudent to wait for its potential harm to evince itself. Now is the time to encourage positive habits and cultivate a clear understanding of harm, before the same mistakes are repeated.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/instalogin-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 04:57:59.679093

As areas across Ohio struggle with power outages and blackouts during the high heat, energy companies are seeking to increase utility bills.
This comes as new testimony accuses the state’s utility regulating body of trying to go easy on and help energy companies.
It’s been a hot and expensive summer.
“It’s gone up, I would say about a third this year,” Parma resident Sean Brennan said.
Brennan knows that his utility costs typically go up this time of year, but it’s what is happening behind the scenes that worries him.
“The utilities really have an inordinate amount of power, despite the fact that the power should really rest in the hands of the people,” he said.
He became a Democratic state representative, trying to help people like him frustrated by bills.
This is why he is worried that FirstEnergy is petitioning the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to approve a rate hike of $190 million.
If approved, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel (OCC) estimated that Cleveland Illuminating Company consumers will see a $13 price increase per month, Ohio Edison will have a $3 spike, and Toledo Edison a $1.50 increase.
In testimony provided to the PUCO by a representative from FirstEnergy, they said that their “current base distribution rates are insufficient to provide them reasonable compensation for the electric distribution.”
This means they claim that it takes them too much money to get power to homes.
“If things were done in a more transparent manner, I think they’d have a lot more credibility when they make those types of arguments,” Brennan said.
The PUCO is still under fire for its part in the Ohio House Bill 6 scandal, where their former chair, Sam Randazzo, was accused of being a key player in the largest bribery scheme in state history.
How we got here
Back in 2019, former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder took a $61 million bribe in exchange for legislation to give utility company FirstEnergy a $1 billion bailout at ratepayers’ expense.
In March 2023, a jury found Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges guilty of felony racketeering.
Neil Clark, a lobbyist accused in the racketeering scheme, died by suicide after pleading not guilty in 2021. Householder was sentenced to 20 years in prison while Borges got five.
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, former FirstEnergy Senior Vice President Michael Dowling, and Randazzo were all hit with state bribery charges.
Each pleaded not guilty during their joint arraignment in mid-February 2024.
In April 2024, Randazzo became the second defendant to die by suicide.
New details
At the end of June, a legal transcript from the OCC’s cross-examined an auditor who admitted that PUCO staff asked him to delete information and recommendations that would have helped protect consumers.
The OCC said that PUCO, under Randazzo, was encouraging auditors to go easy on utility companies and to let them review drafts of the audits before publishing.
No one was available to defend the PUCO or FirstEnergy, but the utility giant did give us a statement, saying they could not comment on whether they had been working with the PUCO for better audits.
“We are unable to comment on the PUCO hearings or matters related to HB6 given the ongoing litigation,” FirstEnergy spokesperson Hannah Catlett said.
She added that the price hike request included other provisions.
“Separately, the rate review request FirstEnergy filed with the PUCO aims to recover costs of providing distribution service to customers, including significant service reliability improvements made in recent years,” she said.
Utility company AEP, which also benefited from the corrupt legislation, dove further into why prices increased.
“This summer, the generation portion of bills increased 27% for customers on our standard service plan because of the imbalance between supply and demand. While the generation supply charge shows up on customers’ AEP Ohio bills, it is not an AEP Ohio charge and we make no profit off of it. We pass the charge through, dollar for dollar with no markup, from the generation suppliers to the customers,” an AEP spokesperson said.
The PUCO never responded to our request for comment.
Householder’s attorney Scott Pullins previously told us that there is a reason costs go up.
“Our electric grid needs to be modernized, and I’m assuming that those are where those costs are going,” Pullins said.
Brennan said this is unacceptable, as FirstEnergy and other companies continue to have outages and blackouts in the 90-degree heat.
“A lot of folks out there feel that they’re powerless, pun intended,” Brennan said.
The PUCO will continue to evaluate the increase request.

There are many things that have changed for the better in North Carolina prisons over the last century.
That said, it’s also true that North Carolina summers have always been miserably hot and that commercial air conditioning was first introduced nearly a century ago — facts that render the lack of air conditioning in many of our state’s prisons today an absolute scandal.
The Department of Correction has been pursuing an initiative to finally end this tortuous situation, but there remains a long way to go as many facilities remain unairconditioned.
And that harsh reality is a threat to everyone in the facility – guards and incarcerated people alike – especially men and women prisoners who are elderly and in bad health.
The bottom line: As with the lack of adequate staff and so many other inhumanities in our prison system, it’s our cheapskate legislature’s refusal to appropriate adequate funds that is ultimately to blame. One wishes each lawmaker would have to spend a summer night in one of these facilities to experience the cruel and unusual punishment their inaction is inflicting.

Twenty-seven young women and staff from the Camp Mystic near Kerrville, Texas. Apparently, many were still asleep or just waking when the early morning flood cut loose. It was as if a bomb went off.
They slept as danger and death were imminent. This lesson speaks volumes, and not just of water. These days, bombs go off daily while we ignore the danger. They detonate in Congress, the courts, our statehouses, the White House. But we sleep on.
Sometimes, we sense subtle nudges of the danger. Our hometown of Salina lost no lives directly, but Salina’s Smoky Hill flood logjam has become a major fascination — and budget headache. A forest of logs and wood debris help flood local ballfields, now rendered momentarily unusable.
Such unexpected high waters offer us a mirror. Camp Mystic, however, is starker than any mirror.
Described as a “safe haven” and a place for spiritual solace, Camp Mystic was known for its beauty — and hosting the children of Laura Bush and granddaughters of LBJ. Lady Bird Johnson sometimes came to camp closings.
How could they not have been warned?
A well-functioning National Weather Service might have helped. But Trump had already canned 600 workers. Oblivious, he merely blamed nature. “This is a hundred-year catastrophe,” he said. “So horrible to watch.”
This was no 100-year event. Climate chaos chickens have come home to roost. Our leaders’ response, stunningly, has only been to cut and gut.
Except for the bombs.
In Gaza, more than 59,000 Palestinians are dead, more than half of them women and children. Though the latest Texas flood numbers are shocking and sad (136 lives lost), they’re overwhelmed by the tsunami of Palestine.
Instead of ending the slaughter, U.S. leaders sent untold billions of our tax dollars to Israel for death and destruction, in short, for genocide. Hospitals, schools and residences destroyed; survivors starved; many more killed in food distribution deathtraps.
Whether these bombs are climate-related or human-engineered, their common origin is a refusal to face reality. Many U.S. citizens falsely assume “we” are protected. Those who don’t are labeled leftist radicals, woke or worse.
Otherwise good people hold such beliefs. A personal story may illustrate. On the day U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall voted to cut and gut the already appropriated $1.1 billion for NPR and PBS, I expressed my anger at the betrayal to some local coffee group friends. “Now, we have to be responsible for our representatives’ irresponsibility,” I said.
“I’m glad it was gutted,” said one older gentleman. “They’re just communist propagandists, anyway.”
I told him that wasn’t true.
He said, “Well, you’ve clearly been listening to AOC.”
I didn’t argue further. My time is valuable. And yet, how have we come to this?
A recent Nation magazine article labels us the “Dis-United States.” Kevin Willmott, well-known Kansas filmmaker and writer, reported that his 20-year-old film, “Confederate States of America,” envisioned what would have happened had the slave states won the Civil War. They didn’t, but in today’s United States, Willmott writes, “the Confederacy has gobbled up the Union.”
“The Trump administration’s ongoing attack on the federal bureaucracy and wholesale cancellation of government programs; the quest to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion policies; the erasure of Black history; and the reinstatement of Confederate names on military bases — all are clear attempts to revive the white supremacy of the CSA,” he writes. “So is the clearly unconstitutional attempt to revoke birthright citizenship, as enshrined in the 14th Amendment, drawn up and ratified by the victors of the Civil War.”
At a Memphis showing of his film, an older white woman receptionist said: “The South will rise again.” It already has.
In a flood of bad news, the only explanation for the public’s trance is the hero worship found in professional wrestling. We need not delineate all Trump’s connections to that world. But Greg Olear lays it out:
“Flabby Donald (assumes) the physique of Hulk Hogan, Rocky Balboa, and Rambo. … The guns, the fist pump. “Fight, fight, fight.”
He adds: “This is Geopolitical WrestleMania. … We should know by now what’s real and what’s fake, but fantasy and reality have blurred together, … the special effects are too good, and it’s fun — FUN! — to have heroes and heels, decisive winners and irredeemable losers.”
We have been sold down the river. Trump’s Billionaire Buyout Bill leaves miles of destruction in its wake.
If you want to avoid the flood, stay alert and get to higher ground. This is your siren call.

Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted both swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States and “bear true faith and allegiance to the same” before taking their seats.

Jon Husted, left, and Bernie Moreno, right. (Official photos.)Ohio Republican U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted both swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States and “bear true faith and allegiance to the same” before taking their seats. But their promised loyalty to the rule of law was quickly supplanted by unyielding loyalty to a twice-impeached felon with a vindictive streak.
 It appears their unwavering commitment to “bear faith and allegiance” is first and foremost to Donald Trump. Obeyance without question. 
They support and defend whatever he wants legislatively, regardless of consequences. 
Moreno and Husted both approved massive Trump tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, businesses, and large corporations that will balloon our national debt by trillions while leaving behind or raising costs for millions of working families in Ohio and across America. 
They voted for the “big beautiful” bill that overwhelmingly favors the richest 10% in the country while savagely gutting programs everyday families depend on from health care and food assistance to public safety programs. 
The Ohio Republicans will doge and weave about the severe ramifications of the wildly unpopular bill they enacted but rave over the “no taxes on tips” temporary program that will, in fact, result in little to no benefits for many workers.
Ohio’s GOP senators decided early on to singularly appease Donald Trump (and give lip service to constituents?) in straight party line votes on his flagship legislation (even if it cruelly defunds programs for Ohioans trying to make ends meet) and on whomever he nominates, regardless of quality or controversy. 
For a minute last week, it seemed their slavish devotion would keep them in sweltering D.C. during the entire August recess. Trump demanded the Senate confirm his backlog of nominees, who “should NOT BE FORCED TO WAIT,” before adjourning.  
Moreno and Husted had their blanket “yes” votes ready to go — but Senate Democrats suddenly grew a spine to thwart Trump’s ultimatum. Who knew? They conditioned approval for “historically bad nominees (who) deserve a historical level of scrutiny” on the release of congressionally appropriated funds (largely for the National Institutes of Health) illegally frozen by the White House. 
Trump went into a tailspin on social media, telling Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to “GO TO HELL.” 
But the standoff went nowhere, and senators headed home without a deal and just a handful of confirmations.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, Moreno and Husted will always have bragging rights for their roles in confirming what is easily one of Trump’s most appalling picks for the federal judiciary. Both Ohio Republicans helped put Emil Bove, Trump’s former criminal defense attorney and so-called Justice Department “enforcer” of his retribution campaign, on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals — where Bove could conceivably review one of hundreds of lawsuits against the Trump administration. Where his impartiality would be a punch line in a bad joke.
Bove demonstrated total sycophancy to the president during his corrosive stint at the Justice Department. 
Trump pardoned all the Jan. 6 insurrectionists criminally convicted for violently storming the U.S. Capitol. Bove complemented that depravity by personally firing Jan. 6 prosecutors (purely for political reasons) while echoing Trump’s assertion that their arduous case work was “a grave national injustice.” 
Bove also called for the FBI agents who investigated the attack to be identified and fired. He ordered career prosecutors in New York to abruptly drop corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams in an apparent quid pro quo for Adams’s help in Trump’s immigration roundups. Stunned attorneys resigned in protest rather than “abdicate our legal and ethical obligations in favor of directions from Washington.”
Multiple whistleblowers came forward with corroborating accounts of Bove encouraging Department of Justice lawyers to defy court orders and intentionally mislead judges about administration policies. They warned Republican senators that Bove had lied during his confirmation hearing. Over 900 former DOJ prosecutors and dozens of former federal and state judges pleaded with senators to reject such a manifestly unfit nominee for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench. 
Yet, instead of recoiling at all the red flags raised about Bove’s alleged misconduct, nearly every Senate Republican, including Ohio’s Tweedledee and Tweedledum, rewarded him with an appellate court judgeship. 
Clearly, it was more crucial for them to be counted as unswerving Trump loyalists than to preserve the integrity of federal courts. 
Federal judges must adhere to a code of ethics that requires them to “maintain and enforce high standards of conduct,” to “respect and comply with the law,” and, most importantly, to “not be swayed by partisan interests.”  
A ton of evidence plainly showed Bove did not meet these minimum qualifications but Republican senators, like Moreno and Husted, pretended otherwise. 
They surrendered their constitutional mandate to advise and consent and lined up behind a faithful Trump footsoldier. 
By rushing to confirm Bove to a powerful circuit court — without bothering to hear from witnesses with substantiated testimony about his purported lawless behavior — every Senate Republican, save two, declared fealty to Trump over duty to protect the rule of law and an independent judiciary. 
They betrayed their oath of office and those who naively expected more of their U.S. senators than to blindly execute Donald Trump’s agenda — no questions asked. 
Shame on you, Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted. Do better for your state and country.

U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
 Undermining ERIC

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
Why Republican-led states keep leaving a group that verifies voter rolls

“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
 ‘A total shock’

In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

,Maryland Matters,2025-08-05 04:54:41+00:00,Maryland Matters,Why are farmers so concerned about solar legislation passed in Maryland this year?,Christine Condon,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/08/05/maryland-solar-law-reca-farmers/,"Maryland farmers fear that thousands of acres of Maryland farmland could soon be producing solar energy, rather than corn, wheat and soybeans — potentially disrupting a delicate agro-economy.","The Lime Kiln community solar project in Howard County, pictured after a ribbon cutting ceremony on July 8, 2025.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)For some Maryland farmers and rural landowners, the mailers seem to come in habitually, promising thousands of dollars per acre to lease their land so it can become a solar array.
“Lease for Solar, Harvest Profits,” one company writes. “You can help power the future of our country,” writes another.
The letters offer $4,500 per acre, $5,000 or even $7,000, sometimes with lucrative sign-on bonuses, too.
Some farmers worry it’s a pressure that Maryland’s agricultural communities cannot withstand. They fear that thousands of acres of Maryland farmland could soon be producing solar energy, rather than corn, wheat and soybeans — potentially disrupting a delicate agro-economy in places like the Eastern Shore, where it’s built around feeding the poultry industry.
And they think that the law passed by the General Assembly this year — setting uniform standards for solar facilities and limiting counties’ ability to set solar zoning rules — will only make matters worse.
“I got three, four solar invitations yesterday in the mail. I’ve had telephone calls. I’ve had different companies come see me,” said Howard Dean, a Queen Anne’s County farmer, during an interview in late May. “I’m not interested. I want the farmland to stay as it is, and for our families in the future to have this beautiful county — and this Eastern Shore.”
In particular, they worry about a provision in the bill, which sets a ceiling on solar projects at 5% of any one county’s agricultural “priority preservation areas.” But some farmers worry the limit is set far too high.
If you ask the solar industry, farmers’ fears are unfounded.
“We’re not taking over — as an industry — all the farmland,” said John Finnerty, the director of business development for Standard Solar, a Rockville-based solar energy company.
They believe the Maryland bill could ease solar project development in Maryland, in part by undoing restrictive county codes. But plenty of roadblocks still remain. For one thing, they’re watching federal tax incentives for solar projects disappear, thanks to congressional approval of President Donald Trump’s (R) “big, beautiful bill.”

And there are still the logistical challenges: Finding an optimal site with a willing landowner, and — if needed — hooking up to an electric grid clogged with proposals for new power generation.
“There is already natural, technical and practical limitations to where solar can be sited, and those limitations still exist,” said Leah Meredith, director of state affairs in the Mid-Atlantic region for the Solar Energy Industries Association. “But in terms of the speed at which projects can be designed, approved and deployed — and cutting inefficiencies and costs — that’s the value of the legislation.”
The law, named the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, passed Maryland’s legislature as part of a three-bill energy package championed by Democratic leadership, focused on bolstering in-state power generation amid soaring utility bills across the state.
It advanced largely without the backing of Republican legislators, who took to the floor one after another with concerns about how the bill would impact agricultural lands. Democrats fought back, arguing that all property owners have a right to decide what to do with their land — including by welcoming solar.
The issue has united residents of rural areas across the state, who mounted an ill-fated attempt to bring the bill to referendum after it was signed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) — from the Eastern Shore to Montgomery County, which is Maryland’s most populous county, but also hosts plenty of farmland of its own.
Caroline Taylor, executive director of the Montgomery Countryside Alliance, said the issue has prompted farmers sometimes at odds with one another to unite. Eastern Shore farmers are ditching the notion that Montgomery County agriculture is merely a “hobby,” Taylor said, and Montgomery farmers are acknowledging that “voices from well-connected, well-populated, Montgomery County” are often heard first.
“For us to be able to come together and understand each other — and understand the commonalities and the challenges that are somewhat the same — and for us to acknowledge that they’ve been more in the crosshairs than we have been to date, I think has been important,” Taylor said.
A zoning puzzle
Before RECA, developing solar in Maryland felt like something of a minefield, said John Miller, vice president of development at Chaberton Energy, a solar developer also headquartered in Rockville.
Maryland may have 24 jurisdictions , but the list of counties where large-scale projects are likely to succeed dwindles to fewer than 10, Miller said.
To start with, utility-scale solar projects are already less common in Maryland, difficult as they are to execute without massive swaths of available land, Miller said. So the favored option for developers like Chaberton is “community solar,” smaller scale projects under 5 megawatts with a network of local subscribers, who receive credits on their energy bills.
Maryland fires back against EPA claims about its offshore wind permit

The General Assembly made community solar a permanent option in Maryland in 2023, after seven years as a pilot program, during which time 139 projects were greenlit.
But community solar can only be developed in communities served by Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pepco, Potomac Edison or Delmarva Power, cutting out the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, for instance.
Then came the patchwork of local zoning regulations, some of which functioned as “de facto prohibitions,” Miller said.
Anne Arundel, for instance, set a limit requiring rural solar projects to be 10 miles apart, shrinking the available land. Queen Anne’s County created a district for utility-scale solar within a few miles of an existing power transmission line. Montgomery County fenced off certain prime soil types. And the list goes on from there.
By Miller’s count, about seven friendly counties are left over. Meanwhile, Maryland has a climate pollution reduction goal of generating 14.5% of its energy from solar, whether in-state or out of state.
“We have to fit our entire state goal in these seven counties, and that’s where the equitable distribution comes into play,” Miller said. “Now, you’re asking only a small number of counties to carry the entire burden for the entire State.”
He hopes the new law will open the playing field, forcing the restrictive counties to adopt the state’s new rules for solar farms, which set requirements for fencing, forested buffers and more.
“One standard is much easier to navigate than 24 different standards,” said Meredith, of SEIA, the trade association representing about 1,200 member companies.
Dominic Butchko, director of intergovernmental relations at the Maryland Association of Counties, said he starts the story in 2019. That’s when a precedent-setting Washington County court ruling said the Maryland Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities and power plant projects in the state, has the authority to pre-empt county zoning rules for any power project in its purview — essentially any project over 2 megawatts, including solar.

The court ruling granted the PSC “broad authority,” Butchko said. But the PSC seemed to be wielding it on a case-by-case basis, he said. It created something of a gray area.
Now, they all have the same rulebook to follow. There’s some “heartburn” about the General Assembly undoing the work of local governments, Butchko said, but the counties are hurriedly updating their codes to match the legislation.
MACo was initially opposed to the RECA, but reached a compromise with legislators, including the 5% cap.
Where before, solar developers might seek to bring  projects to the PSC, by making them more sizable, now they may prefer to keep projects below the PSC’s threshold and take it up with local government, with the promise of a potentially shorter review, and a uniform set of standards from place to place, Miller said.
“The state process is great, right? But it’s the state, and it’s long and it’s arduous and it’s expensive,” Miller said. “If we can go to the county and have a reasonable, understandable framework in front of us, we are more incentivized to keep the projects going through the county.”
There may still be battles yet to come, however, Miller said.
“I’m hearing about counties adding some more on to it, like incorporating it into their ordinance, but taking the RECA standards and saying: And you also have to do this,” Miller said. “So, I think there’s going to be a little bit of growing pain, but ultimately, I’m seeing more and more counties starting to integrate the policies.”
Butchko said there is a “high likelihood” of a “fix-it” bill moving through the General Assembly next year to tinker with RECA.
MACo, for its part, would like to see the language on “priority preservation areas” change, letting the handful of counties that didn’t previously have such areas designate acreage and be included in the solar cap. But legislators resisted similar amendments during this past session.
“I would be shocked if we’re not back in 2026 with something very small,” Butchko said. “We don’t want to rehash stuff. This was a good faith effort by everybody.”
‘It means more to us’
One by one, the farmers trickled into the cafeteria at the Queen Anne’s County 4-H Park on a rainy May afternoon. They came — nine in all — solely because they heard a journalist wanted to talk about solar.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bobby Hutchison, who grows corn, soybeans, wheat, barley and vegetables on his farms in Talbot and Caroline counties, said he’s driven by his reverence for the land.
“My grandfather, my father, four brothers, myself, and son and nephew. We’ve got a lot invested in that land. It means more to us than what a normal person would think,” he said.
The thought of beloved farmland becoming rows upon rows of metal panels tilted skyward, marring the largely rural landscape of the Eastern Shore, is more than just unsettling, the farmers said. Why not rooftops? Or parking lots?
But solar developers are looking for something more: Miles of flat land with minimal flood risk, where hooking into the power grid is possible.
They’re missing the bigger picture, farmers argue. A significant chunk of the grains grown on the Eastern Shore head to the poultry houses to feed chickens for Perdue, Mountaire and the like. If farm fields are taken out of production, and these companies aren’t able to obtain as much chicken feed locally, they could head elsewhere.
“It would be a sea change if poultry ever left the Eastern Shore,” said Jamie Raley, president of the Maryland Farm Bureau.
He worries that a loss of available agricultural acreage to solar development could also make it more difficult for young farmers to enter the industry, stymieing its growth further.
“We respect people’s private property rights — let them do what they want to do. But we still continue to communicate and remind folks that we have to preserve our farms for the next generation,” Raley said.
Mark Sultenfuss, who farms just outside of Centreville, acknowledges a poultry industry departure may still be years away.
“That’s probably not going to happen in five years, but it’s going to happen to the next generation,” said Sultenfuss, whose daughter traveled to Annapolis this year to be a legislative page. “I don’t want the next generation saying: ‘Why didn’t they do more? Why did they leave the gate open for this to happen?’”
Farmers also doubt claims from the solar industry that land could return to farming after spending decades as a solar farm. Some said they’ve seen solar companies remove natural topsoil, with its unique balance of nutrients and microorganisms, to install their panels, and leave it in a pile elsewhere on the land.

“No matter which way you want to believe it happened, it happened either [by] a glacier or God, and that’s the way it was laid out. And when you improperly move topsoils, you can never put them back the way they were,” said Matthew Jones, a Caroline County grain farmer.
Finnerty of Standard Solar said that removing topsoil is no longer a common practice in the industry.
“There may have been some projects within the industry that had done that, and it didn’t really prove out to be a good thing,” Finnerty said.
The solar debacle has left farmers feeling scorned by Annapolis.
“We’re very tired of the government in the state … our delegates, senators, whoever — a majority of them will not listen to the public the way they should, and they just take it on their own self to vote how they think,” Dean said.
Jay Falstad, a founder of Farmers Alliance for Rural Maryland, or FARM, led an unsuccessful petition drive to bring RECA to the ballot, after Moore signed it into law during his last signing session of the year. He said he was inspired by the determination of farmers, who met up with him at locations around the Eastern Shore during his roughly ten-day sprint to collect as many signatures as possible.
“I’ve sat around their kitchen table. I’ve heard their stories,” Falstad said. “They’re not doing it for the money. They’re doing it for the love of what agriculture represents. And it would be nice for our policymakers to also sit around those kitchen tables.”
Though a vocal opposition movement has developed, there are still rural landowners who are choosing solar.
Craig Crawmer and his wife, Jo-Ann Middleton — whose farmland in Howard County’s Fulton became the Lime Kiln Community Solar Project — had a plot of land that they were leasing to a farmer, who was growing hay.
“People kept asking us to develop. And to do so, there would be about 11 properties in there,” Crawmer said. “We decided: ‘Let’s look at other alternatives.’”
That’s when Crawmer received a flyer in the mail, urging him to consider solar panels. Maybe, he thought, this could be the best of both worlds, allowing the couple to bring in more income, but protecting the surrounding area from the pressures of adding more residences.
“It’s a lot more profitable,” he said. “We were probably breaking even before, and we’re substantially making a lot more revenue now.”
In early July, Crawmer watched as officials from Chaberton Energy cut the ribbon on the project, officially electrifying 13 acres worth of solar panels on his land, bordered by a tract of woods on one side and a newly planted buffer of young pine trees on the other.
“We know for at least the next 20 years, this is what we’re going to have,” Crawmer said. “And it benefits everyone, really.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HEADSHOT-147-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-05 00:56:23.533506

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for Mess With Texas Project)A small plane circled the Maryland State House throughout Monday morning and afternoon, trailing a banner with a call to action: “MESS WITH TEXAS.”
It was an apparent reference to the redistricting fight in Texas, where state Republicans are pushing for a rare mid-decade redistricting plan that would flip five U.S. House seats currently held by Democrats before next year’s elections. Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to prevent a scheduled vote Monday on the redistricting bill, while Democrats in other states are considering responding in kind it Texas goes through with its plan.
Maryland is among those states.
“What’s happening is ruinous, really, to there being any sort of state parity or ground rules,” said Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery) of the proposed Texas redistricting. “Ultimately, it just helps take accountability away from elected officials.”
Moon — who said he saw some of the on-the-lam Texas House Democrats in Boston at the National Conference of State Legislatures convention Monday — said last month that he plans to introduce a bill that would automatically trigger a Maryland redistricting if any other state redistricted “outside of the regular decennial census period.”
Typically, states redraw their congressional district boundaries every 10 years, when decennial Census numbers come out, so for Texas to do it mid-decade would be “ruinous,” Moon said. If the once-per-decade norm is broken by one state, it can affect all other states, said Moon, the House majority leader.
“If one of the 50 states decides to break from the norm and redistrict whenever they want, that’s just not a sustainable system — unless every other state also exercises that same right,” Moon said. “Ideally, once everyone has the same power, nobody exercises it, because it’s destabilizing the Congress itself to have the prospect of redistricting happen every election cycle.”

Maryland is one of the Democratic-led states considering such a response to Texas. More planes trailing “Mess with Texas” banners, backed by “an anonymous group of self-described democracy advocates,” according to Politico, had plans to fly over state capitols Monday in New York, Maine, New Jersey, Illinois and California.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the effort. Employees at two aerial advertising companies, FlySigns.com and Aerial Advertising Outdoor Maryland, were unable to confirm whether the planes had been rented from them.
A “MESS WITH TEXAS” banner was spotted Monday over Albany, according to posts on Facebook and Reddit, where New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) stood with five Texas Democratic lawmakers and said New York was looking into how it could mount a mid-decade redistrictinf if Texas does.
Maryland House Minority Leader Del. Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said he is also against mid-decade redistricting. But Texas is growing much faster than Maryland — potentially fast enough to merit one or two additional congressional districts compared to 2020, he said.
Texas is a much larger state with more minority seats than Maryland, Buckel said, so even if it redistricts, there will still be Texas seats available to Democrats. In Maryland, only one of the state’s eight congressional seats is held by a Republican.
“Under what Del. Moon is proposing, he wants to potentially gerrymander a map that would have absolutely zero Republican representation in the state,” Buckel said. “That’s just kind of absurd, and I don’t think there’s a way for them to do it.”
Maryland Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery) wrote in a post on X that he will co-sponsor Moon’s bill if it moves forward.
Vogel said he doesn’t support partisan gerrymandering, and he hopes that Texas backs away from its effort. But if Texas engages in partisan mid-decade redistricting, then Maryland will engage back, Vogel said.
“I’m by no means excited about this. First, because I do not generally support partisan gerrymandering, and second, because I think that this could result in a nationwide battle around redistricting in a way that I think further polarizes our country,” Vogel said. “But, again back to this point: Texas is starting it. Texas lawmakers are starting it.”
Moon called the current once-per-decade redistricting norm “basically a treaty among the states,” but said that treaty requires cooperation by all 50 states, which can’t be done if Texas redistricts now.
“This era of unilateral disarmament is over,” Moon said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Allegations of sexual abuse between youths in state custody. Complaints of roaches and mice crawling on students’ beds, and reports of expired and undercooked food.
Those were just some of the findings in a 49-page report by the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit on the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services that lays out some of the problems at the long-troubled agency in the greatest detail to date, a report greeted with concern and dismay by advocates and lawmakers.
“It’s very outraging,” said Aubrey Edwards-Luce, the executive director of the Sayra and Neil Meyerhoff Center for Families, Children, and the Courts at the University of Baltimore School of Law.
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel) called the report “shocking and extremely disappointing.”
“We’re talking about children,” said Bartlett,  the vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee. “I thought at least some of the basic needs of the children were being taken care of. I was shocked and disappointed to learn that they aren’t.”
The report, published July 28, detailed wide-ranging health and safety issues at facilities operated by the Department of Juvenile Services. The report covers the first six months of the year, during which former Secretary Vincent Schiraldi oversaw the agency.
Embattled DJS Secretary Vincent Schiraldi steps down

Acting Secretary Betsy Fox Tolentino, who took over in mid-June, said in a written response to the report that she implemented “critical leadership changes in the DJS Residential Services Unit.” Those include visiting facilities across the state to “observe conditions firsthand and speak directly with frontline staff” and reviewing operational and staffing challenges.
An agency spokesperson said that the office’s previous deputy secretary of residential services, executive director of residential services and director of behavioral health left the agency last week following the report.
Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) said the report “confirmed” state Republicans’ position that there were longstanding leadership issues under Schiraldi.
“Concerns for safety, food quality issues … I don’t understand how this could have gone on for so long,” he said.
Ready noted that while the findings in the recent report were alarming, it’s not the only report in recent years that brought Schiraldi’s time as secretary under fire. In May, for example, the agency was the subject of a lengthy report from state auditors who said the department failed to consistently ensure that criminal background checks were completed for every contractor working at state juvenile detention centers and treatment facilities.
But Edwards-Luce said she was not so sure that the problems identified in the report can be tied solely to Schiraldi’s time as secretary, arguing that there are longstanding issues in how the state handles youths in need of behavioral interventions.
“Atrocities abound, unfortunately,” she said.
Olinda Moyd, a member of the state’s Correctional Ombudsman Advisory Board, said the report provides specific details that haven’t been offered in previous documents. The Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit is part of the Office of the Correctional Ombudsman.
“I think we have gotten used to getting reports that are very cursory and don’t really provide the detail that we need to really know what’s happening inside these institutions,” said Moyd, director of the Decarceration and Re-Entry Clinic at the American University Washington College of Law. “I’m all about transparency.”
A convicted criminal worked with children at Maryland facility, audit finds

Moyd and other advocates helped get a bill signed into law last year creating the Office of Correctional Ombudsman, which conducts independent reviews and assessment of various programs administrated by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.
As part of the legislation sponsored by Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit was moved out of the attorney general’s office and under the ombudsman’s control.
One main reason for the push for independent oversight stemmed from various problems within the juvenile justice system. Most of the blame from Republican lawmakers was directed at Schiraldi, who was appointed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in February 2023. Schiraldi resigned June 9 of this year.
“This report seeks to identify concrete, actionable changes that can enhance daily operations, programming, treatment, and safety for both staff and youth, while also improving protections for youth in DJS operated and licensed facilities,” Ombudsman Yvonne Briley-Wilson in the introduction to the report.
Briley-Wilson did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
Bartlett said the report will help her committee assess what must be done to improve the overall well-being of children in the juvenile justice system.
“I thought the ombudsman did an excellent job of being thorough and giving specific examples that we needed. That’s the information we need as legislators to be able to conduct the oversight that we need to do,” she said. “While it was shocking and disappointing, it was still very helpful for the future.”

(File photo courtesy Montgomery County Board of Elections)Maryland election officials responded to a Justice Department request for the state’s voter rolls and procedures for maintaining them with a detailed description of election laws and directions on how federal officials could look up the publicly available information for themselves.
The six-page letter from the Maryland State Board of Elections, dated July 30, was in response to a July 14 letter from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division asking for evidence that the state is “complying with the statewide voter registration list maintenance provisions of the National Voter Registration Act.”
The letter to Maryland was just one of a number of letters that Justice has sent to states probing the integrity of voter rolls. So far, those letters have mostly targeted Democrat-led states, but federal officials told the National Association of Secretaries of State that they expect to eventually reach all 50 states and the District of Columbia with their requests.
Maryland Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis responded with a detailed description of state and federal laws that dictate how state and county election officials maintain voter rolls and remove anyone who is ineligible to vote.
That includes getting “records of deaths, convictions and name changes from state and Federal agencies,” sharing that information with county election officials, contacting any voters on those lists and canceling a voter’s registration “when statutorily-required conditions are met.” The letter went on to note that state law includes safeguards against prematurely removing a voter from the rolls.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

“Improper cancellation leads to disenfranchisement of an eligible voter. That is why it is a detailed process. It must be certain,” DeMarinis said in the letter. “Maryland’s process errs on the side of removing any doubt in the cancellation before potentially disenfranchising a voter.”
But the Justice Department letter raised questions about the state’s efforts to purge duplicate and ineligible voters — including those who are dead, convicted or undocumented.
The feds’ letter requested voter registration data from November 2022 to November 2024. It also also asked the state to provide “the number of voters identified as ineligible to vote” during that period as a “non-citizen, … adjudicated incompetent” or because they had a felony conviction. Federal attorneys set a 14-day deadline for state officials to provide the information.
DeMarinis said the state was reviewing mailing records cited in the Justice Department letter, but would not be able to meet the two-week deadline to respond. In response to the Justice Department’s request for the state’s current voter registration list, however, DeMarinis said federal officials could download that data on their own, pointing them to the state page on purchasing voter data and the directions to do so.
The state also downplayed the findings of an October 2023 audit of voter roll maintenance by the Office of Legislative Audits, which cited the possibility of double registrations or possibly deceased residents who remained on state voter rolls. State elections officials at the time said auditors exaggerated those claims, and DeMarinis last week pointed to his office’s response to the audit then. That response spelled out the state’s rigorous process of cross-checking registrations that, in the case of duplicate registrations, found “at most a potential 0.00645% rate of duplicates among all active Maryland voter registration records.”
The Justice Department letter was one of two the state received last month, demanding information on voter registration and on state and county election officials efforts to keep the rolls up to date and free of unqualified voters. The second letter, received four days after the Justice Department request, came from lawyers representing a group of local, state and national Republicans who alleged “implausibly high” levels of voter registration, both statewide and in some individual counties.
The GOP letter, directed to the state board and boards of election in Howard and Montgomery counties, threatened to “bring a lawsuit” against the state and local boards “if you fail to take specific actions to correct these violations” within 90 days.
State and local officials said last month that they were still reviewing that letter. But DeMarinis last week, in his letter to the Justice Department, expressed confidence that the system of keeping accurate voter rolls, while protecting the “sacred right” to vote, is sound.
“The State Board works diligently to ensure that every eligible Marylander can register to vote in accordance with federal and state laws,” he wrote. “And as referenced above, election officials in Maryland continue that diligent work to maintain up to date voter rolls.”

When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era Justice Department.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.
Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree that accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023, by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.

ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a recently passed bill to require New York join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.

He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution…. It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

The Kentucky Public Service Commission heard a range of concerns Monday[...],"Kentucky Public Service Commission Chair Angie Hatton listens to public comments from Nick Hart, the water policy director at Kentucky Waterways Alliance, during a hearing Monday in Frankfort. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Kentuckians and local elected officials told Kentucky’s utility regulator a proposal to build several billion dollars of natural gas-fired power generation to meet prospective demand from data centers could burden ratepayers with costs and harm public health and the climate.
The Kentucky Public Service Commission heard a range of concerns Monday inside its Frankfort hearing room about requests from electric utility Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU) to build two gas-fired combined cycle power plants. The utility serves more than 1.3 million electric ratepayers including Kentucky’s two largest cities of Louisville and Lexington. 
LG&E and KU leaders have said the new power plants are needed to meet “unprecedented” projected electricity demand from potential data centers, a trend seen across the country due to a proliferation of data centers supporting services including artificial intelligence. The two power plants, each with a capacity of 645 megawatts, are estimated to cost a combined $2.7 billion when including transmission costs, according to the utility. 
The utility proposed a settlement to the commission last week agreed to by Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman, the Kentucky Coal Association, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers and the Solar Energy Industries Association that would also call for delaying the retirement of a coal-fired power plant unit. The commission could approve, change or deny the settlement. 
A number of Kentucky residents, most from Louisville and Lexington and some representing specific organizations and interests, had strong concerns about the new gas-fired generation. Virginia Bush, who said she volunteered as a faith community nurse at Norton Hospital in Louisville, told the commission she worked with “marginalized people” and was worried the public health impacts of fossil fuels weren’t being considered, specifically particulate matter pollution. She referenced a recent analysis connecting exposure to fossil fuel pollution with an increased risk of dementia. 
​​”These kind of particles into the air and what it costs the public and people privately — emotional and financial — you don’t see these on the bottom line anywhere,” Bush said. “We need to add all of these into the bottom line.” 
Large costs, large concerns

The substantial costs of the gas-fired power plants also played a large role in concerns from public commenters, especially if projected demand from data centers doesn’t materialize. 
Betsy Ruhe, who represents District 21 on the Louisville Metro Council, said she was representing her constituents in her comments, especially many low-income residents who were “already having a hard time paying their utility bills.” 
“Should this go through and LG&E and KU is allowed to build more, there’s going to be higher utility bills,” Ruhe said. “These people are already having their power cut off. We’re struggling to get their bills paid.” 
Felicia Nu’Man, director for the Center of Justice and Policy Initiatives at the Louisville Urban League, told commissioners that ratepayers shouldn’t have to pay for the energy infrastructure servicing “billion dollar tech companies” when people are dealing with medical debt, daycare costs and rising rents. 
The surging power demand from data centers is driving up electricity costs across the country, including in a portion of Kentucky served by electric grid operator PJM. That’s partly because of the immediate demand for energy by data centers and because the costs of new electricity transmission are being passed to ratepayers. 
Liz Pratt, an LG&E and KU spokesperson, in an emailed statement said the utility was committed to making sure all customers including data centers “pay their fair share of utility costs” and that it performs extensive studies to determine “any necessary system enhancements.” 
“New customers, including data centers, would pay for infrastructure located on their property and dedicated to only serving them,” Pratt said.

An LG&E and KU executive Monday pointed to a specific mechanism proposed before the commission that they argue helps protect ratepayers from those data center-driven costs. 
LG&E and KU is proposing to take revenues collected from new data centers to partially and temporarily offset the costs of one of the two proposed gas-fired power plants. The reduced costs for ratepayers would only apply to the new gas-fired power plant proposed at the Mill Creek Generating Station, and the benefit would end when new base rates are implemented by the utility after the new gas-fired power plant is in service. 
“I think it does offer very good customer protections,”  said Lonnie Bellar, an executive vice president for the PPL Corporation, the investor-owned parent company of LG&E and KU. “Our team did a lot of work and had a lot of thoughtful discussions with other companies, trade associations that represent data centers.” 
Bellar said he considers the cost offset mechanism to be “even more protective” of ratepayers’ interest compared to rules implemented recently in Ohio that require data centers to cover at least 85% of predicted electricity costs. 
Pratt, the LG&E and KU spokesperson, in her statement said the interest from data centers “is real, not speculative.” She said the utility’s projected energy demand “remains on pace” with an anticipated load growth of 35-40% by 2032 when compared to 2024. 
“We are actively engaged in substantive discussions with developers and major hyperscale end-users,” Pratt said. 
She said the utility’s tariff schedule proposed before the commission earlier this year is also designed to be “very protective of all customers.” 
Pratt said, hypothetically, a 525-megawatt operation under the proposed mechanism over a required 15-year contract would pay a minimum of $1.4 billion during that time, revenues that would help offset costs of the gas-fired plant.  
Consumer and environmental advocates are skeptical the protection will be enough.
In a press conference outside of the commission’s office, advocates representing groups including the Kentucky Solar Energy Society, the Metropolitan Housing Coalition in Louisville, and the Louisville Climate Action Network questioned why data center revenues aren’t offsetting both gas-fired power plants.
Andy McDonald, the vice-chair of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society, said ratepayers wouldn’t benefit from the cost offset mechanism if data centers aren’t located in the state. 
“We still bear the risk that they will build the gas plants and the data centers don’t appear,” McDonald said. “The protection of this tariff is only protection if the data centers actually get built.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-05 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A Presidential attack on the unhoused,Steve Werlin,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/05/a-presidential-attack-on-the-unhoused/,This Executive Order is a deliberate attempt to reverse hard-won progress and appease those who view unhoused people as a nuisance.,"President Trump’s Executive Order issued July 24 is a shameful, reactionary assault on the most vulnerable members of our communities.
By prioritizing the involuntary institutionalization of unhoused individuals, empowering municipalities to criminalize homelessness, and defunding Housing First and harm reduction strategies, this administration has willfully abandoned the decades of proven, evidence-based public health practices that have helped countless individuals find safety, dignity, and stability.
At Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen (DESK), we have seen firsthand the effectiveness of  Housing First and harm reduction models.  These aren’t abstract theories. They are compassionate, pragmatic strategies rooted in overwhelming evidence and decades of success.  Housing First and harm reduction are about meeting people where they are and providing them with a stable foundation from which they can heal, recover, and rebuild their lives.  They are not only humane; they are demonstrably effective.
In the past year, DESK has deployed these strategies to help more than 800 people in New Haven get connected to housing, shelter, and a variety of other services. Meanwhile our syringe service program has helped reduce the spread of infectious diseases for more than 450 New Haveners, and our naloxone distribution and training program has saved more than 50 lives. Housing First and harm reduction seek to offer immediate stability in which people who struggle with their mental health, suffer from medical ailments, or are dealing with substance use or addiction are better situated to address issues that may have contributed to their lack of homelessness or addiction—including unemployment and underemployment.
By contrast, the Executive Order chooses punishment over support, ideology over evidence, and cruelty over compassion.  Criminalizing poverty and homelessness does not solve these problems; it exacerbates them. Forcibly displacing people through encampment sweeps and warehousing them in institutions without their consent is a failed and inhumane policy that disrupts lives, severs trust with service providers, and, in too many cases, leads to entirely preventable deaths, which is why this type of approach was abandoned nearly half a century ago. Moreover, this administration’s recently passed cuts to Medicaid will further exacerbate these attacks on best practice strategies to homelessness and substance use.
Let us be clear: This Executive Order is not about public safety or health. It is political theater at the expense of human lives.  It is a deliberate attempt to reverse hard-won progress and appease those who view unhoused people as a nuisance rather than as neighbors in need of care and support.
DESK has served the New Haven community for nearly four decades, and we will not be deterred by political maneuvers designed to erase people from public view rather than address the root causes of homelessness.  We will continue to stand with our partners across Connecticut and the nation to advocate for housing, harm reduction, and dignity for all.
We reject this callous policy and reaffirm our commitment to evidence-based, person-centered solutions—not because they are politically popular, but because they work.

Left behind, however, were a series of missed opportunities at precisely the moment when federal actions are compounding the stakes for our students.
Yes, we secured funding for high impact tutoring and continued advancing early literacy. The legislature also made investments in special education and early childcare. These are critical wins for learners.
But major reforms, ones that would unlock access to quality schools, diversify the educator workforce, and strengthen support for multilingual learners, never made it across the finish line. They didn’t fail from disagreement; they stalled in the face of political inertia. Leadership is essential to making change every legislative session, but never more so than in this precarious moment for kids.
With sweeping federal legislation poised to deepen inequity, the urgency to address that unfinished business is now.
Crass congressional cuts threaten to undercut Connecticut’s education gains in profound ways:
Pell grants are reduced, and loan forgiveness programs scaled back, shrinking access to higher education for the students who are investing in their future and need it most.
Funding freezes and program cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other foundational supports will reverberate through schools, jeopardizing mental health services, nutrition, and after-school programming across Connecticut.
In response, our state has rightfully pushed back. Connecticut has filed a lawsuit over the Trump administration’s freeze of more than $50 million in federal education grants. But legal action alone won’t protect the students and families facing immediate loss of opportunity. Local summer learning programs have already been cut. Staff positions are at risk. And entire school districts are being asked to do more with far less, especially when considering macro inflationary pressures.
That’s why the potential for a special legislative session in early fall carries such importance. If convened, education must be at the center of the agenda, not as an isolated issue, but as a pillar in our response to sweeping national challenges.
Here are the most important actions that would help students their families and our state in education: 
Fixing Connecticut’s charter school approval process, which currently blocks new quality schools even when families and communities are ready.
Expanding scholarship opportunities for aspiring educators. 
Modernizing teacher certification, removing outdated barriers and diversifying our educator pipeline.
Expanding language access and opportunity for multilingual learners and their families, whose success strengthens our state both economically and culturally.
We often talk about summer learning loss, but this year, the greater risk is summer leadership loss. We cannot allow urgency to fade just as the stakes have risen. Nor can we separate education from the broader conditions children face, like safe housing, health care, and food security. These are not side issues. They are the bedrock of academic success.
We have a narrow window to act. If lawmakers return this fall, they must come prepared to meet a new reality, one shaped by national retrenchment and guided by the needs of Connecticut families. Then, during next February’s regular session, we must begin with resolve, not reset.
Each session represents a generation of learners. And students don’t get these years back. Let’s use this summer to recommit, not just to finishing the job we started, but to defend the promise of public education in a time when that promise is under real threat.
Our students can’t afford another season of inaction. Neither can we.

That trust is the very foundation of our state’s regulated cannabis program. 
But a recent, quietly issued interpretation from the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) threatens to erode that foundation, raising serious questions about whether consumer safety is being compromised.
The issue stems from a March 6,  email from the DCP’s General Counsel, which stated that cannabis is not considered “adulterated” even if it has been treated with radiation. This technique, often called remediation, is used to kill mold, yeast, and bacteria on cannabis that may have failed initial testing. In essence, it’s a way to clean up a potentially contaminated product after it has already been grown.
On the surface, this might sound like a reasonable safety measure. Who wouldn’t want to eliminate contaminants? But it sidesteps a much more important question: why was the product contaminated in the first place?
Connecticut state law is clear on this point. The law defines a drug as “adulterated” if it contains any “filthy, putrid or decomposed substance” or was “prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions” that could make it harmful. The purpose of this law is to ensure products are clean from the start, not cleaned up at the end. Allowing producers to remediate failed batches with radiation creates a loophole that could incentivize cutting corners on cultivation and handling practices.
Think of it this way: if a restaurant kitchen is repeatedly cited for unsanitary conditions, the solution isn’t to simply douse the finished plates of food with a disinfectant. The solution is to fix the kitchen.
The DCP’s new guidance suggests that a bureaucratic approval for a processing technique can override a clear consumer protection law passed by our legislature. Connecticut’s statutes and cannabis-specific regulations do not appear to grant the department such broad authority. In fact, the commissioner’s discretion is typically limited to very specific circumstances, like authorizing pesticides to prevent a catastrophic crop loss. It was not intended to create a blanket approval for processes that may alter a product that would otherwise be deemed unfit for sale.
This isn’t just a legal debate; it’s a matter of public health and trust. Patients, many with compromised immune systems, rely on the integrity of the medical cannabis program. They deserve to know the history of the product they are consuming —was it grown in pristine conditions, or was it cleaned with radiation because it was initially contaminated?
The current guidance from the DCP creates ambiguity where we need absolute clarity. It puts the burden on consumers to question the purity of their medicine and weakens the very regulations designed to protect them.
Our shared goal must be a safe, transparent, and trusted cannabis program for all residents of Connecticut. To achieve this, we need clear standards grounded in unambiguous statutory authority. Prevention of contamination should always be prioritized over after-the-fact remediation.
Therefore, we call on the Department of Consumer Protection to provide a public, legally sound explanation for its position. It should clarify how an agency-level approval can preempt state law. Ultimately, state regulators must ensure their policies align with the legislative intent of protecting patients and consumers.
Connecticut’s cannabis program was built on a promise of safety and accountability. It’s a promise our state must keep.

Another 500 watched online, to hear years worth of research on water pollutants and key steps forward at the individual, watershed and state levels. 
 One speaker said it was the first step in an effort to keep the report from just “sitting on a shelf.”
“They spent over 4,000 hours on research and compiling data,” former Polk County administrator John Norris said. “Their work now empowers us as citizens and voters to demand action be taken to make our waters safe.”

The Central Iowa Source Water Resource Assessment, or CISWRA, report was commissioned by Polk County two years ago to create an unbiased and comprehensive study of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, which serve as drinking and recreating water for Iowans in the Des Moines area and beyond. 
The Harkin Institute for Public Policy at Drake University gathered four of the 16 scientific advisors who authored the 200-page CISWRA report to present the findings of the report to interested members of the public.

Larry Weber, a University of Iowa professor who worked on the report said water quality issues in Iowa have been going on for a “long long time.” 
But the issue was brought to the attention of many central Iowans this summer when Central Iowa Water Works, which serves 600,000 people in the region, issued its first ever lawn watering ban — not because of a drought, but because the nitrate concentrations in the rivers were too high to meet summer water demands on the system. 
By blocking central Iowans from watering their lawns, Central Iowa Water Works’ facilities were able to keep nitrate concentrations in finished water below the clean drinking water standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. As nitrate levels in the river went down, the utility was able to initiate a phased ending to the ban. 
While challenges to drinking water was part of the report, it also focused on sources of pollution, river flow, recreation, ecological health and suggested solutions. 
Sources and problems: 
The report found that nearly 80% of nitrate contamination in the rivers comes from agricultural sources and that the nitrate pollution in Iowa is uniquely high compared to all other states. 
Weber said part of the problem is the continued addition of tile lines to agricultural land in the watershed. These underground pipes help farmers drain their fields of excess moisture, but can also mean water has a more direct route from field to river, without the filtering effects of percolating through the ground. 
Weber said these problems will also only get worse as the effects of climate change are predicted to include heavier big rain events. 
“The issue that really keeps me up at night is just the lack of progress and the lack of pace in the work that we’re doing,” Weber said. “It doesn’t seem that this issue has ever really garnered the attention that it deserves.” 
Data analysis: How do nitrate levels in central Iowa this year compare to last?

Another researcher, Eliot Anderson who is also at the University of Iowa, said impaired water quality also impacts ecological diversity of a stream. This means fewer fish and macroinvertebrates in the water that indicate a healthy stream. Manure spills, high concentrations of various nutrients and chemicals can kill off these beneficial critters, as can eroding stream banks. 
Anderson said the most “surefire” way to improve the ecosystems is to improve the ecology surrounding a river with buffers of natural vegetation. He said this not only improves the habitat, but also helps keep soil in place and can filter out some nutrients before they reach the river. 
Jerald Schnoor, a professor at the University of Iowa, said nitrates are not the only contaminants that worry water utilities. Algal blooms that can create toxic chemicals, pesticides, ammonia and organic carbon, pharmaceuticals and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, are all source water contaminants that water utilities have to deal with. 
Schnoor said “we really don’t know” what the health effects of all of those things together are, and the potential toxicity of PFAS in very low concentrations is something that concerns him most. 
Claire Hruby, a professor at Drake University who also formerly worked with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, said these are the exact reasons why she chooses to use a reverse osmosis filtration system at her home. 
Hruby said the water quality concerns don’t keep her from recreating in the rivers, however. Hruby said the report found that E. coli is “overall” much higher in Iowa streams than it is at beaches, which are regularly monitored, while streams are not.
“We can’t tell where we are unless we have monitoring,” Hruby said. 
While the report analyzed contaminants like E. coli in the rivers, which she said come not only from ag sources but also from human sources as the river enters urban areas, Hruby said this type of monitoring is limited — as is data for contamination in fish that are caught out of the rivers. 
The majority of efforts to combat nutrient run off from agricultural land, like those under the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, are voluntary programs. Iowa Public Radio’s John Wanamaker hosted a discussion portion of the event Monday and asked researchers if the state had “reached a point” where “regulation is necessary?” 
The crowded theater erupted in shouts of “yes” from the panelists and the audience. 
Hruby said the conversation of regulation is nuanced. She said to enforce any regulation, the DNR needs to be funded to do so. She also said she doesn’t think confined animal feeding operations should be banned, but that there “reasonable changes” to be made. 
“This idea that we can’t talk about it at all is silly,” Hruby said. “We need to be able to talk about it, and what regulations might work.” 
For starters, she said it’s time to “raise the base levels” so that everybody does “something” in terms of conservation efforts that she said are proven to make a difference.

(Allan Swart/Getty Images)A federal judge on Monday night temporarily blocked implementation of a new state law requiring schools to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms that was set to take effect Tuesday. 
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to the law, posters shall be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
Seven multifaith families with children in Arkansas public schools filed the lawsuit in federal court in the Western District of Arkansas in June against the Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs school districts. 
Federal judge says he’ll rule on Arkansas Ten Commandments injunction before August 5

Supporters of the law have said it presents the tenets as a historical document that influenced the country’s founders in the creation of the nation’s laws and legal system. Families who filed the lawsuit argue the law infringes on their constitutional rights to freedom of religion.
In his 35-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks said there is “insufficient evidence of a broader tradition of using the Ten Commandments in public education, and there is no tradition of permanently displaying the Ten Commandments in public-school classrooms.”
Brooks agreed with plaintiffs that Act 573 likely violates their First Amendments rights, and he granted their requested preliminary injunction, which blocks the law from taking effect on Aug. 5 in the four school districts that are defendants in the suit. Brooks also denied motions to dismiss the case by the districts and the attorney general’s office, the latter of which intervened in the lawsuit. 
“Americans today might find it far-fetched to imagine a state establishing an ‘official religion’; but the Founding Fathers were not so sanguine,” Brooks wrote. “James Madison, the author of the Bill of Rights, warned that we should ‘take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties’…That ‘experiment’ is happening now, in Arkansas.”
In a statement Monday night, ACLU of Arkansas Legal Director John Williams called the ruling “a victory for Arkansas families and for the First Amendment.” 
“The court saw through this attempt to impose religious doctrine in public schools and upheld every student’s right to learn free from government-imposed faith. We’re proud to stand with our clients — families of many different backgrounds — who simply want their kids to get an education,” Williams said.
Brooks rejected three arguments raised by the districts and the state for why the case should be dismissed. First, districts claimed that because compliance with the law is dependent on voluntary contributions, the “likelihood of injury is too speculative.” However, according to court documents filed over the weekend, the Fayetteville School District received hundreds of donated posters on Aug. 1.

Second, the state argued the exact content of the displays is unknown, so plaintiffs can’t “reasonably predict the nature and extent of any alleged injury to their constitutional rights,” and must wait until the posters appear. 
Brooks called this argument “disingenuous,” noting the law mandates the exact text and size of the posters. The unknowns are that the displays could be larger than the minimum size or contain extra “historical” information. 
Brooks cited a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, in which parents of public-school children alleged the district’s inclusion of certain books in the English curriculum and the inability to opt their children out of the curriculum violated their constitutional right to free religious exercise. The case supports plaintiffs’ argument in the Arkansas case that there’s no need to “wait and see the context” before seeking a preliminary injunction, he said. 
Third, Brooks rejected the state’s “most intellectually dishonest argument” that the law only mandates “passive” displays that invite no student participation. To support its argument, the state cited a Supreme Court case that found a stone monument of the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds was a “passive” display. 
Brooks said the state “disingenuously omits from its discussion” that the high court noted the placement of the monument on Capitol grounds “is a far more passive use” of the text than another case where the text confronted students every day. 
“Contrary to the State’s contention, the Ten Commandments are not passive because students in public schools are forced to engage with them and cannot look away,” Brooks wrote. 
The Arkansas families allege Act 573 violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
According to Brooks, the Supreme Court has explained that a violation of the Free Exercise Clause depends upon a “showing of direct governmental compulsion” that burdens individual religious belief or practice. The violation of the Establishment Clause depends upon “the enactment of laws which establish an official religion.”
“Act 573 is not neutral with respect to religion. By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library,” Brooks said. “The Act also requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”
Brooks concluded Act 573 is likely to violate the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and be held unconstitutional and that the school districts and state failed to demonstrate they would be harmed if the injunction was granted. 
In his ruling, Brooks noted that 45 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down a Ten Commandments law nearly identical to Arkansas’ law. That precedent remains binding and renders Act 573 “plainly unconstitutional,” he wrote, questioning why Arkansas would “pass an obviously unconstitutional law.”
“Most likely because the State is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms,” Brooks wrote. “These states view the past decade of rulings by the Supreme Court on religious displays in public spaces as a signal that the Court would be open to revisiting its precedent on religious displays in the public-school context.”
Parents have filed lawsuits against laws similar to Arkansas’ in Louisiana and Texas. A federal appeals court blocked Louisiana’s law in June. Plaintiffs in that case are represented by the same counsel as the Arkansas lawsuit.
“Similar laws appear to be in the works in other states, which will lead to more lawsuits — until, it seems, the Supreme Court puts its foot down,” Brooks said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The legislators have left, but the special session of the Alaska State Legislature will continue through at least Aug. 19 as House and Senate majority leaders seek to prevent Gov. Mike Dunleavy from repeatedly ordering lawmakers back into session.
Ordinarily, the Alaska Constitution prohibits legislators from recessing — stopping business — for more than three days. Taking a break for longer than that requires the consent of both the House and the Senate.
On Saturday, after voting to override two of Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s vetoes, legislators passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 101, which would allow the Legislature to take a break for more than three days.
Immediately after the House’s vote on that resolution, Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, called for “reconsideration” — a re-vote — on the issue.
He and all 18 other members of the House’s Republican minority caucus opposed the resolution and wanted to see lawmakers keep meeting in hopes that it would pressure them into discussing education policy changes that Dunleavy has proposed.
Ordinarily, reconsideration takes place on the next legislative day. But because lawmakers aren’t scheduled to meet again until the 19th, it becomes a moot point.
“It’s an interesting problem, right?” Stapp said on Monday. “The real key in the uniform rules (of the Legislature) is enforcement, and I guess the Senate could compel the House to come back,  but they’re not going to.”
Special sessions run for 30 days unless ended early; lawmakers are currently adjourned until Aug. 19 and would have to meet at least once in order to keep the session moving.
Dunleavy told reporters in a news conference on Saturday that he called the special session for lawmakers to address his policy ideas for public education. Some of the governor’s ideas were discussed and voted down during the spring regular session. Dunleavy introduced three bills on Saturday related to tribal education compacting, teacher bonuses and education tax credits, that were referred to committees.  
Members of the House and Senate majority caucuses, which control the legislative agenda, have said they aren’t interested in following the governor’s schedule and will consider education policy via an out-of-session task force that’s scheduled to begin meeting Aug. 25.
Most legislators have already left Juneau, and some are traveling to the annual summit of the National Conference of State Legislatures, taking place in Boston this week. 
Any education legislation would be taken up in the next regular session, which begins in January, members of the majority caucuses said.
If legislators had adjourned the special session on Saturday after voting to override Dunleavy’s vetoes, the governor could have called for a new special session, bringing lawmakers right back into session.
Speaking on the House floor on Saturday, Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, said the purpose of SCR 101 is to prevent Dunleavy from doing just that.
“It’s a maneuver,” he said. “I get it. And it’s something that I would probably do, maybe, if I were sitting in your seat, Mr. Speaker. We all know how politics works. Unfortunately, those of us outside this room don’t know how politics works.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250802-Stevens-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-04 20:56:12.347445

About 60 pregnancies per day in the U.S. end in stillbirth.
The best way to find out why a stillbirth occurred is a fetal autopsy – yet these procedures are performed in only 1 in 5 of the over 20,000 stillbirths that occur each year. As I explain in my recent book, “Stillbirth and the Law,” the fact that so few fetal autopsies are performed after stillbirths is actually a driver of the disproprotionately high number of stillbirths in the U.S.
One major exception to the rarity of fetal autopsies is when pregnancy loss ends with criminal arrest. Arrests after pregnancy loss are not new, but according to data compiled by the nonprofit group Pregnancy Justice, they have increased since the Supreme Court overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion in 2022.
As a legal scholar who studies pregnancy loss and its potential legal implications, I’m struck by this disparity: Autopsies are rare when the goal is general medical insight about the causes of stillbirth and pregnancy loss more generally, but they are seemingly routine when criminal consequences are possible.
Stillbirth and the inevitability myth
In the U.S., pregnancy loss before 20 weeks is called miscarriage, and pregnancy loss after 20 weeks is called stillbirth. Miscarriage is much more common, with some studies estimating it occurs in as many as 1 in 4 pregnancies. Stillbirth is rarer, but the incidence is still surprisingly high. Currently, about 1 in 170 births in the U.S. is a stillbirth, a rate higher than in many other high-income countries.
Moreover, that number masks a dramatic racial disparity. Black women in the U.S. face double the risk of stillbirth compared with white women.

Doctors – and, consequently, their patients – widely assume that pregnancy losses are inevitable. That’s relatively accurate for miscarriages, especially those before 12 weeks, which researchers believe are usually caused by chromosomal abnormalities. But it’s not accurate for stillbirths: Research shows that abnormalities account for fewer than 8% of stillbirths after 28 weeks.
In the U.S., at least 1 in 4 stillbirths are preventable – and that rate is closer to 50% for stillbirths at term, meaning after 37 weeks of pregnancy. Yet there’s been little movement toward prevention. According to a 2020 UNICEF report, the U.S. ranks 185th out of 195 countries in reductions to stillbirth rates from 2000-2019.
The U.S. outpaces other high-income countries in maternal mortality – rates that continue to rise dramatically – and in infant and child mortality. It’s also worth noting that the number of stillborn babies every year in the U.S. consistently exceeds the number of infant deaths from all causes.
The rarity of fetal autopsies
There is no one solution to reducing the U.S.’s stillbirth rate, but gathering data about its causes is a necessary step. A fetal autopsy is widely considered the gold standard for determining the cause of death after stillbirth. The autopsy procedure is extensive, with X-rays, external evaluations of the baby and examinations of internal organs and tissue sampling.
Not only are fetal autopsies extremely rare, but the data from fetal autopsies that do occur is likely not representative. Women with higher levels of education are more likely to get a fetal autopsy after stillbirth. Women with lesser income, however, have double the risk of stillbirth.
One barrier is cost. Many hospitals will not cover the costs of a fetal autopsy. Medicaid does not cover the exam either, and neither do many private insurance companies. Out-of-pocket costs range from $1,500 to $5,000. Stillbirth is surprisingly expensive, and many families understandably choose to use their funds to cover other costs.

The way that doctors bring up the subject of fetal autopsy can also influence whether parents decide on one. Research suggests that parents often do not receive compassionate counseling on this issue. Some parents reported feeling that providers actively discourage them from having one. Providers often lack knowledge about the benefits of fetal autopsy and of the process itself. Doctors’ reactions to stillbirth as a rare, freak event dissuades parents from exploring the cause of their child’s stillbirth and conveys that nothing would be gained from a fetal autopsy.
Finally, there simply aren’t enough qualified pathologists who have expertise in stillbirth evaluation in the U.S. Fetal autopsies are complex. Performing them requires synthesizing knowledge about birth defects, genetic syndromes, maternal effects, fetal development and more. Pathologists must evaluate the placenta and the umbilical cord and factor in maternal health. According to a 2019 report, only 268 out of more than 21,000 pathologists in the U.S. had specialized training in pediatric pathology. And even those pathologists are not guaranteed to have expertise in evaluating fetal or neonatal deaths.
Fetal autopsies’ misuse as criminal evidence
In my view, the rarity of fetal autopsies feeds a sort of vicious cycle. If the cause of a stillbirth is unknown, it opens the doors to suspicion that the pregnant person caused their pregnancy loss.
Overwhelmingly, the women who have been arrested after their pregnancy loss have been from marginalized communities, suggesting that bias also plays a strong role in these arrests. And in these cases, fetal autopsies are common. For instance, authorities conducted one on the fetus of Selena Chandler-Scott in April 2025, when she was arrested after having a miscarriage at 19 weeks. A pathologist concluded from the autopsy that Chandler-Scott did not cause the miscarriage.
Arrests after pregnancy loss have increased after the constitutional right to abortion was overturned in 2022.
More often though, autopsies in such cases are used to conclude that the pregnant person was at fault. There’s every reason, however, to question those conclusions. Fetal autopsies help identify underlying causes of pregnancy loss only when performed by pathologists specifically qualified to perform them. And in many high-profile criminal cases, it’s clear that pathologists lacked the required expertise to assess fetal deaths.
Consider, for example, Rennie Gibbs, who experienced a stillbirth in Mississippi when she was 16. Her baby girl was born with the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck, yet the de facto state medical examiner at the time – who was not a certified pathologist and therefore clearly lacked the needed specialization – concluded she had died due to Gibbs’ cocaine use. Chelsea Becker of California had at least three infections that increase the risk of stillbirth, yet the pathologist, who also lacked the needed specialization, concluded the baby died due to Becker’s methamphetamine use – and later admitted he had never even looked at her medical history.
But it’s hard to rebut these conclusions without building a foundation of research on why stillbirths are happening. Fetal autopsies performed by qualified pathologists to systematically assess the causes of death are a key component of that research – which, I believe, will both help prevent stillbirths and decrease the inclination to blame people who experience pregnancy loss.

In 2023, lawyer Scotti Ramberg admitted — by failing to respond to questions — she tried to take possession of a house without its owner’s permission following a lawsuit that was settled in Missoula County District Court.
Ramberg, the Missoula attorney in the complaints, did not respond Monday to a request for comment.
The Office of Disciplinary Council investigates and prosecutes grievances against lawyers.
Ramberg previously worked as a staff attorney for the Montana Office of the Public Defender. In March 2024, the Office of the Public Defender said Ramberg’s last day as a staff attorney was March 8, but she was working on contract.
Monday, OPD spokesperson Andrea Moore declined to provide Ramberg’s status with the state.
“I’m unable to provide any additional information about Ms. Ramberg’s current involvement with OPD at this time,” Moore said.
The Office of Disciplinary Council filed two complaints against Ramberg dated July 29 that include multiple allegations of dishonest acts. The complaints allege five total breaches of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, which govern the ethical conduct of attorneys in the state.
One complaint includes new details tied to the lawsuit a property owner and his representative filed against Ramberg alleging she filed illegal liens against his home in Missoula after trying to force its foreclosure in a complex scheme.
Sometime after 2005, the owner moved to California into an assisted living facility, leaving the house vacant, the complaint said.
The homeowners’ association filed a lien with the Missoula County Clerk and Recorder for unpaid water assessments in 2007 and a notice of noncompliance in 2017, the complaint said.
In November 2020, the homeowners’ association filed a second lien, which superseded the first, the complaint said.
It said in December 2020, Ramberg formed a couple of limited liability entities to which the homeowners’ association later assigned all interest.
The HOA took action through its lawyer, Rufus Peace, who shared an address with Ramberg, according to earlier reporting by the Daily Montanan.
Ramberg earlier declined to comment on the nature of their relationship and did not respond to a voicemail for comment Monday.
The property owner and representative sued to invalidate the liens and for damages, “as well as for numerous other claims resulting from her unlawful use and possession of the property.”
In the earlier lawsuit, the court found Ramberg admitted she entered the house, changed the locks, took property from the premises, and took possession of the house without permission.
The complaint filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel alleged she violated rules against dishonest conduct numerous times; violated a rule that protects people who do not have legal representation; and violated a rule that prohibits communication with a person known to have a lawyer.
The complaint said in the course of the case, Ramberg conducted an interview with the property owner “despite being aware that J.B. was represented” by counsel.
The rules of conduct prohibit communication by a lawyer with a person who is known to be represented by another lawyer.
The complaint also alleges Ramberg violated a rule that prohibits conduct involving “dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation.”
“Respondent’s explanations surrounding taking possession of J.B.’s property are both inconsistent and unbelievable,” the complaint said.
It said she offered different explanations for taking possession of the property.
It said she filed construction liens for work “she allegedly completed,” but she never provided receipts or documentation, and she never served notice of the liens on the property owner “as required.”
One of the limited liability entities Ramberg formed filed a construction lien for $73,123.13, and another for $36,200.44 against the property.
After the lawsuit had been filed, Ramberg said she had a contract to purchase the house, an agreement “allegedly signed by J.B.” However, the contract was not notarized, the complaint said.
“The terms of the contract are also highly disadvantageous to J.B. Notably, (Ramberg) never produced this document as a defense in the lawsuit,” the complaint said.
It said she swore to the court she didn’t have contact with the property owner and couldn’t serve him notice directly, but once litigation ensued to prevent foreclosure, she found him and interviewed him.
The complaint also said Ramberg submitted a claim to an insurance company for a new roof, which had been replaced in 2014.
However, it said she reported the roof was in good shape in 2021 when she bought the policy, although photos and testimony demonstrate it was in disrepair both before and after.
“Whether she informed the insurance company or failed to correct its misunderstanding, the insurance company paid for a complete roof replacement based upon these statements,” the complaint said.
It said the contract Ramberg produced with the property owner offering to sell her the house “contained terms that were highly unfavorable” to the property owner and highly favorable to her.
It would have Ramberg purchasing the house for less than 22% of its market value, the complaint said.
“In addition, (Ramberg) was allowed to live in the house rent free, indefinitely,” the complaint said. “(She) also indicated that this contract allowed her to rent the property and keep the proceeds.”
The Office of Disciplinary Counsel said she produced no evidence showing she instructed the property owner to seek counsel or inform him she was not a disinterested party, another violation of the rules of professional conduct.
“When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer’s role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding,” the complaint said.
That means not giving legal advice, other than advising the person to get a lawyer, if the lawyer knows or should know a conflict of interest is possible, the complaint said.
The second complaint alleges Ramberg violated a rule that says it is misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on their honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, or to be deceitful.
It said in December 2023, she and her ex-husband participated in a contentious hearing in Missoula County District Court. It said her husband accidentally left his phone and wallet on a table, and she threw them into the trash.
A bailiff retrieved them, and her ex-husband collected them 15 minutes or so later.
Roughly one month later, Ramberg asked a security guard if the court had recorded the incident on camera, and the guard confirmed it had, the complaint said.
“(Ramberg) described the incident to the security guard, indicated that the video would incriminate her, and asked him to delete the recording,” the complaint said.
It said Ramberg then said she was “joking” and walked away.
In April 2024, the Missoula County attorney accused Ramberg of misdemeanor theft of lost or mislaid property, and Ramberg was found guilty in a bench trial and did not appeal, the complaint said.
The complaint said Ramberg admitted to throwing away the wallet and phone, admits to the conversation with the guard, although said she was joking, and admits to the charges and conviction, but said she was “not in her right mind” at the time.
Ramberg has the opportunity to respond to the complaints, and a hearing with a panel of the Commission on Practice is possible.
Should the Commission on Practice find the allegations warrant disciplinary action, it could recommend a range of punishment, from a public admonition all the way to disbarment.
The Commission on Practice makes recommendations to the Montana Supreme Court, which oversees the body and issues the decisions on discipline.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-103300237-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-08-04 20:56:12.347445

The new owner, an Indiana-based competitor, is in the process of stabilizing the financially troubled company that owes millions of dollars to a variety of international, national and local vendors.

When Gardener’s Supply filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late June, it owed its vendor Green Mountain Mulch over $81,000. Over a month later, Daniel St. Onge, the owner of the mulch dealer, said he, nor most Gardener’s vendors, is likely to fully recoup what they’re owed
“It ain’t looking good. I think it’s gonna be cents on the dollar, if anything,” St. Onge said. “It’s definitely a hurt and that’s for sure. … It was quite a shock actually. I do a lot of business with them and didn’t really know nothing until the day of.” 
As of July 31, the once popular employee-owned Vermont gardening business was acquired by Indiana-based competitor, Gardens Alive!. Following the finalization of the sale, it’s the company’s employees and suppliers who are being hit particularly hard, as Gardener’s still owes international, national and local vendors hundreds of thousands of dollars and some workers are to be laid off.
St. Onge said Gardens Alive! has begun the process of restarting business with Gardener’s former vendors. But according to court documents, Gardens Alive! will not be liable for any debt, legal claims or liens against Gardener’s related to its bankruptcy.
“I’m in the process of speaking on that with them,” he said. “Had a little email chatter today about it and they’re supposed to talk to me tomorrow.”Alongside vendors, workers at Gardener’s Supply are also facing upcoming layoffs following the sale, as first reported by Courtney Lamdin of Seven Days.The Vermont Department of Labor confirmed the layoffs, which will primarily hit Gardener’s  Milton warehouse location and call center. Vermont Department of Labor spokesperson Rachel Dumeny told VTDigger that the department could not yet specify how many workers are set to be laid off, citing pending legal approval of the company’s layoff notice.Dumeny wrote in an email that the department will be providing a free information session for laid off workers on Wednesday at Gardener’s Milton warehouse to discuss unemployment benefits, health insurance and re-employment opportunities.Gardener’s employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) also doesn’t appear to be in good standing. The plan has now lost its independent trustee — the Washington-based ESOP Trust Company — meant to steward the trust through bankruptcy.Court documents show that the trust company, once meant to “navigate the (employee stock ownership plan) through the pending bankruptcy and corresponding asset sale,” has resigned, citing “persistent post-petition breaches” of its agreement with Gardener’s.The breaches include failures to both pay legal fees and comply with various fiduciary and reporting obligations, according to court filings.
Gardener’s bankruptcy counsel said it would not pay the $100,000 it previously agreed to pay the trust company to steward the ESOP during the bankruptcy process.
Unless Gardener’s has enough money left over after the sale, workers in the ESOP plan may not see a dime, according to Matt Cropp, executive director of the Vermont Employee Ownership Center.“So in a situation like this, the company’s got a bunch of outstanding debts and obligations — payroll, the trade invoices, secured debt, unsecured debt, all of those things, right? Then equity is usually at the bottom of the stack,” he said. “So the question for this sort of thing would be is there a residual amount and, if so, then there’s some fraction of it that would be distributed pro rata amongst folks depending on their shares.”Gardener’s Supply declined to comment.

Alabas Farhat take a picture on Jan. 14, 2025 | Anna Liz NicholsThe leader of the Michigan House Democratic caucus asked Republican leadership to reinstate state Rep. Alabas Farhat of Dearborn to the chamber’s appropriations committee after a political falling out saw him ousted, but in a letter sent Monday, House Speaker Matt Hall said that was out of the question.
Farhat was the minority vice chair on the powerful House Appropriations Committee until late last month when House Republicans failed to muster enough votes to pass the chamber’s version of a school cell phone ban and major changes to life-without-parole sentencing guidelines for 19- and 20-year-olds.
Hall, a Republican from Richland Township, was adamant in public statements following the vote that he had deals with House Democrats to push the bills across the finish line in a bipartisan fashion, only to have those deals broken when every House Democrat voted against the measures.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The fallout from the cell phone ban bill, sponsored by state Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester), has given way to another battle of wills between the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-led Senate. It also resulted in Hall kicking Farhat off his seat on the appropriations committee, further deepening the chasm between minority Democrats and the leaders of the House GOP.
Hall said weeks ago that he was interviewing replacements for Farhart, but Puri had asked Hall to bring the Dearborn representative back into the fold.
In a letter sent to Puri on Monday, Hall punted that idea square across the playing field.
“Representative Farhat has demonstrated an inability to represent your caucus and work in good faith to pass key, bipartisan legislation and a school budget that prioritizes students over special interests,” Hall said of his reasoning. “This appointment is arguably the most important role for any House Democrat during this period of divided government. It’s vitally important that it is filled with someone who can help Governor Whitmer and I deliver a final budget by September 30th.” 
Hall reiterated that he was interviewing and speaking with Democratic members, seeking a replacement who “demonstrates the ability to secure buy-ins from your caucus when making commitments.” 
“If you would like to recommend another member who can represent House Democrats in this position, I will take it into consideration,” Hall said, before recounting his side of the story on why Farhat was ejected. “The events leading up to Representative Farhat’s removal last week are clear to us all. He was planning to support the commonsense legislation that was brought up for a vote – including priorities for the governor as well as Wayne County – but ultimately voted no after a long public argument with you and your leadership team.”
Hall said it was his view that Farhat’s “change of heart came even after we agreed to approve his amendment to one of the bills and agreed to pass other bills sponsored by his fellow Democrat members.”
“I have negotiated several successful deals while serving in the Legislature, and the governor and I have shown an ability to work together and forge a productive relationship. We know how this is supposed to work,” Hall added. “Legislative Democrats would benefit from following the lead of Governor Whitmer instead of clinging to the negative governing philosophies that resulted in yours being the only caucus in the nation to completely lose control of their chamber last year.”
8.4
The speaker had previously told Puri and House Democrat that he didn’t need them to pass a budget and that their participation depended on how much they were willing to engage with his caucus. Hall, however, certainly needed House Democrats at least twice to help get bills over the finish line, once on a failed attempt to amend the Senate’s education with one of several substitute bills, and the kerfuffle that saw the first go at a school cell phone ban shrivel in the House last month.
Still, Hall warned in his rejection letter that if Puri and House Democrats wanted to play a meaningful role in the remaining term, “it must begin by demonstrating a willingness to engage in good faith and prioritize real results over political maneuvering.”
“Michiganders expect their elected officials to lead with integrity, stand by their word, and put the public interest ahead of partisan gamesmanship,” Hall said.
When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Puri’s office told Michigan Advance that the minority leader’s and Farhat’s previous statements on Hall’s own maneuvering and perceived gamesmanship were evergreen.
Farhat, speaking to reporters after he was removed from the appropriations committee on July 24, called Lansing and the state of the Legislature “a f******* mess.”
“Unequivocally. That’s what it is,” Farhat said. “If you look at my legislative history as who I am … every single bill was bipartisan last year. [I am a person] who worked 19 substitutes to get Republicans the support of a Public Safety Trust Fund, who went out of his way to make sure we incorporated voices that mattered at the table, because I believe when you govern, you want to govern through consensus.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Facetune_14-01-2025-17-59-44-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 20:56:12.347445

The gubernatorial appointment, which deals with civil rights for incarcerated prisoners, has drawn the ire of progressives in the state for removing representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union, who previously sat on the council.
Flint works for Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy organization.
The letter to Gov. Greg Gianforte reads as a response to a separate letter penned by Disability Rights Montana to Gianforte last week.
That letter, signed by a number of organizations and some Democratic lawmakers, asked for council work to stop until someone with “appropriate experience” was appointed.
The Criminal Justice Oversight Council was created by the Montana Legislature in 2017 and consists of 18 members — four legislators and 14 appointed members representing various parts of the criminal justice system.
The council’s job is to study and recommend solutions to issues in the state’s criminal justice system and work with the legislature.
Monday’s letter in support of Flint is signed by Montana’s entire Republican federal delegation as well as more than 40 Republican legislators.
Statewide officials signed the letter as well, including Attorney General Austin Knudsen, State Auditor James Brown, Clerk of the Supreme Court Bowen Greenwood, and State Superintendent Susie Hedalen. 
Several members of the council — Alan Doane, Jimmy Patelis and Ross Canen signed on to the letter as well.
“Mrs. Flint is a highly qualified and diligent advocate whose experience and integrity have earned broad respect among those who value genuine protection of rights and public safety in Montana,” the letter reads. “We respectfully address the concerns raised recently by some Democrat lawmakers and various liberal advocacy organizations regarding this appointment, and we affirm your decision to appoint Mrs. Flint, who is highly qualified and brings a fresh, competent perspective to this critical role.”
The letter says Flint is a State Government Relations Manager for ADF and has had roles with U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, and former U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg. She also briefly worked for the Office of Public Instruction.
The ADF is not known for its prison advocacy work. The ACLU, however, is, and the civil rights organization had one of its members in what’s now Flint’s seat since the council’s inception eight years ago.
“The concerns raised about replacing the ACLU overlook the organization’s well-documented partisan political activity,” Monday’s letter read. “The ACLU has consistently supported Democrat candidates through significant financial contributions and voter mobilization efforts, often prioritizing issues that closely align with Democratic Party platforms.”
The ADF’s only major work with incarcerated people seems to be around religious literature in prisons and where transgender people are housed in prisons. The ADF has not responded to multiple interview requests, including to speak with Flint. 
The letter, however, paints a picture of what role the ADF could play in state policy.
“ADF’s advocacy, particularly in protecting female privacy and safety, addresses a critical civil rights issue within Montana’s criminal justice system,” Monday’s letter reads. “ADF has championed the rights of women in prisons who face privacy and safety violations when housed with men. The ACLU, however, has opposed such protections, prioritizing a radical gender ideology over the safety concerns of female inmates.”
The ACLU disagreed with the letter’s assertions.
“The ACLU of Montana is a nonpartisan organization that does not endorse candidates,” ACLU of Montana said in a statement Monday. “For decades we have been advocating for the health, safety and welfare of all individuals who are caught up in the criminal justice system, regardless of race, sex, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.”
Monday’s letter made specific references to the ADF’s stance on transgender people in prisons, which last year the organization called “radical.”
Federal changes in policy toward transgender people are changing. Federal laws under the Obama and Biden Administrations sought solutions to problems transgender people face in prison, particularly sexual assault. Transgender people face much higher rates of sexual assault in prison.
A large-scale study, administered by the federal government, found in 2015 that 37% of transgender inmates were sexually assaulted during a one-year period, compared with 3.4% of cisgender people surveyed.
The Trump administration has canceled grants related to the Prison Rape Elimination Act Resource Center, which some advocates have worried sends a broader message about the federal legislation that created it. 
The Prison Rape Elimination Act is federal law from 2003 that was passed in an attempt to cut down on sexual assault rates in prison. The ACLU was heavily involved with work surrounding the PREA. 
It’s unclear how many transgender people are incarcerated in Montana, though the state does have a committee to place transgender and intersex prisoners.
Flint appears to have some interest in this issue, and met Riley Gaines a former competitive swimmer and outspoken anti-trans advocate with a national platform. Gaines was testifying for a Montana law. 
Jessica Flint’s husband, conservative talk radio host Aaron Flint, has also made recent statements on his social media regarding incarcerated people, though it was unclear if his values lined up with those of his wife.
“The ACLU claims they protect the rights of the incarcerated, yet they want to trample on the rights of incarcerated women by forcing them to be imprisoned with men proven to assault them,” Aaron Flint wrote on July 25.
Additionally, the letter said Jessica Flint’s appointment could bring reform.
“Mrs. Flint’s appointment brings to the Council a perspective equipped with strong constitutional grounding and a demonstrated ability to address complex public policy matters,” the letter reads. “We applaud this forward-looking decision and are confident Mrs. Flint’s leadership will result in policies and reforms that truly serve all Montanans.”

Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.

“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
DOJ plans to ask all states for detailed voting info

The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.

Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
 Undermining the Electronic Registration Information Center,

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
Idaho Secretary of State removing 36 likely noncitizens as registered voters, says some voted

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.

Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
 ‘A total shock’

In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
Republicans scrutinize voting rolls and ramp up for mass challenges ahead of election

The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

(Photo via Homeland Security Investigations/Government Accountability Office)A bill to strengthen border security and expand opportunities for agents involved in the Shadow Wolves Program is advancing through Congress, as the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted to move it forward.
The Shadow Wolves Improvement Act is sponsored by U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), and it passed the committee unanimously on July 30.
The Shadow Wolves are an elite unit within the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agents are members of the Tohono O’odham Nation who patrol the 76-mile stretch of land the Nation shares with Mexico.
Since 1974, the Shadow Wolves have utilized traditional tracking methods to assist in disrupting and dismantling drug and human trafficking organizations, according to the tribe.
“Despite their critical role in border security, Shadow Wolves currently lack the same career advancement and compensation opportunities as other Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents,” according to Gallego’s office.
The legislation reclassifies Shadow Wolves as competitive service employees, giving them greater career mobility, improving retention, and making it easier to recruit new agents.
“The chaos at our southern border has harmed Arizona communities and caused a dangerous rise in illicit smuggling, especially on tribal lands like the Tohono O’odham Nation,” Gallego said in a press release.
He said the dangerous rise has stretched tribal law enforcement thin and diverted them from their primary jobs of policing their streets, which is why the Shadow Wolves program is so important.
The Shadow Wolves Improvement Act codifies key recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to enhance and expand the Shadow Wolves program, permitting ICE to change Shadow Wolves from excepted to competitive service status after three years.
Gallego commended the support of the bill’s co-sponsors, U.S. Senators John Hoeven (R-ND), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), and James Lankford (R-OK).

  James Robertson. (Provided/SC Department of Corrections)
James Robertson’s attorneys will appear in federal court in Charleston to argue the details of whether or how Robertson himself should tell a judge why he wants to drop his appeals. He’s unsuccessfully made that request twice before.
Robertson was convicted in 1999 of killing his parents, Terry and Earl Robertson, using with the claw end of a hammer, a baseball bat, and a knife. Prosecutors said Robertson, 24 at the time, killed them two days before Thanksgiving of 1997 in an attempt to get his part of a $2.2 million inheritance.
In March, 51-year-old Robertson wrote a letter to U.S. District Judge Timothy Cain saying he had asked his attorney to withdraw his appeals. Robertson’s attorney refused, saying it would be unethical for her to clear the way for a client’s execution, Robertson wrote.
“We have a difference of opinion as to what is in my best interest and it is unlikely that either of us will cede,” Robertson wrote.
The hearing Tuesday is before federal Magistrate Mary Gordon Baker. The next step could be Cain’s courtroom.
If allowed to drop his appeals, Robertson would be the ninth in the state to do so since executions resumed nationwide in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Jeffrey Motts, whose 2011 execution was the last carried out in South Carolina before an unintended 13-year hiatus, waived his appeals to face the death chamber. A circuit court and the state Supreme Court decided Motts was competent to waive his appeals process after questioning him in person. Already serving two life sentences for murder, Motts received the death penalty for fatally strangling his cellmate at Perry Correctional.
Six inmates have been executed since the state resumed the process last September.
The arguments
Attorney Emily Paavola, who works for nonprofit Justice360, stood by her decision in legal filings. Robertson only wanted to withdraw his appeals because he was depressed, in large part because several of his friends had recently been executed, Paavola wrote.
Unlike in other legal processes, defendants don’t have a constitutional right to defend themselves during appeals, Paavola wrote.
A person’s bid for self-representation must be “knowing and voluntary,” meaning they understand the full consequences of what may happen, she continued. A judge must first decide whether a person is competent to make that decision, Paavola wrote.
Robertson is not, Paavola argued. She noted Robertson has previously said he wants to waive his appeals before changing his mind and continuing the process.
In those cases, the courts didn’t conduct a thorough mental health evaluation, according to Paavola’s filing.
“Given Robertson’s history, this Court should permit the assessment of his mental health by experts retained by appointed counsel that the state courts twice eschewed,” Paavola wrote.
An evaluation would uncover Robertson’s history of mental health issues, Paavola wrote. As a teenager, Robertson received treatment for bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which escalated to an involuntary hospital stay at age 23, according to the filing.
At Robertson’s 1999 trial, his attorneys argued he attacked his parents after crushing and snorting too much of the ADHD drug Ritalin, claiming that triggered a psychotic episode. Prosecutors dismissed that idea, noting how he planned their deaths.
Robertson has a history of suicidal thoughts and depression, which in the past led to his attempts to end his appeals process and be executed, Paavola wrote. Often, Robertson’s depression is linked to what’s happening in his life, such as events in his legal proceedings, personal losses or health struggles, she wrote.
Robertson also receives medication for his depression, and his mental health issues typically come after he stops taking his medication, Paavola wrote.
“In all prior instances, the common denominator is this — when his mental health issues are not properly medicated, Robertson falls into a deep depression,” Paavola wrote. “The inverse is also true — when his depression is well-controlled (and/or the situational problems are remedied), Robertson has repeatedly and consistently reversed his position.”
For the past three years, Robertson has not been taking his medications. He also has back pain and a chronic skin condition, both of which have worsened his mental state. Those personal struggles have come amid the state’s renewed executions, Paavola wrote.
The executions of six men in eight months have taken a toll on Robertson. He had gotten to know everyone who was taken to the death chamber during the decades they shared in prison, but he was especially close with Marion Bowman, who was executed Jan. 31.
The state Attorney General’s Office argued that Robertson was able to make his own decisions and should be allowed to proceed as his own attorney if he chooses. Robertson was declared competent to receive the death penalty, and that decision should stand, attorneys for the state wrote.
Expert evaluation
Robertson understood the decision he was making and its consequences, wrote an attorney appointed by a judge to evaluate his case. Whether his decision was voluntary, though, was more complicated, attorney John Warren wrote.
Legally, a voluntary decision to withdraw appeals can’t be based on a person wanting to escape difficult circumstances in prison, expert attorney John Warren wrote. The recent spate of executions, along with the requirement that all other inmates spend the time before them locked down, made it difficult to judge whether Robertson’s decision was truly voluntary, according to his filing. Warren declined to weigh in on the issue of competency.
Because of the conflicting factors, Robertson’s was a “unique and uncommon situation,” Warren wrote. He suggested either having a mental health expert evaluate Roberton or asking his psychiatrist to weigh in on his mental state, as well as holding a hearing at which Robertson can plead his case directly to the judge.
Robertson requested that the judge schedule the hearing as soon as possible so as not to prolong the process, Warren wrote.
“To that end, Mr. Robertson is resolute in his decisions, but is also mindful of the Court’s duty to ensure that he is competent and that his waivers of counsel and federal review are knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.”

Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District became the fifth GOP candidate to enter the 2026 governor’s race Monday, saying she’s running “to hold the line.”
Mace, the first female cadet to graduate from The Citadel, officially launched her campaign during an early morning event at her alma mater. She has been teasing an impending bid for months on social media and talking to voters across the state to prepare for an announcement.
“They said stay quiet. I spoke up. They said sit down. I stood up. They said play nice, and I fought back,” Mace told about 100 supporters gathered in the courtyard of Capers Hall at the state’s military college.

“I’m running for governor because South Carolina doesn’t need another empty suit,” she continued. “It needs a governor who will fight for you and your values.”
She pointed to her years at The Citadel as giving her “the courage and discipline I’d need to take on life’s toughest battles,” noting she entered the Corps of Cadets after dropping out of high school at age 17 and initially going to work at Waffle House. She graduated in 1999, three years after The Citadel changed its male-only admission policy for cadets.
“That’s where I learned what it means to hold the line — no matter the pressure, no matter the odds,” she said.

Mace joins an already crowded field for the primary. Republicans who have already announced bids over the last month are Attorney General Alan Wilson, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, and most recently, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of Rock Hill.

Attacks and accusations

While the 47-year-old single mother only just made it official, she has been sniping at the competition, both on social media and in front of voters.
Mace has taken shots at Evette as a “glorified ribbon cutter” who only smiles and waves.
“She’s a nice lady,” Mace wrote on social media in June. “No edge. No guts. No shot.”
But Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as South Carolina’s top prosecutor, has been the primary focus of Mace’s criticism. At the start of the year she began calling Wilson a “do-nothing attorney general.”
Then in February, Mace took to the House floor and accused four men, including her ex-fiancé, of “some of the most heinous crimes against women imaginable” during a nearly hour-long prepared speech.
The congresswoman said she discovered thousands of photos taken with hidden cameras as well as recordings the “predators” made of themselves sexually assaulting women over years. She was among the victims.
The State Law Enforcement Division confirmed after her speech that it was investigating at least one of the men for assault, harassment and voyeurism. The investigation started Dec. 14, 2023, after SLED was contacted by U.S. Capitol Police.
Mace also accused Wilson of not addressing the crimes against her and other women.
All four men accused have denied the accusations and one has sued for libel and defamation.

Wilson said neither he nor anyone in his office had any knowledge of the accusations until her speech. It also is not the attorney general’s job to start a police investigation, his office said in a statement.
Since then, Mace has sued one of the other men for defamation. And a woman, identified as Jane Doe, who says she was a victim of three of the men has filed her own civil suit.
All of those lawsuits are ongoing.

Mace’s political career

Mace unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2014. She placed fifth in that seven-way GOP primary, which Graham won without needing a runoff.
In January 2018, she won a special election to the South Carolina House representing parts of Charleston and Berkeley counties. She replaced a GOP legislator who resigned amid a yearslong Statehouse corruption investigation.
In 2020, Mace ousted one-term Democrat Joe Cunningham for the 1st congressional seat, flipping the district back into Republican control. The district was then redrawn as part of the Legislature’s redistricting process following the 2020 census to favor a Republican and Mace easily won re-election with more than 58% of the vote.
Mace won her last GOP primary with the endorsement of President Donald Trump. But during her early days in Congress, the two had a rocky relationship.
Mace condemned Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol and was among House Republicans who voted to impeach him in the aftermath. In her first re-election bid, Trump backed her GOP challenger, though Mace ultimately won that primary.
She’s since become one of Trump’s most fervent allies.
“I think that anyone that wants to run statewide or any election, really, in 2026 or 2028 beyond, will need the President’s support,” Mace previously told reporters.

A firebrand

Her first campaign ad touts her “firebrand” reputation and includes Trump calling her “a fighter.” On Monday morning, she didn’t directly talk about Trump, but her fiery speech focused on his policies, including immigration.
She promised to fine businesses that hire immigrants living in the U.S. illegally $1,000 a day and work closely with federal immigration officers to round up “illegals who are flooding our state.
“Anyone who is here illegally will get deported immediately,” Mace said.

 1st District race
Mace’s announcement that she’ll run for governor creates a second opening in South Carolina’s congressional delegation.
State Rep. Mark Smith told the SC Daily Gazette on Monday that he will run to replace Mace.
“The Lowcountry needs a proven leader in the 1st Congressional District and I’m ready to step up,” the Daniel Island Republican wrote in a statement.
Voters first elected Smith, CEO of McAlister-Smith Funeral Homes, in 2020 to the state House seat previously held by Mace.
Last week, GOP state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill announced he’s running for the 5th District.


She promised to sign a “bathroom bill” into law, saying “mentally ill men don’t belong in women’s spaces.” She didn’t give specifics. But South Carolina already has such a law for K-12 public schools, which remains in place pending a final ruling on a challenge in federal court.
She also promised to rid libraries of what she termed “pornography” and ban the use of pronouns in classrooms.
“I want kids coming home with A’s and B’s not they and them,” she said.
State law already restricts children’s access to sexual books in public libraries, as per a state budget directive proposed by Kimbrell, one of her GOP primary opponents. A separate state regulation in effect since June 2024 bars books with sexual conduct from public school libraries and classrooms. The latest decisions by the State Board of Education brought to 21 the total number of books librarians have been required to remove from shelves.
Her message resonated with supporters at the 7:30 a.m. event, many of them waving “Hold the Line” signs or wearing “Get Maced” stickers.
“I’m a sixth-generation Charlestonian and I’d like to see a woman in the governor’s office,” said Francis Beylotte. “Men in South Carolina have messed it up forever. … I think she has the character and experience now. She’s paid her dues, and it’s justified.”
In 2010, then state Rep. Nikki Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, became South Carolina’s first female and first minority governor. Her departure in 2017 to become Trump’s first United Nations ambassador put then-Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster in the governor’s office. Having won two full terms since, McMaster is South Carolina longest-serving elected governor. He can’t seek a third.
“We need change in South Carolina,” added Jenson Estey of Daniel Island. “Kind of like President Trump — change up the norms.”
Mace was introduced by Kaitlyn Czuar, whose 10-year-old son Tanner was one of three people hit by a car during a May 1 hit-and-run on Sullivan’s Island. Mace awarded Tanner the Congressional Patriot Award for his courage in the wake of the incident.
Kaitlin Czuar said Mace is “someone who understands that protecting families and defending children isn’t political – it’s a priority.”
Czuar said Mace “notices people. She hears them and she stands with them. She’s a trailblazer and a servant leader who puts South Carolina families first.”

More controversy

Mace has made headlines for her conflicts with multiple transgender people.
It began with the election last November of Delaware’s Rep. Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress. Mace introduced a resolution to ban transgender women from using women’s restrooms in the U.S. Capitol and House office buildings, later seeking to expand that to all federal property.

She was then criticized for using a slur to the LGBTQ community during a House Oversight Committee hearing in February.
In April, Mace got in a conflict with a transgender student at the University of South Carolina when the student asked Mace to apologize for using the word “tranny” during an April event hosted by USC’s chapter of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative viewpoints on high school and college campuses across the country.
Following that exchange, an Upstate transgender woman threatened on social media to kill Mace. The woman was arrested and charged with threatening the life of a public official. That case is still pending.

Town hall series announced

Ahead of officially launching her campaign, Mace also announced a statewide series of speaking engagements that her team is calling “the Mother of All Town Halls,” starting in Myrtle Beach Wednesday.
“No questions off limits, no topics too tough,” Mace’s spokeswoman Sydney Long said in a statement to NBC affiliate WCBD News 2 . “She’ll be traveling across South Carolina to speak directly with residents.”
Mace has previously been criticized for not holding in-person town halls, including a profanity-laden conflict with a man in an Ulta Beauty store who questioned her for her lack of events.

Extended permits for Dell Creek and Forest Park feedgrounds give state wildlife managers more time to complete long-range plans, Bridger-Teton supervisor says.
The post Feds OK 3 more years of Wyoming elk feeding in Hoback Basin where CWD ‘epidemic’ hit appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming wildlife managers will be permitted to throw hay for at least three more winters at two disputed elk feedgrounds, one of which is the site of a chronic wasting disease epidemic that bodes ill for the future of elk populations and hunting. 
Bridger-Teton National Forest Supervisor Chad Hudson made the call to issue a 3-year permit for the Dell Creek and Forest Park elk feedgrounds. His decision, made in the wake of litigation, was “difficult,” “complicated” and not taken lightly, he wrote. 
“Feeding as part of winter elk management in western Wyoming is an emotive and controversial issue, and for good reason,” Hudson wrote in a July 30 decision document that accompanied a final environmental impact statement. “No alternative, with or without feedgrounds, is without tradeoffs and consequences to wildlife, resources, and people.”
The option the Bridger-Teton landed on for the 35-acre Dell Creek and 100-acre Forest Park feedgrounds will allow for continued operations through the winter of 2027-’28. After that, the national forest would again study permits for all seven feedgrounds within its 3.4 million acres, effectively delaying a long-term decision.

One Bridger-Teton feedground, located up the Gros Ventre River drainage at Alkali Creek, has already been phased out.
Elk feeding is historic in northwestern Wyoming, having begun more than a century ago on the National Elk Refuge. Dell Creek and Forest Park are both at least 45 years old. Proponents say it’s necessary to insulate elk herds from the effects of bad winters, prop up populations and keep wapiti away from cattle. But feeding also spreads disease, contributes to the loss of migration routes and is considered an antiquated wildlife management practice that’s been abandoned elsewhere in the West.
The permit for the Dell Creek Feedground expired in 2022. The Forest Park site’s permit lapsed in 2018. Feeding since then has been authorized via one-year special use permits.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department sought a 20-year permit, a request that Hudson denied. Another option the Bridger-Teton weighed would have only allowed elk feeding on an emergency basis. A fourth avenue would have ceased all feeding immediately. In its environmental impact statement assessing the four “alternatives,” the Forest Service did not select a “preferred” option. That fell to Hudson last week.
Forest Service officials enlisted U.S. Geological Survey research biologists to help make a decision that accounted for the spread of CWD, an always lethal prion disease. In a 2023 analysis, disease experts predicted that continuing feeding would produce the worst outcomes for elk populations and elk hunting.
In the two years since that analysis, CWD was documented on the actual footprint of a few feedgrounds for the first time. It especially flared up on and near the Dell Creek Feedground, where six elk tested positive for the degenerative neurological disease, according to Hudson’s decision.

Because of how CWD spreads, some disease experts worry that prevalence is about to skyrocket.  
“Most of the time [prevalence] just goes straight up,” Wyoming State Wildlife Veterinarian Sam Allen told WyoFile last winter. “I would expect it in this population to go a little bit faster than in some of our other elk populations, considering how feedgrounds are set up.”
An average of 571 elk amassed at the Dell Creek Feedground’s 35 acres over recent winters, according to Game and Fish’s elk feedground management plan. In and of itself, that plan doesn’t compel any reforms, but it does call for herd-specific “Feedground Management Action Plans” that could result in major changes or even phasing out feedgrounds — although only if there’s a consensus to do so.
Even though elk feeding is continuing at the site for at least three more winters, some plaintiffs who have challenged the practice in court see Hudson’s decision as a “welcome” move. 
“It’s a step in the right direction that signals the Forest Service is beginning to take the chronic wasting disease crisis seriously,” said Dagny Signorelli, the Wyoming director for Western Watersheds Project. “Obviously, we would like to see the agencies phase out these feedgrounds immediately and permanently.”

SNAP is not a wasteful program – it is our nation’s first line of defense against hunger. It is a trusted and proven program to support our most disadvantaged residents in putting nutritious food on the table.
The post SNAP cuts are an abdication of our shared moral responsibility appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE RECENTLY PASSED One Big, Beautiful Bill Act has led to the largest federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid in history. Proponents have claimed that this bill will reduce waste and fraud. With the USDA reporting that over 98 percent of those receiving SNAP benefits are wholly eligible, and payment errors are down significantly, this is a claim based on politics, not facts.
This bill reduces or eliminates benefits for seniors, veterans, children, legally present immigrants, and working families. The tightened work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries put approximately 175,000 Massachusetts residents at risk of losing benefits.
For decades, SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, has enabled low-income families and individuals to put food on the table. Today, the program supports 1 in 6 Massachusetts residents, and 1 in 8 people across the country, providing them with the purchasing power needed to achieve food security and have the consistent access to nutritious meals that everyone deserves. 
Estimates for cuts to Medicaid show that over 325,000 people will lose their health insurance in Massachusetts over the next 10 years, putting them at risk of hunger and dependent on emergency food pantries. Medicaid is a critical lifeline that makes the basic need of health care accessible to low-income families, and cuts to this program only deepen their struggles, forcing more families to choose between paying for medical care and putting food on the table. 
Basic human needs such as food and health should never be politicized. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what has happened. SNAP is not a wasteful program – it is our nation’s first line of defense against hunger. It is a trusted and proven program to support our most disadvantaged residents in putting nutritious food on the table.
Now, our most vulnerable neighbors will face a manmade crisis that will unfold over the course of several years. By diminishing SNAP and Medicaid benefits, we know more people will turn to an already overburdened charitable food pantry system. We believe this will be at a scale that will far exceed its capacity. The Greater Boston Food Bank’s network of over 600 food distribution partners is already struggling to keep up with demand as one in three Massachusetts residents face food insecurity, exacerbated by one of the highest costs of living in the country.
These vital programs help our neighbors; people we all know. SNAP supports families like Jessie’s, who were forced to move to be closer to Boston hospitals when her two children were diagnosed with an extremely rare genetic condition, leaving her job behind. “I drained every savings account I have had to survive,” she says. “It has been a full-time, unpaid job to coordinate medical appointments and transport my kids to different doctors. I wish more people knew that their neighbors living with food insecurity are not lazy. Most people don’t want to rely on benefits.”
Alongside new restrictions comes a vilified caricature of SNAP beneficiaries – one that paints them as lazy people who refuse to work and seek out loopholes for assistance. In reality, these are hardworking people, our neighbors, people we see going to work every day to feed their families and themselves. Among food insecure households in Massachusetts that do not report being disabled or retired, 82 percent are working households, with 66 percent working full-time jobs. Of the employed households that experience food insecurity, 32 percent report having two or more jobs.
Supporting the wellbeing of people like Jessie and her family is our moral responsibility, and food insecurity is a solvable problem that, when left unaddressed, comes with immeasurable costs. It manifests in a growing number of our neighbors – even those who fit the bill of hardworking Americans – making unimaginable trade-offs between other necessities like housing, health care, medication, childcare, heat and electricity, and transportation.
We are fortunate to live in Massachusetts, a state whose elected leaders value food as a human right. The Healey-Driscoll administration has established a statewide Anti-Hunger Task Force, a public-private partnership seeking to prevent hunger, and mitigate the impact of recent cuts to SNAP and Medicaid. It is charged with identifying lasting, structural solutions to make hunger history.
The recently approved state budget also included historic hunger-relief investments that support the Massachusetts Emergency Food Assistance Program, essential to fulfilling our mission as a food bank to our community partners; Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the Healthy Incentives Program; and School Meals for All (making us one of only 13 states with this program), among other Initiatives.
As supportive of hunger relief as Massachusetts is, the requirement to make up for federal funding cuts will strain our state, economy, and charitable food system. In 2028, a particularly detrimental provision of the federal cuts will go into effect, dictating that individual states will be forced to make up for federal funding gaps to meet the need. Transferring the costs of SNAP to the state creates a financial burden that most states simply cannot shoulder.
Nonprofits like the Greater Boston Food Bank will need to fundraise to close the gap, and private philanthropy alone will not be enough to bridge such a significant change in federal policy. We estimate an increase in demand at food pantries could be as high as 55 percent, and an additional $98 million would be needed statewide to purchase more food to meet this anticipated demand. The question is – with so much need, and federal support rapidly dwindling – how can our social safety net continue to put meals on the table for the millions of Massachusetts residents facing hunger?
Through the Anti-Hunger Task Force, we will continue to collaborate with lawmakers and hunger-relief partners to find creative solutions to the hunger crisis and continue to do what we do best – providing our community with access to healthy food.
Food is a human right, not a waste of money. It is our collective responsibility to make this basic need accessible to all our neighbors.

“We’re trying like everybody else to understand impacts as the changes are coming down,” said the coordinator of a prominent program helping migrant workers access health care.

Medicaid cuts and other elements of the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” will restrict access to health insurance for noncitizens in Vermont in 2025 and 2026. 
Even though some noncitizens will avoid the worst impacts, the confusion alone could inhibit them from accessing care, people working to provide health care for immigrants say. 
“There’s a lot of Vermonters with a whole range of different immigration statuses, and they are the people who are putting on our roofs and helping milk our cows,” Mike Fisher, Vermont’s health care advocate, who helps people navigate the health care system, told VTDigger. “It’s so disheartening to see an attack on their access to health care.”
State health officials shared their predictions of how many immigrants will lose health coverage in the next year and a half, even as they emphasized that the exact implications of the latest federal cuts are still unknown. Medical providers and advocates helping immigrants access health services told VTDigger they’re already seeing patients eschew care due to the bureaucratic complexity and fear of the Trump administration’s federal immigration enforcement. Advocates predict the health system’s administrative burden will only become worse in the months ahead.  
In a hearing with legislative leaders last week, Jenney Samuelson, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Human Services, shared the state’s latest predictions on the scope of the federal cuts impacting immigrant health care. 
She said an estimated 100 undocumented residents who have been in the country fewer than five years are slated to lose health insurance premium assistance on Jan. 1. The state also expects 400-500 refugees, asylum seekers and nonlegal residents to lose the same assistance at the turn of the year, she said.

Between 500 and 600 Medicaid enrollees who are asylum seekers or refugees are expected to lose eligibility in October 2026, Samuelson told lawmakers.
The increased administrative burden associated with the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” will make it more difficult for noncitizens to access health care, said Naomi Wolcott-MacCausland, program coordinator of the Bridges to Health program, which helps migrant workers access health services.
“Health insurance can be really complicated for anybody, regardless of whether you speak English or don’t have access to the internet,” she said in an interview, and the federal changes will only add to those challenges.
A patchwork of federal and state programs allow some noncitizens with a range of immigration statuses to receive health care. 
In Vermont, the Immigrant Health Insurance Plan allows pregnant individuals and young people not otherwise eligible for Medicaid to enroll in health insurance. 
But many immigrants go without coverage. 
One barrier to insurance, according to Wolcott-MacCausland, is that it is challenging for many immigrant workers to estimate their incomes because industries like agriculture or construction can boom or bust due to uncontrollable factors like weather. 
As the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” causes health insurance subsidies to shrink or disappear altogether, Wolcott-MacCausland said, the changes will disproportionately affect immigrants and those with variable incomes. She said she already sees many workers on temporary visas who are eligible for insurance choose not to enroll due to concerns that their fluctuating income will lead them to owe more money than they expect. 
Federal cuts to services for noncitizens are not the only changes in Washington, D.C., affecting access to health care. Wolcott-MacCausland said increased federal immigration enforcement is causing people to fear going to the doctor. 
“People are delaying care that can in turn result in them being at a really costly emergency department visit,” she said. 
Open Doors Clinic, a free clinic in Middlebury serving uninsured and under-insured local residents, including migrant and immigrant workers, is seeing fewer new patients, according to Julia Doucet, the clinical and program director. She said she is also seeing patients who are choosing to return to the countries where they were born. 
While health workers are already seeing people change their behavior, the full scope of new federal policies is still coming into focus.
“We’re trying like everybody else to understand impacts as the changes are coming down,” Wolcott-MacCausland said. “There’s a lot of unknowns.”

A Mississippi Today investigation into suffering, secrecy and the business of prison health care


Susie Balfour, diagnosed with terminal breast cancer two weeks before her release from prison, has died from the disease she alleged past and present prison health care providers failed to catch until it was too late. 
The 64-year-old left the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in December 2021 after more than 30 years of incarceration. She died on Friday, a representative for her family confirmed.   
Balfour is survived by family members and friends. News of her passing has led to an outpouring of condolences of support shared online from community members, including some she met in prison. 
Instead of getting the chance to rebuild her life, Balfour was released with a death sentence, Pauline Rogers, executive director of the RECH Foundation.
“Susie didn’t just survive prison, she came out fighting,” Rogers said in a statement. “She spent her final years demanding justice, not just for herself, but for the women still inside. She knew her time was limited, but her courage was limitless.”
Last year, Balfour filed a federal lawsuit against three private medical contractors for the prison system, alleging medical neglect. The lawsuit highlighted how she and other incarcerated women came into contact with raw industrial chemicals during cleaning duty. Some of the chemicals have been linked to an increased risk of cancer in some studies.  
The companies contracted to provide health care to prisoners at the facility over the course of Balfour’s sentence — Wexford Health Sources, Centurion Health and VitalCore, the current medical provider — delayed or failed to schedule follow-up cancer screenings for Balfour even though they had been recommended by prison physicians, the lawsuit says.
“I just want everybody to be held accountable,” Balfour said of her lawsuit. “ … and I just want justice for myself and other ladies and men in there who are dealing with the same situation I am dealing with.”
Rep. Becky Currie, who chairs the House Corrections Committee, spoke to Balfour last week, just days before her death. Until the very end, Balfour was focused on ensuring her story would outlive her, that it would drive reforms protecting others from suffering the same fate, Currie said.  
“She wanted to talk to me on her deathbed. She could hardly speak, but she wanted to make sure nobody goes through what she went through,” Currie said. “I told her she would be in a better place soon, and I told her I would do my best to make sure nobody else goes through this.”
During Mississippi’s 2025 legislative session, Balfour’s story inspired Rep. Justis Gibbs, a Democrat from Jackson, to introduce legislation requiring state prisons to provide inmates on work assignments with protective gear. 
Gibbs said over 10 other Mississippi inmates have come down with cancer or become seriously ill after they were exposed to chemicals while on work assignments. In a statement on Monday, Gibbs said the bill was a critical step toward showing that Mississippi does not tolerate human rights abuses. 
“It is sad to hear of multiple incarcerated individuals passing away this summer due to continued exposure of harsh chemicals,” Gibbs said. “We worked very hard last session to get this bill past the finish line. I am appreciative of Speaker Jason White and the House Corrections Committee for understanding how vital this bill is and passing it out of committee. Every one of my house colleagues voted yes. We cannot allow politics between chambers on unrelated matters to stop the passage of good common-sense legislation.”
The bill passed the House in a bipartisan vote before dying in the Senate. Currie told Mississippi Today on Monday that she plans on marshalling the bill through the House again next session. 
Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, said Balfour’s case shows that prison medical contractors don’t have strong enough incentives to offer preventive care or treat illnesses like cancer.  
In response to an ongoing Mississippi Today investigation into prison health care and in comments on the House floor, Currie has said prisoners are sometimes denied life saving treatments. A high-ranking former corrections official also came forward and told the news outlet that Mississippi’s prison system is rife with medical neglect and mismanagement. 
Mississippi Today also obtained text messages between current and former corrections department officials showing that the same year the state agreed to pay VitalCore $100 million in taxpayer funds to provide healthcare to people incarcerated in Mississippi prisons, a top official at the Department remarked that the company “sucks.”
Balfour was first convicted of murdering a police officer during a robbery in north Mississippi, and she was sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction in 1992, finding that her constitutional rights were violated in trial. She reached a plea agreement for a lesser charge, her attorney said. 
As of Monday, the lawsuit remains active, according to court records. Late last year Balfour’s attorneys asked for her to be able to give a deposition with the intent of preserving her testimony. She was scheduled to give one in Southaven in March. 
Rogers said Balfour’s death is a tragic reminder of systemic failures in the prison system where routine medical care is denied, their labor is exploited and too many who are released die from conditions that went untreated while they were in state custody. 
Her legacy is one RECH Foundation will honor by continuing to fight for justice, dignity and systemic reform, said Rogers, who is formerly incarcerated herself.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/04171821/123_1-2.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 18:56:24.489909

(Contributed photo)Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley is seeking the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District seat, making next May’s primary a four-way race at this point.
Pinsley said he’s determined to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie. The Republican  defeated Democrat Susan Wild in 2024. She served three terms representing Carbon, Lehigh, and Northampton counties and part of Monroe County.
Mackenzie, who has aligned himself with President Donald Trump and the GOP’s positions on inflation, immigration and abortion, is a target for Democrats hoping to win back a majority in the U.S. House next year.
“I’ve been fighting against Trump and MAGA’s irresponsible policies as Lehigh County Controller, and I’m ready to keep fighting as your Representative in Congress,” Pinsley said in a statement. “The country is in chaos — and we can’t put it out by cowering in the corner. MAGA extremists are attacking our freedoms. Billionaires are rigging the economy. And too many Democrats are watching it happen like it’s business as usual. I’ll take on the forces that are selling out the American people.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pinsley, who made an unsuccessful bid for state auditor general in 2024, joins an already crowded field seeking his party’s nod to challenge Mackenzie.
Longtime Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure was first to announce a plan to take on Mackenzie in February. Carol Obando-Derstine, who worked as an aide to former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, joined the race in May. 
And former federal prosecutor Ryan Crosswell, who resigned from the Department of Justice after Trump demanded it drop the bribery case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, entered the race in June.
Pinsley said he has demonstrated his commitment to opposing the Trump administration’s cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, health care for veterans, nutrition for infants and other benefits to assist older and vulnerable people.
“I’ve spent my life working for actionable results to help my fellow Pennsylvanians build better lives,” Pinsley, a U.S. Army veteran, said. “In Congress, I’ll continue to defend democracy, provide for those in need, and oppose Donald Trump’s authoritarianism rule from day one.”
If elected, Pinsley said he would support legislation to provide universal health care, lower prescription drug prices, protect Social Security and to vitiate the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that opened the door to unlimited political spending by corporations.

Pinsley said he would also demand greater congressional oversight of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which received an unprecedented funding increase in the budget reconciliation bill Trump signed last month.
He also said he would work closely with fellow lawmakers, but added he would call for Democratic leadership in the House, Senate and DNC to step down “if they can’t, or won’t, put an end to Trump’s corruption in office–and stop his radical GOP policy agenda from moving forward.”
Recent federal campaign finance filings for the second quarter of 2025 show Mackenzie leading his early Democratic challengers with $800,000 raised. In the same period, Crosswell raised $320,000, Obando-Derstine raised just under $210,000 and McClure raised just over $85,000.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — The Nebraska State Auditor is taking aim at the state office that manages probation services for lawbreakers — alleging that an “extraordinary” spike in state costs was at least partly spurred by scant oversight.
Released Monday, a 41-page report by Auditor Mike Foley examined the Nebraska Administrative Office of Probation. A division of the Nebraska Supreme Court, the probation office supervises roughly 16,000 Nebraskans who broke the law, including about 5,500 youths and adults who receive specific court-ordered services.

According to Foley, expenses of probation services jumped to roughly $62 million last calendar year — an increase of about $19.5 million from two years earlier.
The “cost explosion,” he said, was driven by programming for juveniles convicted of crimes. Such services include psychiatric and substance abuse treatment, family support, transportation and community youth coaching.
While juveniles comprise about 20% of all those on probation, Foley said, they account for about 88% of the cost of all probation services provided in Nebraska.
 Potentially ‘millions’ at stake

Based on his team’s findings, Foley believes that potentially “millions of dollars” were paid by the AOP for services he contends could have been covered by other sources, such as family, private insurance, Medicaid or another federal pot.
“It is the intent of state law to promote parental responsibility and to provide for the most equitable use and availability of public money,” the report said. 
To help fulfill that intent, it said, sentencing courts are supposed to consider the earnings of a household and availability of other income sources and, when appropriate, direct them to contribute.











My office’s latest audit work shows much room for improvement, as there has been for many years, when it comes to efficient fiscal management.


– Mike Foley, Nebraska State Auditor



Foley contends that the AOP provided inadequate oversight and did not provide necessary financial information to judges.
He said running the probation program for juvenile, county and district courts is “unquestionably a difficult and often thankless task.” He noted that many findings remained unfixed since a similar state audit a decade ago.
“My office’s latest audit work shows much room for improvement, as there has been for many years, when it comes to efficient fiscal management,” Foley said.
Foley told the Nebraska Examiner that he can’t direct the hand of the AOP or Supreme Court, but can draw attention to what he sees as inefficiencies. He said part of the solution is educating judges.
“When you order all these fancy services, stop for a moment and say, ‘Who’s gonna pay for that?’” said Foley. He said the “irritating” part to him is that “victims” of crime often end up paying for services via tax dollars. 
 Probation responds

The report included a response from the AOP, saying it will work to improve internal policies and procedures. 
The AOP did point out, however, that in determining a household’s ability to pay, its staff does not have access to the same financial information used by the auditing team from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.
Its leadership said it will contact DHHS and other state entities to determine the feasibility of reviewing such data and also to address potential payment issues.

Foley said shortcomings went beyond access to DHHS records and alleged a lack of adequate policies and procedures.
Gene Cotter, state probation administrator, on Monday added that his staff was appreciative of the auditor’s work and said that through the process, his office was able to fix an automated process that led to duplicate payments.
Cotter, who was appointed to the office earlier this year, said his team has made strides in addressing flaws highlighted in previous audits, including redesigning a voucher processing system. 
“Be assured, all financial resources received from the Legislature have been used to increase community safety,” he told the Nebraska Examiner.
Cotter said that while juveniles represent a smaller fraction of the overall probation population, state statutes require funding a“full continuum” of programming which has led to financial aid for pricey services including out-of-home placements, detention and community-based treatments.
Additionally, he said, the Legislature increased juvenile service provider rates by 20% over the past three fiscal years and the number of youths receiving probation services rose by about 25% in fiscal year 2023.











Be assured, all financial resources received from the Legislature have been used to increase community safety. 


– Gene Cotter, Nebraska probation administrator



When performing the review, the audit team looked at a sample of 48 payment vouchers totaling about $523,000 for services. 
Foley said the sample pool showed that probationers were not required to pay “a single dollar, despite evidence that many of them or their families had the monetary means to cover some, if not all, of those expenses.”
Other highlights
Among other findings alleged:

State statute authorizes the probation office to collect fees from adults on probation for electronic surveillance, drug tests and a monthly programming fee. According to the audit, 38% of $2.6 million in such charges were collected last year. It said the courts waived about $968,000, and another $650,000 remains outstanding.
Four vouchers reviewed showed a total of $10,494 in services provided that allegedly weren’t court-ordered and lacked documentation to show need by the individual.
The probation office allegedly made seven duplicate payments totaling $9,370 during 2024.
In one case, the AOP authorized nearly $800 for a juvenile offender’s care in a group home during a period in which the home said the youth had run away.
In four instances, services for probationers who were wards of the state totaled nearly $225,000 and might have been required to be paid by federal funds through DHHS.
One court-ordered probation service that could last 45 days was paid for 118 days without authorization.
In about half the cases reviewed, the probation office allegedly did not update the financial needs of probationers, as regulations require.

(Photo by Erin Reed)A coalition of 15 state attorneys general have filed a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s effort to restrict access to medically-necessary care for transgender, intersex, and nonbinary youth.
The lawsuit challenges recent federal action to deter doctors and medical providers from offering gender affirming care to youth under the age of 19 years old, including states where that care is legal and protected.
Joining the suit are the attorneys general of Michigan, New York, California, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
“The Trump administration shouldn’t be interfering with the provision of health care,” said Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul in a statement Friday. “The administration should be respecting individual liberty and equal rights, not shamefully targeting transgender people.”
The attorneys general have asserted that President Donald Trump’s White House is overstepping its authority, using threats of criminal prosecution and federal investigations to pressure health care providers.
“The Trump Administration is attempting to strip away lawful, essential healthcare from vulnerable youth. These orders are illegal and dangerous and have no medical or scientific basis,” said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in a statement. “I will continue to protect families, defend doctors, and stop politicians from putting our kids’ lives at risk.”
Trump in the beginning of his second administration signed an executive order stating that the U.S. would only recognize two sexes, and called for an end to what Trump labeled “gender ideology.” A second order focused on medical restrictions, directing the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue enforcement actions related to that care.
Since then, Nessel’s office said the Department of Justice has issued subpoenas to providers under the guise of criminal law enforcement, but the attorneys general filing the lawsuit Friday argue those efforts lack legal standing and are intended only to intimidate.
“Health care decisions for kids should be made by parents and doctors, not by politicians,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group, in a statement. “The federal government is using funding as a weapon to force providers to abandon their patients and override parents’ rights to make health care decisions for their own children.”
Patricia Wells, a doctor and the medical director of The Corner Health Center in Ypsilanti, Michigan, said in a statement that she and her colleagues are distressed by new punitive changes to funding and regulations, which threaten to dismantle essential care.
“These policies do not protect children; they endanger them,” Wells said. “They undermine trust in the medical system and place affirming providers in an impossible position, forcing hospitals to close clinics and providers to stop offering the very care that helps young people survive and thrive.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr has filed a brief in support of a lawsuit against Savannah Mayor Van Johnson over a local ordinance aimed at penalizing gun owners who leave firearms in unlocked cars, escalating an ongoing feud between Georgia’s top prosecutor and the mayor of the state’s oldest city.
The lawsuit stems from an ordinance that was unanimously passed by Johnson and the Savannah City Council in April 2024, requiring firearms to be “securely stored” when left in cars and establishing a maximum penalty of $1,000 in fines and 30 days in jail for people who leave them inside unlocked vehicles. It also mandates that those who have had a firearm stolen report the theft to the Savannah Police Department within 24 hours.
“This misguided attempt to punish law-abiding Georgians does absolutely nothing to address crime, and it won’t hold up in Court,” Carr said in a press release Monday. “No matter how much the Mayor disagrees with our laws, he cannot openly infringe on the Second Amendment rights of our citizens. Progressive politics aren’t a defense for government overreach.”
Savannah city officials hoped that by mandating that gun owners lock their cars, they could cut down on the number of firearms stolen. According to police data, 203 of the 244 guns stolen in cars in 2023 were in unlocked vehicles. 
But the ordinance drew the ire of Republican state legislators during the 2025 legislative session, who tried unsuccessfully to pass a bill allowing recipients of Savannah’s gun storage fine to sue the city for up to $50,000 in damages – though that was later lowered to $25,000 when the proposal was added to another bill. That measure remains alive for next year. 
Carr, who is a candidate for governor next year, also sent a letter to Savannah officials warning that the city had overstepped its authority in passing the ordinance.
“Because the General Assembly has expressly designated the regulation of firearms as an issue of general, state-wide concern, no local ordinance can regulate firearms,” Carr wrote in the letter.
Less than a month after the ordinance was passed, Jesup resident Clarence Belt filed a lawsuit challenging the city’s ordinance. However, Chatham County Superior Court Judge Benjamin Karpf ultimately dismissed the case for lack of standing, as Belt was not a resident of Savannah and had not been cited under the law. Belt’s lawyer, John Monroe, is now representing Deacon Morris and the Firearms Policy Coalition in a new lawsuit against the city, in which Carr has filed an amicus curiae.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A bipartisan group of U.S. senators, including Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, introduced legislation recently to improve a federal conservation program with changes including a higher maximum annual payment for landowners.
The Conservation Reserve Program pays farmers and ranchers to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and maintain grass, trees and other plant species on enrolled acres, which helps prevent soil erosion, filters runoff that enters waterways, and establishes habitat for wildlife. Landowners may be allowed to conduct livestock grazing, haying and seed-harvesting on the land.
“I’m proud to lead this commonsense legislation that would help advance the multiple-use benefits of this conservation program, including wildlife habitat and livestock forage potential,” said Thune, a Republican, in a news release.
The Conservation Reserve Program Improvement and Flexibility Act was introduced by Thune, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minnesota.

The bill would increase the annual payment limitation from $50,000, which was established in 1985, to $125,000 to account for inflation and rising land values. It would also provide cost-share funds for the establishment of grazing infrastructure, like fencing and water tanks, on all contracts where grazing is included in the approved conservation plan; expand a program that helps landowners plant trees and create wetlands on enrolled acres; and more easily allow enrolled acres to be hayed in drought conditions. 
“When land sits idle, it doesn’t just go unused, it declines, and so do the small towns and rural communities that depend on active land management,” said Warren Symens, president of the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association, in the news release.
Wildlife conservation groups praised the bill as well, anticipating the changes would result in more acres enrolled in the program. Andrew Schmidt, director of government affairs for Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever, said in the news release that the bill “will make this critical program work better for farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and wildlife.”
As of last year, Conservation Reserve Program contracts encompassed nearly 2.4 million acres in South Dakota. Annual program payments in South Dakota totaled $137 million, with an average payment per acre of $57.40.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/134582_1761314559239_5592405_o-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-08-04 18:56:24.489909

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Corn across the state is a couple of days ahead of schedule, with 53% of corn acres reaching the dough stage and 9% entering the dent stage according to the latest crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Eighty-nine percent of soybean acres have bloomed across the state and 65% have set pods as of the July 28 through Aug. 3 reporting period. 
Both crops continue to rate well, with 85% of corn and 80% of soybeans rated good to excellent. 
LaVon Griffieon, who runs a diversified operation with her family outside of Ankeny, said the conditions have been “nice” this year. 
“But the problem is, it’s nice all the way from Nebraska to Indiana,” Griffieon said. “It’s going to be hard to market this much corn.” 
USDA figures compiled by the National Corn Growers Association show an estimated 5% more corn in the ground this year than last, meaning the crop this year is on track to be the “largest on record.” 
USDA also projects a $4.20 per bushel farm price for corn in the 2025/2026 marketing year, which is down from this year and the previous year.

Hay and pasture continue to rate well across the state, both rated more than 80% good to excellent for the reporting period. 
Most farmers have wrapped up the second cutting of alfalfa hay and 39% of alfalfa hay acres across the state have had a third cutting. Oats are ready for harvest across the state, with 64% of acres already harvested. 
Soil moisture conditions were similar to the week prior with 31% of topsoil and 27% of subsoil rated surplus for the reporting period. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, Iowa continued to see above-average precipitation, with parts of the state receiving between 1 and 3 inches above the normal. 
A derecho swept through parts of northern and eastern Iowa July 28, with wind speeds up to 99 miles per hour recorded. According to Glisan’s report, there were two “spin up” tornadoes in the same storm that damaged some crops in Lyon County. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for Buena Vista, Cerro Gordo, Clay, Dickinson, Lyon, Palo Alto and Worth counties to help with damages from the storm systems. 
Later in the week, temperatures dropped to 5-10 degrees below average, and smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted across the state causing hazy skies and degraded air quality.
The average precipitation for the week was 2.18 inches, which was more than double the normal, according to Glisan. The average temperature for the week was 71 degrees, just 1.5 degrees below normal.

Dan McKee isn’t ready to walk off the court just yet when it comes to potentially hosting the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team.
The Boston Globe reported Saturday that former Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca’s PagsGroup wants to relocate the WNBA team from Uncasville, Connecticut, to Boston’s TD Garden by 2027. The deal has a record-smashing $325 million price tag attached, plus $100 million for a new training facility, the Globe reported. 
The deal would transfer the team from its current owners, the Mohegan Tribe, but it still needs to be approved by the WNBA and its board of governors. But a statement Pagliuca posted Sunday evening to X has fueled speculation that Rhode Island could still be involved in some capacity.
“An investor group led by PagsGroup, and supported by Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee, has offered to acquire the Connecticut Sun with the objective of keeping New England’s WNBA team in New England,” Pagliuca wrote. “No transaction has been agreed yet.” 
McKee spokesperson Laura Hart sent a statement Monday, identical to the one she had previously sent media outlets over the weekend when news of the possible Boston deal first broke. 
“We have made our interest to work with the team known and are open to future conversations about a potential role for Providence,” Hart wrote.
McKee toured the AMP (Amica Mutual Pavilion) last month with a then-unnamed investor team. WPRI-TV, who first reported the tour, wrote on Monday that it was Pagliuca’s team who had toured the AMP with McKee on July 11. 
Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey reposted the Globe story to her X account and noted that the Sun had recently played their second sold-out game at TD Garden. 
“The fans are here. The energy is here. All we need is a team,” Healey wrote. “This would be a great opportunity for the players, for the WNBA, and for Massachusetts.”
WNBA teams play 44 regular-season games, plus playoffs and an in-season tournament. If moved to Boston, the Sun’s schedule could occasionally conflict with TD Garden’s other occupants, the Celtics and Bruins. That could leave Providence’s AMP as the temporary locale for some games.  
Meanwhile, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont is backing an alternate bid to keep the team in Connecticut. That deal is being brokered by a group led by Marc Lasry, the former co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, and would see the Sun transported to the PeoplesBank Arena in Hartford, about a 45 minute-drive from the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville. The Hartford Courant reported Monday that the Lasry deal also exceeds $300 million and would include money for a training facility.
A WNBA statement to the Globe emphasized that nothing final has been decided: “Relocation decisions are made by the WNBA Board of Governors and not by individual teams.” 
“As part of our most recent expansion process, in which three new franchises were awarded to Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia on June 30, 2025, nine additional cities also applied for WNBA teams and remain under active consideration,” the statement continued. “No groups from Boston applied for a team at that time and those other cities remain under consideration based on the extensive work they did as part of the expansion process and currently have priority over Boston.” 
Pagliuca wrote on X that his group will continue to work with the WNBA as the process “unfolds.”
“Our offer is subject to obtaining the required league approvals, as is the case for all such transactions,” Pagliuca wrote. “This approval has not been obtained thus far, and we cannot proceed without it. We will respect, cooperate with, and abide by all league rules and decisions on these matters. As passionate basketball fans and strong believers in women’s professional sports, we remain excited by this opportunity and would be honored to serve as the next stewards of this franchise, if the transaction can be approved.”
For now, though, the Sun has told season ticket holders that the team will stay in Mohegan Sun Arena through 2026. The team sold out of season tickets for the first time in May.

,California,2025-08-04 22:02:21+00:00,CalMatters,"2,300 California ‘Dreamers’ are about to lose their health care coverage",Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/dreamers-lose-health-insurance/,The Trump administration has reversed a rule that allowed undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as kids to buy health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.,"In summary
The Trump administration has reversed a rule that allowed undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as kids to buy health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.


Less than a year after “Dreamers” were first allowed to sign up for Covered California health insurance, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children are about to lose their health care coverage.
In California, that means about 2,300 Dreamers must find health insurance elsewhere or go without once their coverage is terminated at the end of the month. The decision was made by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees insurance marketplaces.
Last year, the Biden administration updated the definition of “lawfully present” for Affordable Care Act eligibility so recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), also known as Dreamers, could buy insurance through the state and federally run marketplaces. The Trump administration reversed that decision in June and set the change to take effect two months later.
The policy is “designed to stabilize the risk pool, lower premiums, and reduce improper enrollments with a goal of improving healthcare affordability and access while maintaining fiscal responsibility,” the agency said in a statement announcing the marketplace changes.
Last week Covered California announced it was working to notify all DACA recipients that their last day of coverage will be Aug. 31 and that it will help them explore other insurance options.
Since its inception, the Affordable Care Act has barred immigrants living in the country illegally from purchasing health coverage on the marketplace. DACA recipients, who are allowed to stay and legally work in the U.S. under a 2012 program, became the exception. 
‘Hoped for a different outcome’
“The decision is deeply unfair to hard-working, tax-paying individuals in California who trusted that they would have health insurance for 2025, only to have it stripped away eight months later,” said Jessica Altman, the executive director at Covered California. “While we had hoped for a different outcome for DACA recipients, we must comply with federal law.”
Without the insurance marketplace, Dreamers will have to find coverage through an employer, or if their incomes are low enough, they may qualify for the state’s health insurance program for low-income people, Medi-Cal. That leaves freelancers and self-employed Dreamers, for example, in a bind if they earn too much to qualify for Medi-Cal but not enough to pay full price for a health plan.
The benefit of signing up for insurance through Covered California is accessing financial assistance. Expanding coverage to DACA recipients nationwide was estimated to cost the federal government between $240 million to $300 million a year.
Effect on the marketplace
While the federal government said the cuts are meant to stabilize the insurance risk pool and help lower premiums, experts say eliminating coverage for young people — most Dreamers are under 36 years of age — would do the opposite.
That’s because when younger and healthier people sign up for insurance, their low-cost coverage helps balance the high cost of covering individuals who are sicker and older, said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.
So when fewer young people enroll in coverage, premiums tend to go up for everyone. “Then sick people who really need to get coverage pay the price,” Vargas Bustamante said. 
The 13-year-old DACA program does not grant recipients legal status, but it does protect them from deportation and allows them work authorization. More than 150,000 DACA recipients are estimated to live in California.
President Joe Biden’s move to insure DACA recipients through the marketplaces was immediately met with resistance from red states. Last summer a group of 19 Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to stop the insurance marketplace expansion to DACA recipients. A federal judge in North Dakota sided with the plaintiffs and stopped the rule from going into effect in those 19 states. The new rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services applies to all states. 
DACA recipients are the first group of a larger number of immigrants who are expected to lose or drop marketplace coverage soon. The federal budget President Donald Trump approved last month eliminates marketplace financial assistance for some lawfully present immigrant groups, including refugees and asylees, starting in 2027. Without financial assistance many of these enrollees will likely not afford their coverage.
Meanwhile, everyone else enrolled in a Covered California plan could see their monthly premiums go up by $101 a month starting next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/012825_Dreamers-LA_AJ_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-04 18:56:24.489909

Act 624 of 2025 would have banned pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. Four PBMs and a national organization representing them filed four lawsuits against Act 624 that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas combined into one case.
U.S. District Judge Brian Miller ruled that Act 624 “likely violates” the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause and is “likely preempted” by a veterans’ health care program. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office appealed Miller’s ruling Thursday.

Evan Nelson_Orders_Express Scripts, Inc. et al. v. Richmond et al. 25-520_Express Scripts, Inc_ 
Both plaintiffs and defendants asked Miller to stay the case until the appeal is decided. Miller issued two identical orders Monday granting the request.
The case is expected to go to trial in light of Miller’s injunction. No trial date had been set as of Monday.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. Three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, all of whom sued Arkansas over Act 624 — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a July 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.
The other two plaintiffs against Act 624 are the Navitus Health Solutions PBM and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.
In his ruling, Miller agreed with the plaintiffs that Act 624 “appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies.” He also agreed with Express Scripts’ claim that Act 624 impedes its mail-order pharmacy’s requirement to provide prescription medication to members of the military, their families and veterans in Arkansas. ESI Mail Pharmacy Inc. is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.
Supporters of Act 624 have said the law is necessary to ensure patients’ access to prescription medications, particularly for patients who live in rural areas or need highly specific drugs. Lawmakers, state insurance department officials, independent pharmacists and the Arkansas Pharmacists’ Association have repeatedly claimed that PBMs financially strain independent pharmacies by violating the state’s existing laws to regulate their behavior.
Act 900 of 2015 requires PBMs to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, and two 2018 laws prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)A new Idaho legislative task force is wading into the complicated and emotional territory of child custody laws with the possibility of making changes. 
The Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force has met twice since the Legislature adjourned for the year, and co-Chairs Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said the group came about because of complaints from constituents. 
“Our purpose here is to study how child custody and family laws are being interpreted and applied by Idaho courts,” Nichols said at the first meeting on July 7. 
  Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, works from the Senate floor on the morning of March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Nichols said the group of lawmakers will look into recommending changes to the state’s laws to “provide courts and citizens with more clarity.” 
Scott told the Idaho Capital Sun in a text message that many legislators had been hearing reports of parents losing full custody of their children to co-parents with serious criminal records and some who had been “stuck in the system for several years spending lots of money” to fight for their children “with no end in sight.” 
The two meetings have been marked by detailed explanations of current practices from law enforcement, state child welfare staff, and judges who work in the area. The meetings have also been attended by those who feel strongly that they’ve been wronged by the system — in some cases fighting for custody against a parent with more legal resources, or others who didn’t believe the judge spent the time to consider their evidence and perspective before deciding.

 Child advocates disagree on whether parental consent law hampers child abuse investigations 

The group’s second meeting on July 31 in Hayden, Idaho, prompted discussion over the state’s parental consent law, passed in 2024. Senate Bill 1329 requires parental consent before a “health care service” is provided to minors under 18 in most circumstances. 
Scott Coleman, director of Safe Passage Children’s Advocacy Center in Coeur d’Alene, said the law hampered the center’s ability to provide medical treatment to children whose parents may have abused them. 
“If we have a parent that’s accused of sexual abuse, we cannot perform a forensic interview, basically just an exploratory interview on that child, without a signature from the parent,” Coleman said. “And if the parent is the perpetrator, that’s a problem.” 
  Idaho state Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, talks with attendees during the House State Affairs Committee meeting on Jan. 7, 2025, at the State Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, a task force member and one of the authors of the bill, argued this wasn’t the case. She said there was an exemption that allows for treatment in an emergency.
“The law absolutely allows for that,” Ehardt said. 
Under the bill, treatment may be provided without consent if the provider “reasonably determines that a medical emergency exists” and if the service is necessary “to prevent death or imminent, irreparable physical injury.” 
The bill also requires that minors’ health information be released to parents upon request, with an exemption for cases in which the parent is under investigation for a crime against the child and law enforcement requested the information not be shared with that parent. The medical records also would not need to be shared if doing so would violate a court order. 
An effort to clarify the law to allow for sexual assault exams without parental consent passed the Idaho Senate this year, but failed to advance in the House before the end of the legislative session, Idaho Reports reported. 
Another speaker at the meeting, who has a background in forensic science and working with survivors of abuse, Conrad Woodall, director of operations at the public charter school Kootenai Classical Academy, argued the law was being misinterpreted in regards to sexual assault investigations. 
He said that a forensic exam is not a “treatment” and therefore should not fall under the parental consent requirements in the bill. 
“So there’s no reason for these organizations to not be conducting forensic exams based on this bill,” he said. “What you get is people in risk management that read something, they get all scary, and then they don’t do what they should be doing.” 
Ehardt said there would be another bill brought to clarify the intention of the bill during the 2026 legislative session, which will begin in January.

 Lawmakers question judicial oversight in custody proceedings 

The legislative panel during its day-long meeting also heard from those in the judiciary and questioned them about the oversight regarding conduct and decisions. 
Idaho Judicial Council Executive Director Jeff Brudie, a retired district judge, told lawmakers about the council’s role in investigating and disciplining judges for violations of its Code of Conduct and its role in helping select options for the governor to appoint judges to fill vacancies. 
Magistrate judges oversee child custody and family relations cases, Brudie said, and the council does not play a role in selecting those judges. Local jurisdictions around Idaho each have their own magistrate council, which appoints judges in those districts. 
The councils may recommend suspension or removal of judges if their conduct in and out of the court are deemed unethical. It may also recommend retirement of judges if a disability would substantially interfere with the performance of duties. These recommendations go to the Idaho Supreme Court. 
The council cannot take actions regarding complaints against a particular judge’s ruling — those must be appealed to a higher court. 
Kootenai County Magistrate Judge Mayli Walsh said she oversees a number of types of cases, including family law and domestic relations, guardianships and others. The North Idaho county has the third largest number of family law filings out of all 44 counties, she said. 
She said that she often encourages parents to use a mediator to resolve issues without a trial, and for parents to create their own parenting plans through the court’s Focus on Children Class.
New Idaho law restricts right to public defenders in parental rights termination

“We as judges encourage families to make their own decisions on what parenting (should look like),” Walsh said. “… These individuals are often in relationships that are newly fractured, going through divorce, separation, and so they need additional tools.”
Revoking a parents’ rights to their child requires a “high burden” for courts, Walsh said, usually to demonstrate that the child is unsafe due to mental health issues, incarceration or substance abuse. 
“The right to parent is fundamental,” she said. “It’s enshrined in the Constitution.” 
Ehardt asked Walsh what happens if a judge makes the wrong decision in one of these custody cases. 
The judge responded that the parent may ask the judge to reconsider or appeal to district court. 
Many parents represent themselves in court, Walsh said. A law passed during this year’s legislative session may have inadvertently removed the right to a public defender for parents facing termination of parental rights, the Sun reported.  The change places Idaho among four states that do not guarantee a right to counsel for parents facing termination of parental rights, according to a national child welfare attorney.
 Lawmakers eye reforms to improve outcomes for Idaho children and parents

Scott told the Sun that she’s considering changes to state law that may include utilizing mediation more to reduce judges’ workload and lessen costs for parents, and creating policies to ensure children stay out of custody of abusive parents. 
The task force is scheduled to meet monthly through October. The group has been taking public input, which on Thursday included some tearful testimony from parents who lost some or all of their rights to see their children, or who have been fighting in court for years and spent thousands of dollars. 
During the meeting, Nichols emphasized that the Legislature’s power was limited when it came to the courts. 
“We are not here to second-guess decisions of individual judges or undermine the integrity of the court,” she said.

DUMMERSTON — The nonprofit Landmark Trust USA makes money to preserve historic properties through short-term rentals of such holdings as the late Victorian-era writer Rudyard Kipling’s former Vermont home.
And soon, his horse barn.
Kipling, born in India and raised in England, was 26 when he visited the United States on his 1892 honeymoon and decided to build a house near his wife’s family in the southeastern town of Dummerston.
The man who’d become the first English-language author to win the Nobel Prize in literature named his 2½-story hideaway Naulakha after a Hindi word meaning “jewel beyond price.” There, he penned “The Jungle Book” and “Captains Courageous” and conceived “Kim” and “Just So Stories,” only to depart after constructing a barn for his horses, Nip and Tuck, in 1896.
The property stayed in local hands, then sat unused for 50 years before Landmark Trust USA — an offshoot of Britain’s Landmark Trust conservation charity — purchased it in 1992.

To generate revenue, the organization rents Kipling’s home and carriage house for short-term stays and small gatherings. This week, it’s announcing plans to convert the horse barn’s loft into a studio apartment.
“The Naulakha stable project furthers our preservation mission, ensuring this remarkable place is accessible for future generations,” Susan McMahon, the trust’s executive director, said in a statement.
The plan is part of a $1.25 million Naulakha capital campaign, which is 85% complete and will also replace several roofs and improve groundwater drainage.
Landmark Trust USA manages six historic properties that include the Naulakha buildings, a nearby Dummerston farmhouse and sugarhouse and the Amos Brown House in Whitingham. It also maintains the 570-acre Scott Farm orchard, which grows 130 varieties of heirloom apples just down the road from Kipling’s home.
“We’re making good progress,” Jeremy Ebersole, the trust’s public outreach manager, said of the improvement campaign. “The goal is to have the stable rental done and ready sometime in the fall.”

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma has made drastic improvements in reducing the number of structurally deficient bridges and now ranks fourth in the nation for favorable conditions, the head of the state’s transportation agency said Monday.
The new ranking is a marked improvement from over two decades ago when Oklahoma ranked 49th and the Oklahoma Department of Transportation had nearly 1,200 structurally deficient bridges, said Tim Gatz, the agency’s executive director. 
“That is the highest ranking we have ever achieved,” Gatz told the Oklahoma Transportation Commission, which oversees Gatz’s agency.
The 2025 report by the Federal Highway Administration, found that 35 bridges — or   0.52% — maintained by ODOT were structurally deficient, Gatz said.
The 35 bridges are addressed in the state’s eight-year construction plan, he said.
Every public bridge in the state is inspected at least once every two years, he said. 
“Bringing highway bridges into good condition and preserving them for the future allows the department to put more resources toward other priorities such as improving pavement conditions, adding shoulders to rural, two-lane highways and tackling urban traffic congestion,” said Brenda Perry Clark, an ODOT spokeswoman.
The federal report does not include bridges maintained by counties and cities, he said.
The state agency is responsible for maintaining nearly 6,800 bridges, Gatz said.
A decision by state leaders about 20 years ago to pump tens of millions into the Rebuilding Oklahoma Access and Driver Safety fund, made a significant impact, he said.
“It is going to take continued diligence for us to stay there,” Gatz said.
Oklahoma has about 1,000 bridges that are classified as at risk, or have conditional elements the agency is watching, Gatz said. 
Transportation Commissioner Bobby Alexander called the ranking increase “an incredible feat,” adding that efforts to improve bridges have saved lives.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A pilot program aims to help sustain rural North Dakota grocery stores by developing a joint distribution network and keeping more locally produced food in the state, organizers announced Monday.
The North Dakota Association of Rural Electric Cooperatives is leading the project with a $12.6 million investment from the Bush Foundation. 
North Dakota has 90 small-town grocery stores, down from 137 in 2014, according to the association. These closures have led to a rise in food deserts, or areas where residents have to drive 10 miles or more to the nearest grocery store.
Grants available to help small-town grocers, tourism in North Dakota

Some rural grocery stores pay more for wholesale products than larger chains charge customers, said Ellen Huber, rural development director for the North Dakota Association of Rural Electric Cooperatives.
Even though North Dakota leads the nation in the production of various crops, those crops must be processed at facilities out of state and then returned to the stores at higher prices, Huber said.
The pilot project will involve a food hub in north-central North Dakota to store and distribute local foods and other groceries. Six to eight grocery stores within 100 miles of Minot are interested in collaborating, Huber said, and more partners could be added.
The initiative seeks to band rural grocery stores together to leverage their collective purchasing power to lower wholesale prices for each participating store. 
The hub would help local producers keep more of their products in the state and flowing almost directly to North Dakota rural grocery shelves, Huber said.
“By building the infrastructure to support aggregation, distribution and coordinated purchasing, we can move beyond niche markets and make local food a consistent, reliable option for everyday North Dakotans,” she said.
Investments in rural food sustainability are investments in state’s future

Quinn Renfandt, specialty crop farmer and owner of Betty’s Acres in Minot, said the program will help smaller operators be more competitive.
“Producing food, at any scale, isn’t an easy business, especially on the smaller scale many of us in the Minot area operate at,” Renfandt said in a statement. “This program offers another tool to continue working smarter throughout the entire supply chain.”
Lyndsay Ulrickson, North Dakota grantmaking officer for the Bush Foundation, said the rural grocery distribution grant addresses a critical need in North Dakota. If successful, the project could be expanded regionally.
“We hope that our investment inspires others to consider investing in this important work as well,” she said. 
The program will be developed over several years, with the first two to three years focused on gathering information from rural grocers and food producers. By year three or four of the program, Huber said she hopes the food hub will be complete with testing to follow.
“It is more of a marathon than a sprint,” Huber said. “I know rural grocers can’t wait five years, so we are really optimistic and hopeful that we can dig in, work hard, and get rural grocers in that north-central area collaborating within a year’s time to help reduce those wholesale prices.”

Bicknell’s thrush populations have declined by an average of 5% per year in Northern New England and Eastern New York over the last 15 years, according to data collected through the Vermont Center for Ecostudies.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the Stowe Reporter on July 31.
Despite an increasingly threatened habitat and dwindling population, a rare songbird in its Mt. Mansfield habitat saw the return of many adults during its annual banding this year — a positive sign of the population’s endurance.
The Vermont Center for Ecostudies has been studying the Bicknell’s thrush — a small branch-brown songbird, named for the amateur ornithologist who first identified them in the Catskills — for over three decades.
Earlier this month, the center, under lead bander Anna Peel, once again set up nets to capture and tag the thrush with tracking devices during its mating season. The center monitors the bird population to learn more about its migration patterns and how well it survives year to year, as well as to count the number adult and young birds on the mountain.
The Bicknell’s thrush is picky about their habitat. They spend their mating season in the northeastern United States and Canada, with a preference for “sky islands” like the alpine summit of Mansfield — though most of the population winters almost exclusively on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
The thrush, along with their subtle coloring, trilling song — which they prefer to sing at sunset instead of sunrise — display unique mating habits, just one of the mysteries that still abound with this songbird, according to Desiree Narango, a conservation scientist with the Center for Ecostudies who specializes in the songbird species. 
Based on data that skews heavily male, as the females are harder to catch, Narango said the birds exhibit polygynandry, meaning females partner with multiple males and males partner with multiple females in the nesting process.

“They have a really interesting population dynamic, and that sex ratio changes from year to year, so in some years we have a tremendous number of males and a very low number of females, and in some years it’s more even,” Narango said.
The difficulty in catching females makes learning more about the birds’ private lives challenging, and in particular has prevented researchers from gleaning much about the females, a gap in knowledge that is essential to the challenged species’ survival.
The warming world caused by the ongoing climate crisis threatens all alpine bird species, but the already scarce Bicknell’s thrush population is particularly vulnerable. Data collected through the center’s crowdsourced collection program Mountain Birdwatch indicates that Bicknell’s thrush populations have declined by an average of 5% per year in Northern New England and Eastern New York over the last 15 years.

The Mt. Mansfield banding project began over 30 years ago with a specific focus on the Bicknell’s thrush and has expanded over time to track six different Alpine bird species. Two of those species — the white-throated sparrow and dark-eyed junco — are among the fastest declining bird species in North America, according to Narango. Exactly why remains an open question, but researchers broadly point to human-caused environmental pressures, including climate change.
“Part of our work right now is trying to understand what those drivers are of (Bicknell’s thrush) females, because that’s ultimately changing the population,” Narango said. “Another part that we’re currently trying to better understand is what their diets are and what kind of insects that they might be more closely reliant on to feed their young and to sustain the population.”
Still, at this year’s banding, Narango and her colleagues observed at least one positive population signal.
“We actually had a lot of returning birds this year, so birds that we’ve captured in previous years have come back, meaning that they’ve survived over the season, which is good news for the population, but also provide some information to us that the events that happened during other times in the cycle, such as migration or during the winter, were favorable for first survival in this species,” Narango said.

(Screenshot via C-SPAN)Gov. Kim Reynolds on Monday joined a news conference in Washington, D.C., to praise the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Trump administration for allowing Iowa to restrict certain foods under a federal aid program and implement an alternative summer nutrition program for children.
Reynolds spoke at a news conference focused on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that was hosted by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The Trump administration officials discussed approving new waivers for restrictions on what food can be purchased through the public assistance program.
Rollins signed six SNAP state waivers — for Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia — at the event, approving restrictions on food purchases under the program. These waivers will allow states to limit the purchase of certain items, like candy or soda, using food benefits. She said these waivers are part of the administration’s larger “Make America Healthy Again” work, championed primarily by Kennedy.

“The SNAP waivers are just one piece of the MAHA effort,” Rollins said. “We work so closely together to encourage voluntary commitments to remove artificial food dyes, among other things, from our food supply. And together, we are crafting sensical dietary guidelines for Americans that prioritize whole, healthy and nutritious foods.”
Though the press conference highlighted approval of new waivers, the USDA had signed off in May on Iowa’s  SNAP waiver. The new restrictions take effect beginning Jan. 1, 2026, and will last for two years.
Reynolds thanked Rollins for “enabling Iowa to help lead the nation in SNAP reform.” In Iowa, she said, allowing people to purchase items like sweetened drinks, desserts and salty snacks through SNAP “truly isn’t helping low-income families,” but is worsening problems with obesity.
“Thirty-seven percent of our adults and 17 percent of our youth, ages 6 through 17, are suffering from obesity,” Reynolds said. “And that’s something that as the governor of this great state I can’t accept. And it’s why that we’ve really begun to strategically reform our efforts to help address food insecurity and nutrition.”
Another way Iowa is working to address obesity, she said, is through the Healthy Kids Iowa demonstration project, also approved by the USDA in May.
Iowa had declined to participate in 2024 and 2025 in the SUN Bucks program, the federal summer nutrition program also known as Summer EBT, that provides an extra $120 per child to eligible low-income families each month when school is not in session. Critics and hunger advocates said the governor had chosen to leave money on the table that could have gone to families in need, but the governor said she opposed the program over concerns about unhealthy food purchases.
Instead, Reynolds sought federal approval to pursue an alternate program, providing a premade box of food worth $40 each month from 500 access points. The waiver for Healthy Kids Iowa was denied in 2024 under the Biden administration, but approved under Trump.
Though there were 500 sites approved in the initial waiver, there are currently 264 locations providing the food boxes to program participants. Hunger advocates have said this program is more difficult for families in need to access food, as transportation to these locations can be more difficult than going to a retailer that accepts SNAP through the Summer EBT program.
But Reynolds said the state has leveraged Iowa’s existing network of food pantries to distribute these boxes in all 99 counties — and that the program provides food at a lower cost than through Summer EBT.
“Some of the food banks that weighed in, and our partners in this effort, said that they can actually buy up to six times more food than a person using that SUN Bucks program at retail prices,” Reynolds said.
Luke Elzinga, board chair for the Iowa Hunger Coalition, said some of the promises made about the Health Kids Iowa program, like allowing families to choose food items that meet their preferences and “cultural and dietary needs,” have not happened as the program was rolled out this summer. He also said fewer children received food through the program than projected.
“When you compare it just what we could have seen with summer EBT, you know, that’s only about 15% of the kids who could have been assisted through summer EBT that are being served through this Healthy Kids Iowa program,” Elzinga said. “So I don’t think it’s an example for other states.”
The news conference was part of a larger “MAHA Monday” event on the National Mall, which included a “Great American Farmers Market.”
Kennedy said restrictions on SNAP, and other “MAHA” efforts under Rollins’ leadership, were vital to making Americans healthier and solving the country’s “chronic disease crisis.” He claimed 10% of SNAP purchases were made on soda, and that an additional 3% to 7% went to candy — purchases he said should not be made using public funds.
“We all believe in free choice,” Kennedy said. “We live in a democracy. People can make their own choice about what they’re going to buy and what they’re not going to buy. If you want to buy a sugary soda, you ought to be able to do that. U.S. taxpayers should not pay for it.”

Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) sat down with leaders in the emergency department at Trinity Health Ann Arbor, to discuss the issues troubling the hospital amid an uncertain environment for health care providers. 
During the meeting Dingell asked several questions on home and community-based health care, the impact Medicaid cuts would have on the facility, and the factors contributing to crowding and a shortage of beds for patients seeking inpatient and emergency care. 
While discussing the lack of beds for patients, David Vandenberg, the chief medical officer for Trinity Health Ann Arbor and Trinity Health Livingston, explained they are seeing more older patients with medical illness versus conditions that can be treated with surgery.

Hospitals would previously run at 75-80% capacity on a busy day, and had no trouble absorbing additional patients, however that’s no longer the case Vandenberg explained. 
While the hospital previously saw 240 of its 500 beds full on average, the average number of occupied beds has increased to 400, Vandenberg said.
“It’s the patients who have pneumonia, who come in with complications from diabetes, or, you know, other infections. You know, heart disease, lung disease. And they’re just, they’re staying longer because they have more comorbidities, it takes them a little bit longer to get better, and then they’re often debilitated by the end of their hospitalization and they need skilled care. And then we get stuck,” Vandenberg said. 
It’s not a case of not being able to find somewhere for these patients to go following hospitalization, Vandenberg explained, but rather a need for insurance to approve a location, sometimes leaving patients languishing for two to three days.

The longer patients wait for skilled nursing, the more debilitated a patient is likely to become, meaning their stays are extended, feeding into a vicious cycle and contributing to a logjam in available beds, Vandenberg explained. 
While the hospital has tried to alleviate its congestion by offering some inpatient care in a home setting, it’s been difficult to get payers to cover the cost, Vandenberg said. 
Tarun Abraham, director of acute care flow and care management for several Trinity Health facilities explained their work with Huron Valley Ambulance through their community paramedic programs. While they do not offer home care, the paramedics are able to check in with patients and offer services like administering antibiotics. In order for the program to be more robust, it will need more payment sources to sustain it, Abraham explained.

However, offering care in a home setting also comes with shortfalls, Abraham explained, with family members who were handling care prior to a loved one’s hospitalization now shouldering some of the burden carried by hospital staff.
With congressional Republican’s “Big Beautiful Bill” slated to cut Medicaid spending by $911 billion over the next decade, which the Congressional Budget Office expects this will add 10 million uninsured individuals over the same time frame, Daniel McGillicuddy, an emergency medicine physician, predicted patients would delay seeking care due to costs. 
However, under federal law, hospitals must offer care to anyone regardless of insurance or their ability to pay, with hospitals covering the cost of uncompensated care. If individuals delay seeking care, that will likely increase the number of patients that need to be admitted that may not have needed emergency care, leading to more patients in an already overcrowded system. McGillicuddy explained. 
While this change won’t be immediate, McGillicuddy noted that 10 years ago, patients typically were not held in the emergency departments awaiting inpatient care, whereas now it’s a daily occurrence.
Additionally, once a hospital hits 85-90% capacity, things begin to take longer, meaning that patients will have longer stays, McGillicuddy explained.

The emergency department at Trinity Health Ann Arbor has 62 beds, Vandenberg explained, with 20 of those spots located in hallways. The hospital is in the process of rebuilding its emergency department, not so they can hold more patients, but so patients can receive proper care. 
Katy Hoffman, the chief nursing officer for Trinity Health Ann Arbor and Livingston, explained that they care for more than 100 patients in their emergency departments on most days, but that those patients are cared for in hallways and in upright chairs. 
“No matter what the challenges are and no matter what the status of the patient is and what their payer is like, you know, we’re going to continue to provide really great care. The challenge is, how much of it is going to be uncompensated, that as an organization, we’re going to struggle with,” Hoffman said.
As the health system works to navigate these difficulties, Dingell repeatedly offered her help in resolving issues on the policy side. 
“You’ve got to come back at me on things that you think we should be thinking about. I’m good at casework, and my team will tell you, I do the casework myself,” Dingell said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 17:56:25.548151

Federal officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management held one of their first public meetings on the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport Wednesday– a project nearly three-decades in the making.
The airport would be one of the largest in the nation by land area, sprawling across 23,000 acres of public land in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm.
Nearly a hundred people attended the meeting to provide public comments on the proposed airport – input that will help guide the federal government as they work through the environmental review process.
That review will likely center on the airport’s potential impact on two endangered species who call the area home: the desert tortoise and the white-margined penstemon, a small pink bell-shaped flower.

Early maps of the project show that desert tortoises will likely need to be relocated to accommodate the construction of the airport. However, recent studies have suggested that relocating desert tortoises can be detrimental to their survival.
One long-term study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that in the first three years of relocating 158 desert tortoises less than 10 miles from their habitat about 50% died, mostly due to predators.
The airport would also encroach on one of the sole known populations of the white-margined penstemon. A 2021 study commissioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found a 50% chance of extinction for the wildflower in the next 50 years due to climate change and habitat destruction.
The Center for Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter held a press conference outside the meeting to speak on the airport’s potential impact on desert habitat and wildlife.
“If we destroy our desert for sprawl, we will end up harming our ecosystems, harming our air quality, diminishing our water supplies, and affecting people here in Las Vegas very substantially,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity.
Critics of the multi-billion dollar project said the airport was a sign of reckless sprawl in Southern Nevada, a region experiencing severe long-term drought.
State officials have suggested the new airport could lead to further development. In 2023, state lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Bill 19 which would allow Clark County to put aside at least 5,000 acres for a new commercial and residential development in the vicinity of the new airport.
“We cannot afford to sprawl all the way down to Jean. We cannot afford the wildlife impacts or the water impacts or the air quality impacts from adding a second gigantic commercial airport,” said Vinny Spotleson, the president of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter.
Several locals who spoke at the meeting questioned the need for a second airport, noting the development of high-speed rail between Nevada and California, and the presence of several other airports in southern Nevada that could be expanded to meet demand.
James Chrisley, the senior director for the Clark County Department of Aviation, said the Harry Reid International Airport will not be able to keep up with projected demand for air travel without the Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport.
According to estimates by the agency, the Harry Reid International Airport will reach its full capacity of 63 million to 65 million passengers annually by 2030. The airport would accommodate both passenger and cargo flights.
Decades-old decisions have also left the county with limited options when it comes to the location of an additional airport.
“We’re landlocked,” Chrisley said.
The Harry Reid Airport was initially built in 1942 outside the city of Las Vegas, in a relatively undeveloped area. However, the rapid growth of the Las Vegas metropolitan area over subsequent decades led to the city’s suburbs surrounding the airport, effectively landlocking it.
The Clark County Department of Aviation has evaluated several locations and looked into potentially modifying smaller airports to meet their needs, but concluded Ivanpah Valley was the only feasible option.
More than a dozen sites were evaluated by 2005 as potential locations for the airport before being whittled down to four: Apex, Eldorado Valley, Moapa Reservation, and Ivanpah Valley.
Nellis Air Force Base, Moapa Reservation, and Apex were eventually eliminated due to airspace constraints. Between Eldorado Valley and Ivanpah Valley, the latter won out.
“We’ve revalidated that study recently and continue to look at it just to make sure this is truly the only feasible site,” Chrisley said.
Plans for the airport were first initiated in 2000 when the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Act, championed by U.S. Senator Harry Reid and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, transferred about 6,000 acres of public land to Clark County for a new airport.
The Clark County Department of Aviation submitted their first draft by 2006, but local economic conditions following the Great Recession and other local budgetary constraints stalled the project for decades. In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the federal government to suspend any work on the environmental review.
Chrisley said things changed this year after the Harry Reid International Airport recorded 58.4 million passengers last year, a 1.39% increase over 2023’s previous high.
“We’ve been planning this for 25 years, and I personally have been on this for the last almost 10 years. It’s time. The Valley continues to grow and we need to support the innovation of this community,” Chrisley said.
Preliminary plans show the airport would include a central terminal, two runways, a taxiway system, and an air traffic control tower. The plan would also require an expansion of the Interstate-15 and a new dedicated interchange.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation.)Thousands of Washington motorists have been caught speeding through highway work zones by new cameras the state deployed this year. 
Since the cameras turned on in April, the Washington State Patrol says they’ve been used to issue 7,599 infractions, with nearly 4,000 more being processed, as of last week. 
But only 262 of those thousands have resulted in fines, according to state patrol. First-time violators don’t have to pay anything, but the next infraction carries a $248 penalty. 
Starting next July, drivers won’t get a grace period. The first violation will bring a $125 penalty, followed by $248 for subsequent offenses. 
Washington averages over 1,300 work zone crashes annually, according to the state Department of Transportation. Last year, seven people were killed in crashes in work zones across the state, while another 38 incidents caused serious injuries. Speeding was a factor in about a fifth of those crashes.
A 2024 study from the Associated General Contractors of America found that 64% of highway contractors reported cars crashing into construction sites within the past year. 
“The first few months of the program confirm what statistics show and what our workers have been saying — too many people speed through work zones,” said Secretary of Transportation Julie Meredith in a statement.
In 2023, lawmakers unanimously authorized installing the cameras in work zones, at the request of the state transportation department. At the time, the state estimated over 250,000 infractions per year once the new cameras were fully implemented.
The state’s latest transportation budget, passed in April, counts on $138 million in fines over the next six years from infractions captured by the cameras. The money goes toward keeping the program afloat, along with supporting DUI patrols and other safety programs. 
Officials hope the cameras will get drivers to slow down, and keep workers safe.

“While the number of infractions has been high during the first 90 days of operation, we hope to see a reduction of speeding through work zones as the word gets out about this new safety tool,” state patrol Chief John Batiste said. “This isn’t about writing tickets and fining motorists; this is about slowing inattentive drivers down and saving lives.”
The new camera program is set to last until 2030, unless the Legislature extends it. 
The cameras mounted on orange trailers have been rotating through work zones across the state. So far, the state has deployed three of the cameras. They’ve surveilled construction on Interstate 5 near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, state routes 16, 18, and 522, Interstate 90 and U.S. 12, according to state patrol.
The state plans on rolling out as many as 15 cameras in total by 2027.
Signs alert drivers to their presence. Cameras are only active when workers are present. 
Recorded infractions go for review to state troopers, who then send them to the vehicle’s registered owner. The photos don’t capture the drivers. 
Car owners must respond to the infraction notice online or by mail. They can contest it with the state Office of Administrative Hearings, request a fine reduction or set up a payment plan. 
The infractions are considered non-moving violations, so they don’t impact driving records or insurance costs.
This legislative session, lawmakers in Olympia considered requiring an online course on work zone and first responder safety as a prerequisite for getting a driver’s license. The bill passed the state House nearly unanimously before stalling in the Senate.

Gov. Mark Gordon is among a reported 20 Republican governors who agreed to the president’s request to use guard members for immigration enforcement duties — maybe paperwork.
The post Gordon to deploy Wyoming National Guard to support ICE in Trump’s mass deportation effort appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming National Guard members may soon assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the detention and deportation of undocumented people, a spokesperson for Gov. Mark Gordon confirmed Monday to WyoFile.
Gordon is among 20 Republican governors who have agreed to enlist guard troops in President Donald Trump’s rapidly escalating detention operation. Key details about the deployment remain undecided — including the number of participating troops, the nature of their duties and, critically, the question of whether they would be working in Wyoming or deploying to another state. 
“We are still determining exactly what that participation involves and are waiting for some more information from our federal partners,” Gordon’s spokesperson Michael Pearlman told WyoFile in an emailed statement Monday.
Last week, The New York Times reported on a memo from ICE officials that described using guard troops to process detention paperwork and do other administrative tasks. Department of Homeland Security officials hope that in doing so, the troops can free up ICE agents to find and detain undocumented immigrants. In June, however, National Public Radio reported that DHS was also considering National Guard troops as detention guards, transporting detained immigrants and pursuing “fugitives.” 
The New York Times reported troops “would be deployed in 20 states with Republican governors,” but it did not list the states involved. The deployment could start this month, the Times reported. 
Wyoming does not have a federal immigration detention facility, though ICE holds undocumented immigrants in some county jails. 
Guard officials and the governor are still coordinating details of the deployment with federal officials in the region, including where members will serve, Wyoming National Guard Director of Strategic Communications Joseph Coslett told WyoFile. They’re “basically trying to work out what all the (federal officials) need and where,” Coslett said, adding that ultimately the decision about the numbers of personnel deployed, and what they do, will fall to Gordon. 
“This one is a little different obviously,” Coslett said, “so we have to work with our national partners and there’s still a lot of questions.” 
The second-term governor’s decision to deploy the Wyoming National Guard further enmeshes the Equality State in Trump’s sprawling and aggressive effort to detain and deport people. News of the deployment comes closely on the heels of Gordon’s announcement that some Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers also will help enforce federal immigration laws.

Unlawful entry into the country, on its own, is a civil offense, not a criminal one. In Wyoming and Colorado, ICE has increasingly been detaining people who do not have criminal convictions, according to reporting by WyoFile and The Colorado Sun. 
Trump continues to involve the military in the domestic immigration enforcement effort, including by sending National Guard troops and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles when residents of that city protested ICE activity. Department of Homeland Security Officials in May requested that the Department of Defense consider the deployment of 20,000 National Guard members for immigration enforcement, according to The New York Times. DHS has also enlisted other federal law enforcement agencies in its detention effort, such as the U.S. Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Times reported.

In July, the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress passed legislation to funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to ICE — tripling the agency’s budget and bringing it up to $28 billion. That money is going to hiring more personnel and increasing available detention space, both by building new facilities and contracting with county jails, among other uses. 
Still, Trump may seek to draw the military even further into immigration enforcement and into deployments to other American cities. Homeland security officials have asked the Department of Defense to find ways to better support their efforts, including “during the next instance of L.A.-type operations,” according to a separate leaked memo, which was reported on by The New Republic. 
For this new deployment involving the Wyoming National Guard, Trump is using a different legal justification than the one he used to order the California National Guard into Los Angeles. In that case, Trump federalized the guard troops. For this new deployment, state governors must approve the use of their National Guard members for the federal mission, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The federal government will pay for the deployment, however.
Pearlman last week said the state was not pursuing federal funding that recently became available for state governments to build migrant detention centers. He reiterated Monday that the state was not pursuing an immigration detention center, though that wouldn’t preclude the federal government from seeking to build one or contracting a for-profit prison company for the job.  
Five Wyoming sheriffs have agreements with ICE to hold people arrested on local crimes if the agency wants to detain them because of their immigration status. ICE is also using jails in Natrona and Sweetwater counties to hold increasing numbers of immigrants from a privately run detention center in Aurora, Colorado. ICE officials have said they’re using the jails when the Aurora facility has capacity issues.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) A new national study has determined that nursing homes will often ramp up staffing levels in anticipation of state inspections and then cut staffing once the inspectors have left the building.
The study, by the National Bureau of Economic Research, examines the overall impact of government inspections on the quality of care in U.S. nursing homes. Using payroll records and admissions data, the researchers found nursing homes “respond strategically” to government inspections by increasing the quantity and the quality of their staffing, and by reducing admissions and temporarily discharging patients, in a short-term effort to improve patient care and boost their inspection ratings.
The study is presented in the form of a published “working paper,” intended to elicit discussion and comment, and has not been peer-reviewed or subject to review by the national bureau’s board of directors.

“Nursing homes significantly increase the work hours of nurses and nurse assistants, the main nursing home staff, in response to health inspections,” the report states. “On the day of peak response, the work hours of nurses and nurse assistants rise by 10.2 and 6.6 hours on average, respectively.” Similar increases in work hours were noted for physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, activities professionals, administrators, physical therapy assistants, dietitians and other care providers.
The researchers also noted “a significant increase in temporary discharges — i.e., the number of patients who are discharged but return to a nursing home within two weeks — in response to health inspections. On the peak day, temporary discharges increase by 4%.”
Those two factors, combined with a decrease in new admissions during inspections, result in improved staff-to-patient ratios — which may improve patient care. However, all of the changes that improve the staff-to-patient ratios “drop immediately once the inspection is completed,” according to the report. “The work hours of all types of staff decline to the typical levels — i.e., those on days relatively distant from the inspection — or fall even slightly below the typical levels, on the day right after the inspection.”
The authors note that nursing home inspections generally last a few days, during which a team of inspectors employed by the state, often nurses, will travel to the facility to conduct an onsite evaluation of care quality. Although the inspections are conducted on an annual basis, the federal government does not require them to be conducted exactly every 365 days — as long as an inspection is within 15 months of the previous one and the state’s average interval between inspections at all nursing homes does not exceed 12 months.
In theory, the broad range of time in which an annual inspection can be conducted makes the visits less predictable and the inspection findings less likely to be skewed by artificial increases in staffing. Even so, a facility that’s waited 14 months since its last inspection can fully expect inspectors to arrive on the scene within four weeks, which would allow for a ramp-up in staffing.

“This research should prompt elected leaders in Congress and in state legislatures to ask some basic questions of those conducting nursing home inspections,” said John Hale, co-owner of The Hale Group, an Ankeny-based consulting firm focused on older and disabled Iowans. “Questions like, ‘What’s the goal of doing nursing home inspections? Is it to improve the quality of care? If that is the goal, is it being accomplished? Has care been improved and how do we know? If it’s not being improved, why not?’”
According to the National Institutes of Health, some states appear to routinely schedule visits during the same week each year, making their inspections predictable.
Last December, for example, the North Carolina Office of State Auditor reviewed that state’s scheduling of nursing home inspections and found the state wasn’t adhering to federal guidelines on how to make inspections less predictable.
About 43% of annual inspections occurred in the same month as the previous inspection, and 73% began on a Monday. In addition, a fifth of nursing homes were being inspected in a geographically predictable manner, with inspectors moving from one facility to the next in the same order as in previous years.
Dean Lerner, who headed Iowa’s Department of Inspections and Appeals under former Gov. Chet Culver, said he initiated efforts to make the inspections less predictable so the department would have a more accurate picture of the facility.
“I did off-schedule inspections — having folks do the annual inspections after six months, or after seven months,” he said. “In addition, we’d have the inspectors show up in the middle of the night, which would be unexpected, of course.”
A review of the inspections that occur now in Iowa shows that the comprehensive annual inspections — technically, they’re called “recertification surveys” — typically take place in a different month than the previous year’s inspection, and repeat violators may find themselves facing two such inspections in less than 10 months.
At Cedar Rapids’ Heritage Specialty Care, for example, inspectors conducted an annual inspection on Aug. 22, 2024. Amid a series of additional, focused inspections that were triggered by complaints, the state inspectors were back for another comprehensive annual inspection just nine months later, on May 22, 2025.

Starting Aug. 1, New York will offer free phone calls in state prisons, becoming the sixth state to do so — and the first to enact the policy without legislation. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York will offer free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons starting Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so.
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026.
In Florida, responding to reports that prisoner contact with loved ones helps reduce the recidivism rate, state lawmakers in 2023 approved a $1 million pilot project to allow inmates with good behavior to make one free 15-minute phone call per month to the outside world. However, Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed the money without comment.
New York is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation. Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.
The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
Recidivism
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

Lightning ignited the Middle Mesa Fire on Aug. 1 in a swath of the Carson National Forest about 20 northeast of Navajo Dam. It’s difficult to contain due to “extremely low fuel moistures” and low humidity, according to a news release. 
The latest infrared map captured overnight puts the fire at roughly 2,115 acres. That’s a growth of more than 1,000 acres since Sunday. More than 140 personnel are tackling the blaze via airplane and on the ground in hopes of slowing its spread. 
It’s burning in a remote area roughly a mile from the Colorado border, but natural gas wells and pipelines sit nearby, according to the Forest Service. According to an operations map, about a dozen oil and gas wells are within the existing fire perimeter, with dozens more in the area. 
“Fire managers request that the public avoid the northern reaches of the [Jicarilla] ranger district for safety of themselves and fire crews,” according to the news release.

(Photo by Getty Images)The Maine State Chamber of Commerce has been following the Trump administration’s actions on tariffs since the start of the year, said President and Chief Executive Officer Patrick Woodcock. 
Initially, the chamber’s biggest concern was the potential for few exemptions and retaliatory steps that would drive up costs of everyday products for Mainers. 
But while the overall effect so far has been more limited than anticipated, Woodcock said Monday that some individual companies and industries are already seeing a “dramatic impact.” For example, he said lumber product prices have increased. Similarly, tariffs have driven up the cost of cars, which Woodcock said has been “hugely consequential” for consumers.
In Maine, “our forest products industry is the one that is most affected with these specific industry, sector-level tariffs,” Woodcock said. The state imports 2.3 million tons of wood products annually, most of which comes from Canada, according to a recent industry report from the Maine Forest Service.
The Maine Forest Products Council did not respond to a request for comment from Maine Morning Star by the time of publication. 
Trump levies a host of new tariffs on U.S. trading partners

Prices for softwood lumber, which can be used in construction or furniture making, were up more than 2% over the past month and nearly 17% higher than they were a year ago, according to a July 25 report from the National Association of Home Builders. 
The report attributes recent lumber price volatility to rising tariffs, as well as increased demand, supply chain issues and insufficient domestic production. One way to address the high prices would be a long-term deal with Canada to reduce tariffs and boost imported lumber, the report goes on to say.
However, on Thursday — one day before the deadline President Donald Trump set for reaching trade agreements with dozens of countries — Trump issued an executive order raising the tariff rate on goods imported from Canada to 35%. 
Trump said earlier that day it would be hard to reach an agreement with the country because of Canada’s announcement that it will recognize a Palestinian state.
The executive order outlining the tariff increase also said Canada, which Trump previously suggested should become the 51st state, failed to do more to address the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. through the northern border. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey and other Democratic state attorneys general are currently challenging that argument in the U.S. Court of International Trade, which last week ruled in their favor.
Since the start of Trump’s second term, many Maine industries have expressed concerns about a potential trade war with Canada, given how deeply interconnected the state’s economy is with its northern neighbor. Every year, Maine exports $1.4 billion in goods to Canada and in turn imports more than $5 billion worth of goods. 
In April, Maine farmers and brewers shared their worries about increased costs from the tax on imported goods being passed onto consumers.
Woodcock said Trump’s executive orders have narrowed the scope of the tariffs by excluding products that are certified by the existing free trade agreement for North American countries, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA. 
The executive order issued last Thursday reiterates that some goods from Canada are still protected by that agreement, which is up for renegotiation next year.
“That limits the number of products that are affected,” Woodcock explained, so the consequences of the tariffs will “be more company-by-company and will not encompass some of the consumer products commodities that we were very concerned about, including heating oil and electricity.”

Scholten’s policies, discussed Monday at Griffieon Family Farm outside of Ankeny, are aimed at improving competition in the agriculture sector, funding conservation efforts and supporting regional food systems.  
The agriculture sector is in a recession even “before tariffs — this is just the way the industry is working right now,” Scholten said. 
According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, real gross domestic product declined in Iowa by 6.1% in the first quarter of 2025, and agriculture was the leading contributor to the decline.

Scholten said consolidation in the marketplace has hurt not just family farms, but the whole sector. As an example, he held up a sign with a breakdown of the top four meat-packing companies in the country, Tyson, JBS, National Beef and Cargill, and all of the meat companies they own. 
“When you go to the grocery store, you think you have all these options,” Scholten said. “But … it’s owned by just a couple.” 
He said a lack of solid competition “squeezes” farmers and consumers. While the meat industry is a good example of consolidation, Scholten said everything from seed, to railroads, to fertilizer and even tractors are consolidated beyond the levels considered a monopoly.

Scholten said the federal Farm Bill should address these issues along with increased oversight from the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice. His farm policy objectives also include stopping future ag mergers, reforming the Packers and Stockyards Act, requiring country of origin labeling and stopping foreign ownership of agricultural land. 
The Farm Bill is traditionally a piece of bipartisan legislation, typically reauthorized every five years to lay out agriculture, federal nutrition programs and rural development budgets. The bill was reauthorized last in 2018 and has been extended the past two years.
Tony Thompson, who grows produce near Elkhart, said these are issues that affect Iowans in “many ways” including the prices at the grocery store, the wages a company will pay as a living wage and the quality of the water in the tap. 
“We talk about the value of feeding the world, and we don’t really feed ourselves, “ Thompson said. “We talk about the value of farm families and rural communities, but we’re doing everything from a policy standpoint that essentially undermines that.” 
According to a case study from Iowa State University, more than 90% of table food consumed in Iowa is brought it in from other places.
Scholten said it is also important to carve out funding in the farm bill and other farm policies for conservation efforts that protect water quality and the environment. He noted the importance of providing adequate funding to programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Reserve Program that incentivize farmers to implement practices like cover crops or rotational grazing. 
Scholten, Thompson and LaVon Griffieon, who helped to host the event, mentioned programs like the Local Food for Schools funding which was cut early in the new administration, as an example of programs that helped support regional food systems. This program helped schools purchase goods from local farmers and gave regional food producers a stable market to sell into. 
More nutritious, local food has also been a priority in the Republican Party. Lawmakers introduced bills in Iowa to change school and federal nutrition assistance programs to make them healthier. At a national level, the Make America Healthy Again initiative is pushing for a removal of food dyes, ultraprocessed foods and additives from America’s diet. 
Scholten said there is “overlap” between this GOP initiative and what he believes needs to happen in the agriculture sector. 
“There’s opportunity to work across the aisle on this, and I hope that becomes more of a theme,” Scholten said. 
Scholten said while President Donald Trump likes to say that “farmers love him” there are farmers who have had their contracts from U.S. Department of Agriculture cut, soybean farmers who lost a share of the market during the trade war of Trump’s first term, farmers paying for tariffs on inputs and others being beaten out of the consolidated market. 
“We’re selling out rural America,” Scholten said. “What we’re laying out here is an opportunity to fight back.” 
Scholten is one of several Democrats seeking the nomination, including Nathan Sage and Zach Wahls. Sen. Joni Ernst has not announced whether she is seeking a second term but one other Republican, Jim Carlin, is in the race.

(Credit: Hurricane Valley Fire and Rescue) A number of new fires started over the weekend in already smokey Utah, bringing the summer’s total to 717 blazes, the majority of them human-caused. 
On Friday, the Little Cottonwood Fire was reported along John’s Valley Road in Garfield County, burning about 20 acres on state-owned land before it was suppressed. Officials say it was human-caused, possibly from roadside sparks, dragging chains or other vehicle maintenance issues. 
On Saturday, a glider crashed into Mahogany Mountain in Mountain Green, located in Morgan County, killing the pilot and sparking a fire at 7,000 feet, according to the Mountain Green Fire Protection District. After working until about 1:30 a.m., crews were able to hold the fire to about 3 acres.   
‘No moisture in sight’: Conditions fueling 48,000-acre Monroe Canyon Fire expected to worsen

That same day, a 32-year-old man was arrested for abandoning a fire, a class A misdemeanor, and driving under the influence, a class B misdemeanor, after police say he abandoned an ATV that had caught fire at Sand Hollow State Park, according to an affidavit filed by the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. The incident resulted in a 3.5-acre fire. 
On Sunday, a grass fire in Tremonton nearly took out several structures before the Garland and Tremonton fire departments were able to contain it. The 2-acre fire was sparked by someone welding in dry grass. 
On Monday, officials worked to evacuate American Fork Canyon in Utah County following a fire that had grown to about a quarter-acre. Tibble Fork Reservoir, the nearby campgrounds and summer home areas had all been evacuated Monday. The fire was reported at about 7 a.m., and the cause is under investigation. 
All that comes as the state is dealing with several large fires and a red flag warning that conditions could worsen as the week goes on. The red flag warning — issued during periods of hot, dry and windy weather — remains in effect until Wednesday for most of Utah, excluding the eastern part of the state along the Colorado border, and parts of Tooele and Box Elder counties.
Cox declares state of emergency as intense wildfires burn in Utah

Utah has seen at least 717 fires this year, 495 of them caused by humans. At least 135 fires were determined to be natural, and the remaining 87 are unknown or still under investigation. A total of 140,416 acres have burned. 
Utah’s largest fire this year is the Monroe Canyon Fire, burning at 62,700 acres in between Interstate 70 and state Route 24 in the Richfield area. More than 1,500 firefighters are working around the clock to control the fire, which as of Monday is only 13% contained. At least seven structures have been destroyed. 
“This is a big one. It’s been a long time since we’ve had a big one like this. The odds of us putting it out anytime soon are pretty low, just to be honest. We know that the forecast is not great right now,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Friday. 
Over the weekend, crews made progress fighting the Little Pole Fire in Box Elder County, which is now 90% and 461 acres. The Deer Creek Fire, which is estimated at 17,724 acres along the Utah-Colorado border in the La Sal Mountains near Moab, is also now 95% contained.

Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.
After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
A Valley Children’s spokesperson told Stateline that game-day entitlements at the stadium, such as the tailgates, catering and suite, have been used for patients and their families.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

Before the November 2024 election, the Alabama secretary of state initiated a purge of thousands of registered voters but was blocked by a federal judge (Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images).Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.
Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
 Undermining ERIC

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
 ‘A total shock’

In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Ned Lamont with the legislators and housing advocates who are still angry at the governor’s veto of an omnibus housing bill.
They all share a disdain of Trump’s order pushing cities to combat homelessness not by creating housing but with involuntary commitments for drug and mental health treatment.
“President Trump, homelessness is not a crime, not here in Connecticut and not in America,” Lamont said, addressing advocates at the state Capitol. “These folks need help, not handcuffs. These folks need housing, not handcuffs.”
Lamont, a Democrat who has hinted he will seek a third term next year, was rewarded with applause, whoops and a few hard looks from lawmakers who believed the governor fumbled an opportunity to put those words into action.
“We had a bill that did that,” said Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, the co-chair of the Housing Committee. Felipe said he was optimistic of eventually finding a version acceptable to Lamont.
With his veto in June of House Bill 5002, Lamont sided with suburban opponents and Republican legislators who had urged a veto of the measure as an intrusion into local zoning.
HB 5002 was drawn to address a critical housing shortage by requiring municipalities to set “fair share” goals for affordable housing, prioritizing state aid to communities that build housing, and streamlining approval for so-called “middle housing,” defined as a building with two to nine units.
Lamont said Monday that talks are continuing on a revised version that he hopes could be adopted in a special session anticipated for the fall.
“I want a bill that we can all get behind,” Lamont  said. “We’re working on that every day, and we’re going to get a really good housing bill that has the support of all the people in this room.”
Lamont was among a dozen speakers at a press conference his staff organized Monday in opposition to an executive order signed July 24 by Trump that was cast more as tough law-and-order measure than a solution to root causes of homelessness. Its title: “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets”
“Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe,” Trump wrote. “The number of individuals living on the streets in the United States on a single night during the last year of the previous administration — 274,224 — was the highest ever recorded.”
The order cites no specific authority for a president to order local police or state agencies to break up homeless encampments or take homeless off the streets. 
It states vaguely that the administration will seek “the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States’ policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appropriate periods of time.”
While the Trump administration has slashed spending for drug treatment and is considering more cuts, the executive order promises “technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and ‘step-down’ treatment standards.”
State officials and advocates in Connecticut see the order as a dramatic shift from “housing-first” approaches to homelessness popularized during the Obama administration and continued by Trump during his first term, coupled with the availability of support services.
“The executive order would effectively criminalize homelessness and reduce support for incredibly effective programs that use a housing-first model. This does nothing less than suggest lessons from history, science and basic human compassion have been forgotten,” said Nancy Navarretta, the state commissioner of mental health and addiction services.
Jennifer Paradis, the executive director of an anti-poverty program in Milford and co-chair of CT CAN End Homelessness, suggested there was more to the issue than denouncing Trump.
“Homelessness is not criminal. Seeking community is not criminal. Poverty is not a crime. But let me be clear: Connecticut can do better, and we will,” Paradis said. 
“We have led our country in this work for many, many years, and now it is time to do it again, compassionately and collaboratively.”
Paradis, who glanced over her shoulder at Lamont at one point during her remarks, said relief to homelessness is in state hands.
“This is the moment in which we must maximize leverage for decriminalizing homelessness and funding services —”
Applause drowned out the rest of her sentence.
“To me, moments like this are not the work, all right? But it sets the tone for how we work moving forward,” Paradis said. “We know what we need. We know that homeless services are impactful but sorely under resourced. We know that housing ends homelessness, and we know that we will not stand for the slander, hateful and harmful policy that is this executive order.”
Thomas Burr, a Connecticut representative of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said the state has been a leader on fighting homelessness and providing mental health services.
“The previous administration of Gov. [Dannel P. ] Malloy, specifically, made significant investments in supportive housing, which was really a great thing to do, and we certainly celebrate that,” Burr said. “We celebrate the fact that Connecticut, back in 2015, was the first state to end chronic homelessness for veterans. That was huge.”
Burr, the father of a son who was homeless long ago as a consequence of mental illness, counseled against the president’s push for a greater reliance on involuntary treatment.
“Coercive treatment of any form is often traumatizing and counterproductive,” Burr said. “My son experienced this, and I have talked to more people who have had mental health and/or substance use issues who have found forced treatment to absolutely sour them on a medical model of treatment that has just delayed their paths of recovery.”
U.S. Reps. John B. Larson, D-1st District, and Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal also attended, emphasizing the immediate threat was from funding cuts that Trump can impose, not a directive to detain the homeless.
“This executive order is not law,” Blumenthal said. “It’s an edict from a lawless president.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source New Mexico)A nearly two-year court battle finally came to an end late last month, with a federal jude ruling — again — that the Federal Emergency Management Agency must pay Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims for the emotional toll of the state’s biggest-ever wildfire. 
The agency told Source New Mexico on Friday that it is still deciding whether to appeal the ruling, potentially beginning another multi-year court battle. 
 Plaintiffs initially sued FEMA in October 2023 for illegally withholding payments for the “noneconomic damages” they suffered in the wildfire, which means they weren’t compensated for the emotional toll of the fire. 
Judge James Browning ruled in favor of plaintiffs in December 2024 and, in a 142-page opinion issued July 18, denied FEMA and federal prosecutors’ push for him to reconsider key aspects of the prior ruling, which orders  FEMA to immediately pay both economic and “noneconomic” damages to victims. 
In the scar of New Mexico’s largest wildfire, a legal battle is brewing over the cost of suffering

The July 18 opinion could signal an end to the legal battle spanning two years in Browning’s courtroom, but it also could mean the beginning of a new one: FEMA and the United States Attorney’s Office have 60 days from the date of Browning’s latest ruling — Sept. 16 — to decide whether to appeal the case to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, according to FEMA and plaintiff’s attorney Brian S. Colón. 
An appeal could mean an additional delay of around two years, according to Ty Tosdal, another plaintiff’s lawyer. 
Neither the FEMA office overseeing a multi-billion-dollar compensation fund nor federal prosecutors would say whether they intend to appeal. In statements provided to Source NM, both offices said they are evaluating the decision. 
“FEMA will determine next steps and provide further information as it becomes available,” a spokesperson told Source via email on Friday. Acting United States Attorney Ryan Ellison is “reviewing the Court’s opinion,” said spokesperson Tessa Duberry.
Congress awarded FEMA $5.45 billion to compensate victims of the 2022 wildfire, minus administrative costs, because it resulted from two botched prescribed burns that the United States Forest Service ignited. The fire burned an area roughly 534 square miles, along with several hundred homes, and resulted in ongoing post-fire flooding in communities in and around the burn scar, including Las Vegas, N.M.
Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims still wait on FEMA’s decision to appeal judge’s ruling

Lawyers estimate that the total paid in “noneconomic” damages would be about one-tenth of the amount Congress awarded, amounting to about $545 million. According to the latest figures from the claims office, FEMA had paid out $2.782 billion in roughly 20,000 claims for damage as of July 29. 
Tosdal recently raised concerns about the long wait for resolution and compensation. He highlighted the case of one of his clients, Marianna Lands, who is dealing with the aftermath of a stroke that she said was caused by the stress of the fire. 
While fire victims wait for an answer, a claims office spokesperson said they don’t need to take any additional action on their claims regarding “noneconomic damages” and that it is steadily paying out other types of losses. 
“The Claims Office continues to compensate claimants for compensable losses,” the spokesperson said, and is doing so “to the maximum extent permissible.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hermits-Peak-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 16:57:12.184403

(Photo by Andrea Starr/ Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)National research laboratories in Colorado, Oregon and Washington focused on addressing climate change and its impacts and improving energy efficiency and affordability for Americans would be gutted under budgets proposed by President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.
The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, based in Richland, Washington and Portland, Oregon, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, would see their funding in the year ahead nearly halved under the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget for the U.S. Department of Energy. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are negotiating spending bills for the next fiscal year that begins in October and will decide on the energy agency’s budget after Sept. 2, when they return from their August recess.
The national labs are meant to lead research and scientific experimentation in climate and clean energy strategies, including measuring extreme weather risks by collecting and analyzing atmospheric data from around the world and improving battery and grid technologies to get more wind and solar energy flowing to homes and businesses. They also study energy efficiency across U.S. infrastructure and commerce, all of which is meant to save Americans and businesses money and to curb climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
Andrea McMakin, a former communications specialist and 34-year veteran of the Northwest Laboratory in Richland, said the U.S. risks losing its best scientists if the proposed funding cuts go through.
McMakin is part of the group Friends of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which has been raising concerns about the cuts. McMakin said the group learned in June that the lab’s former director told staff in a meeting that up to 1,000 people could be cut if the current budget passes, a number that’s been echoed by state leaders.
“Those people leave. They have to find jobs someplace. And we’re seeing that a lot of other countries are stepping up their recruiting to get U.S. scientists and engineers,” McMakin said. “We don’t want to see that. We want to keep our energy competitiveness and we want to keep our brain power here in the U.S.”
A recent report from Politico cites two sources familiar with U.S. Department of Energy facilities who said up to 1,000 people could be cut from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.
Heather Lammers, a spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the lab is talking with the federal energy department to fully understand the impacts of its proposed spending cuts.
The Northwest Laboratory’s public affairs officer, Dawn Zimmerman, did not confirm figures for potential staff cuts and said the U.S. Department of Energy requires all queries involving the federal budget to be directed to its public affairs office. An unnamed energy department spokesperson said in an email that personnel decisions are dictated by the labs directly, not the federal government.
“The Department of Energy is committed to making the American people’s government more efficient while also growing the output of top-quality science at our national labs,” the spokesperson wrote.
 Proposed cuts

Trump proposed in May cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. energy department by about $3.5 billion. Of that, $2.5 billion would be cut from the agency’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — a 74% reduction from its current budget.
The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, established following the 1973 oil crisis, in recent years has focused on researching, developing and deploying technologies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s electricity sector. That technology includes batteries that can hold large amounts of wind and solar power, and white LED light bulbs that require far less energy than incandescent and fluorescent lights.
The budget also cuts 14%, or $1.15 billion, from the department’s Biological and Environmental Research program, meant to collect and analyze climate change data.
Both the Colorado lab and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory get most of their funding from those two programs. But under Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, the Renewable Energy Lab would lose $387 million in funding – more than half of its current budget.
Lammers, the spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Lab, said it also receives funding from state and tribal governments and some private industry partners.
“We remain committed to our mission of delivering integrated solutions for an affordable, secure and reliable energy future through research, innovation and strategic collaboration,” she said.
The Northwest National Lab would lose about $280 million, a third of its current budget.
The lab, which employs more than 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Washington’s Tri-Cities area, which includes Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, according to the area’s development council.
 State lawmakers weigh in

Washington’s U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said the Republican budget for the energy department would be a “devastating blow” to the Northwest National Lab.
“Make no mistake: if Trump’s budget request were to become law, it would result in the loss of over 1,000 jobs at PNNL. On top of that, this administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs — this move alone could force major layoffs at PNNL,” she said in a statement.
Murray, the lead Democrat and vice chair on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she would fight the proposed cuts.
“President Trump’s budget is dead on arrival in the Senate as far as I’m concerned,” she said. “I’m working to write a bipartisan funding bill that will protect investments in our national labs and save the jobs President Trump is thoughtlessly seeking to eliminate.”
Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, said in an email the Republican budget is “anti-science” and will harm clean energy industries gaining traction and growing in parts of the state.
“I just had five town halls in eastern Oregon where wind turbines and solar panels are taking full advantage of renewable energy options that lower prices for consumers and fight the climate crisis,” Wyden said. “That’s but one clear example of how this latest Republican scheme to slash research investments in clean energy would be both nonsense and anti-science.”
Wyden said he voted against confirming oil executive Audrey Robertson as Trump’s appointee for assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the federal energy agency, in large part because Trump said he wanted to cut renewable energy investments.
Trump threatened nearly identical cuts for the energy department during his first presidency in 2017, but Congress ultimately ignored the president’s suggested budget for the agency. McMakin said she remembers staff of the Northwest National Lab starting to change the way they talked about their work so they wouldn’t draw Trump’s attention.
“I remember at that time it was like, we have to change. We can’t say ‘atmospheric climate science’ anymore, we have to say ‘earth sciences,’ because it was just one of those language things that if you said climate science or anything about climate you are in danger of getting your funding cut,” she said.

In a nine-page letter dated Aug. 1, state auditors say that among the programs the city has implemented that they want more information about are those addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion; transportation; homelessness; and the environment — or, as described in the letter, “The Green New Deal.”
The letter alleges that St. Pete taxpayers have seen their annual burden from property taxes increase by “over $95 million in the past six years, an increase of over 75%.”
Is that accurate? The city isn’t saying.
“We have received a follow-up letter from the State Division of Governmental Oversight and Efficiency and are reviewing it carefully,” Mayor Ken Welch said in a written statement. “The City of St. Petersburg will fully cooperate, providing any additional information or clarification as requested.”
DEI in the crosshairs
Officials from Broward County and Gainesville — the first two local governments targeted by Florida DOGE last month — said that the state had erred in some of its calculations about the level of local spending in the letters they received.
Regarding St. Petersburg’s DEI programs, the first ask by DOGE auditors is to find out “all jobs with the responsibility to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, or so-called anti-racism, whether or not within the Office of Equity or elsewhere.”
Officials also want to see “all official goals, policy statements, mission statements, positions, or commitments made by any office or department within St. Petersburg that included diversity, equity or inclusion, and all actions taken by those offices or department in support of those activities.”
Florida DOGE also wants to know of the names and qualifications of those who conducted DEI training and the names of those who attended those trainings.
Targeting the environment 
Regarding environmental initiatives, during former Mayor Rick Kriseman’s administration the city signed a pledge to transition from fossil fuels and toward a 100% renewable, zero-emissions energy future. Now Florida DOGE wants any documentation related to that pledge and all expenses associated with attempting to reach that goal.

In January 2019, the city was selected to participate in the American Cities Climate Challenge, an initiative backed by Bloomberg Philanthropies to tackle climate change and promote a sustainable future. Florida DOGE is now requesting “all actions, communications and expenditures to date in support” of that program.
And officials would like to know of any purchases or leases of electric vehicles (EV), “EV infrastructure, energy purchases associated with EV infrastructure, solar power systems, carbon credits, carbon charges, or other reduction mechanisms. ”
Mayor Welch added that “we will address any questions that may arise from the State’s process and move forward with clarity and accountability in the best interest of the residents of St. Petersburg.”
‘This is serious’
Some city council members expressed concern upon learning of the DOGE requests.
“This is serious. There’s a major chance that funding for DEI roles and parades can be cut,” said St. Petersburg City Councilmember Corey Givens Jr., referring to funding the city gives every year to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day and St. Pete Pride events.
Tampa Bay-area state Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner ripped the DeSantis administration after learning of the audit, scheduled to take place on Aug. 13 and 14.
“This isn’t fiscal oversight, it’s political retaliation. And the cost falls on working families who depend on local services to survive and thrive,” Rayner said in a statement. “If we’re serious about responsible budgeting, we should be solving Florida’s housing and insurance crisis, investing in strong public education, and working around the clock to bring down everyday costs. That’s how we build a Florida that works for all of us.”
She went on to say that if Desantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia “were serious about reducing wasteful spending and helping working-class Floridians, they would start with cutting all tax breaks to billionaires and publicly traded companies, then they would help underserved communities throughout the state recover from storms and work to fix our state’s broken insurance system so people can still afford to live here.”
DOGE emerged from a DeSantis executive order and legislation signed by the governor earlier this year. Failure by municipal leaders to cooperate could bring costly fines.

(Photo courtesy of Butte County Office of Education)Victoria Gomez de la Torre doesn’t know when — or if — the migrant children she serves are going to get the education help they’ve come to rely on.
Gomez de la Torre oversees the migrant education program for 12 central Florida counties. The federally funded service helps the children of migrant agricultural workers, who move within and between states based on planting and harvesting seasons.
Her staff identifies agricultural workers who’ve migrated to the area and helps them enroll their children in school. It also helps connect them with tutoring and medical care.
Earlier this summer, the Trump administration froze more than $6 billion in education funding, including money for migrant education, after-school programs, English-language programs for non-native speakers and other grants. Congress had already approved the money, but the administration said it wanted to conduct a review of the programs.
The administration announced last Friday it would release the remaining $5.5 billion of the money, after unfreezing $1.3 billion earlier this month.
But for Gomez de la Torre’s program, the damage had already been done: Without the money, it had to shut down this summer.
“We didn’t have enough money left over to carry the program,” said Joram Rejouis, the director of program development for the public schools in Alachua County, which includes Gainesville and is the largest of the 12 counties. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage.”
The program came to a complete halt when Gomez de la Torre’s 11 staff members were offered other positions in the school district. Throughout July, about five dozen migrant children across the 12 counties were without summer services. The funds were supposed to go out before the start of the month.
“It’s going horrendously,” said Gomez de la Torre. “Migrant families depend on us, rely on our system and our help.”
The Alachua County program serves about 1,000 to 1,200 children of migrant workers throughout the year, many in rural farming communities. Each year, roughly 17,000 migrant children are served by programs across Florida.
“It is a very valuable program for a very vulnerable population,” Rejouis said. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.”
Migrant children are less likely to have regular primary care and are more likely to face health conditions such as anemia and high blood pressure. Many migrant families who harvest food in the fields don’t have enough food themselves.
The program also helps with communication and translation among parents, teachers and guidance counselors. “We were their go-to for whenever they needed something,” Gomez de la Torre said. “Now, they don’t have us.”










Stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.

The freeze in funds added to the uncertainty and fear created by the Trump administration’s broader moves to target benefits for immigrants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently announced it had added Head Start to the list of public programs that would be closed to immigrants who are here illegally. After the funding announcement earlier this month, a senior official said the administration had established “guardrails” to ensure the funds are not used “in violation of Executive Orders.”
“It’s anybody’s guess when we’ll come back,” Gomez de la Torre said. “If we’ll come back. If people who chose to retire will return, if their retirement can be rescinded. … Nobody knows exactly how it’s going to play out.”
A similar story is unfolding in California.
The statewide Mini Corps program, run by the Butte County Office of Education, north of Sacramento, connects migrant children at schools and labor camps with bilingual tutors who help them during the school day. Many of the tutors are former migrant children themselves, said Yvette Medina, who oversees the program.
The funding freeze forced the office to lay off around 400 workers statewide, according to spokesperson Travis Souders. Despite Friday’s announcement, the organization is waiting for official word — in writing — before reversing layoffs.
“There’s going to be many students out there who are just going to have another disadvantage to the disadvantages that we already have,” Medina said.
In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, the program was forced to shut down altogether, according to Medina.
Medina grew up in migrant labor camps, following her parents to the fields at 4 a.m. as they picked cherries and grapes before she went to school. Her parents worked throughout the Central Valley, back in Mexico and up and down the West Coast, all the way to Oregon.
“It is devastating,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the migrant program, I know for a fact there’s no way I would have graduated high school.”
Migrant families already are gripped with fear as the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids and arrests, which President Donald Trump insists are focused on those with criminal histories.
“They are terrified,” Gomez de la Torre said. “We had families stop sending kids to school and others who fled the country.”
Ruby Luis, a consultant who helps school districts across Florida identify and enroll migrant students in school, also was a migrant child. Her parents worked in orange groves, at strawberry and Christmas tree farms and produce-packing houses.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

Program tutors read books with her and gave her school supplies. The program took her on college tours and she enrolled via a scholarship for migrant children — a first-generation college student. She eventually graduated with a degree in biology.
“Just having even somebody to talk to you about going to college — because you don’t have anybody to talk to about [that],” she said. “Having that support was really impactful.
“To take that away, and then now they just have to navigate it themselves, it creates these barriers,” Luis said. “And it can ultimately leave these children not having access to education.”

Iowa House Republicans elected Kaufmann to lead the caucus through the remainder of the 91st General Assembly. Though the announcement makes the leadership change official, the news was expected as President Donald Trump referred to Kaufmann as “majority leader-elect” during his July 3 speech at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, more than a month in advance of the actual vote.
Kaufmann, the son of Iowa Republican Party chair Jeff Kaufmann, began serving in the Iowa House in 2013. He has held multiple leadership roles as chairs of the House State Government and Government Oversight committees, and most recently has served as the Ways and Means Committee chair since 2022. Outside of the Legislature, he served as a senior advisor for Trump’s 2024 Iowa caucus campaign.

House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a statement Monday he is looking forward to working with Kaufmann “to advance our caucus’s shared vision for Iowa.”
“I’ve served in the Iowa House with Representative Kaufmann for many years now and have seen him grow into a leader for our caucus,” Grassley said. “I have seen many examples of how his bold leadership style has brought the caucus together toward meaningful legislation to move our state forward.”
Since 2019, the House GOP leadership was led by Grassley as speaker and Windschitl as majority leader. But Windschitl is stepping down from legislative leadership role as the Missouri Valley veteran seeks election to the U.S. House. In July, Windschitl announced his run for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District. The seat is currently held by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who launched an “exploratory” committee running for Iowa governor following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to not seek reelection.
As he takes over Windschitl’s position as majority leader, Kaufmann said he will work through the position on issues that matter to Iowans.
“I am honored by the trust placed in me by my colleagues to serve as Majority Leader,” Kaufmann said in a statement. “This is a role I will not take lightly. I am committed to uniting our caucus to advance policies that strengthen our economy, support our families, and ensure our children will have bright futures. I look forward to working with Speaker Grassley to address the challenges and opportunities facing Iowa with bold, practical solutions.”
Iowa House Democratic Leader Brian Meyer, who took over as the minority party leader from Rep. Jennifer Konfrst, D-Des Moines, as she runs for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, congratulated Kaufmann’s election in a Monday statement.
“I have served alongside Representative Kaufmann for many years, and I trust he will ensure every voice, including those across the aisle, is heard,” Meyer said. “I look forward to a respectful and constructive working relationship with the new Majority Leader. Iowa faces critical issues, like property tax reform, public education funding, and economic struggles, and these challenges demand bipartisan solutions. It is my sincere hope that the Iowa House can rise above partisan divisions and deliver meaningful results for all Iowans.”

Dooley announced his campaign with a video message Tuesday morning. In it, Dooley pays homage to his late father, the legendary University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley; praises President Donald Trump and attacks Ossoff as out of step with Georgians.
“Professional politicians like Jon Ossoff are the problem,” Dooley said. “Lawlessness, open season on the border, inflation everywhere, woke stuff, that’s what they represent. We need new leadership in Georgia. That’s why I’m running for Senate.”
The Kemp-Trump Connection

Dooley is reportedly running with the backing of Gov. Brian Kemp, a family friend who this spring announced he would not be seeking the seat. But Dooley joins a GOP primary that already includes two strong competitors, U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins.
Dooley, who has never held elected office before, pledged to be a political outsider in the vein of Trump and work to support the president’s agenda.
“Football is a lot like life,” Dooley said in a statement. “It doesn’t always go your way, but when you get knocked down, you learn how to keep fighting through adversity and working hard to win. That’s the American Spirit, too. But leadership matters! Under President Trump’s leadership, the American Spirit is on its way back. And that’s what I want for all Georgians.”

Both Collins and Carter can justifiably claim to be strong allies of the MAGA movement, and they have also striven to appeal to the president — but Trump has yet to make an endorsement.
Following Dooley’s announcement, Collins came out swinging with an ad casting Dooley as a new passenger on the Trump train.
  Georgia Republican Congressman Mike Collins. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“When shots rang out in Butler and Trump rose to his feet in defiant triumph, rallying all patriotic Americans, Derek Dooley was nowhere to be found,” the ad says, referencing last year’s assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. “Not a word, not a penny of support, didn’t lift a finger to help Donald Trump and the America first agenda win the fight. Derek Dooley has spent his life on the sidelines avoiding the fight to save America. Derek Dooley never fights, never wins, never Trump.”
Carter’s campaign struck a similar tone.
“Georgians know the difference between a fighter who stands with Trump versus a product of the same establishment machine that tried to stop him. Buddy Carter has stood with Trump from Day One, and will stand with him every day in the U.S. Senate,” a campaign spokesperson said in a statement.

Reporting from the Washington Examiner found that Dooley didn’t vote in several presidential elections, did not register as a Republican in multiple states and has not donated to the president’s campaigns.
Kemp pledged to work with Trump to find a candidate with a strong chance of success. A candidate endorsed by both Kemp and Trump would be seen as a likely frontrunner in the Republican primary, but the two have a complicated relationship.
Their once sweet partnership soured after Kemp declined to back Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and in 2022,Trump backed former Republican Sen. David Perdue as a primary challenger to Kemp, who easily swatted Perdue away.
Trump’s endorsement helped former UGA football star Herschel Walker earn the GOP nomination in a doomed 2022 challenge against Warnock. Walker fell flat in the general election, significantly underperforming Kemp, who cruised to a solid re-election.
Trump had also previously backed former Congressman Doug Collins in a primary challenge against former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed by Kemp and went on to lose to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in the same 2021 runoff in which Ossoff narrowly won his seat.
‘Failed and Fired’

In a statement, Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey poked fun at Dooley’s coaching record.
“This chaotic, crowded Republican primary just got messier with the entrance of failed and fired former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, who has failed to live up to his family name throughout his career,” Bailey said. “We’ll see what’s harder for Dooley — answering for a Trump bill that strips health care for 750,000 Georgians, or remembering which SEC team to root for.”
Dooley was fired in 2012 after “posting Tennessee’s longest run of consecutive losing seasons in over a century,” according to the Associated Press. Dooley went on to work as a wide receivers coach for the Dallas Cowboys and as an assistant coach for the New York Giants.
As the only Democratic senator up for re-election in a state Trump won in 2024, Ossoff has a major target on his back.
Republicans are hoping that Georgia voters will show that his election was a fluke, while Democrats hope that a bruising primary and a backlash against the party in control of the White House will help earn Ossoff six more years.
Another thing that could help is the massive pile of cash Ossoff is sitting on – as of July, Ossoff’s campaign claimed nearly $15.5 million cash on hand, Federal Election Commission data shows.
Ossoff has raised nearly $42 million dollars this cycle – more than any other Senate candidate, according to FEC data. The second-place fundraiser, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, raised $25.9 million.
With the party primaries set for May, Republicans still have time to catch up, and the eventual GOP candidate is also likely to see a big campaign haul.
For now, Carter reported a war chest of just over $4 million, according to paperwork filed in May, and as of July, Collins reported sitting on just over $1 million in campaign funds.

(Courtesy of the Arkansas National Guard)More than 230 Arkansas National Guardsmen and law enforcement officers completed biennial civil disturbance training Saturday at North Little Rock’s Burns Park, according to a press release. 
Arkansas State Police, North Little Rock, Little Rock, and Conway police department officers joined guardsmen from the 189th Airlift Wing, 188th Security Forces Squadron and the 216th Military Police Company to train on de-escalation, limited visibility, gas masks, infrastructure protection, tear gas and other non-lethal systems, according to the release. 
“Joint Domestic Operations preparedness is paramount to the state of Arkansas in the event our agencies are required to respond to a real-world crisis or civil disturbance in one of our urban centers,” said Maj. Nathan Sosebee, 188th Security Forces Squadron commander and lead planner for the exercise. “It is critical to train as a joint force to ensure the safety of our communities and the rights of our citizens are protected, while at the same time upholding law and order according to Arkansas state laws and the U.S. Constitution.”
The National Guard Quick Response Force consists of the 189th Security Forces Squadron, 188th SFS, and the 216th MP Co. Those military units are required to train together annually, according to an Arkansas National Guard concept plan. The military units are required to conduct a validation exercise every other year with the Arkansas State Police since the quick response group’s establishment in 2016, according to the release. 
This group has been activated twice since 2020, both times after the deaths of civilians at the hands of police. It was called to duty and stationed in West Memphis, as a precautionary measure to support Arkansas State Police in January 2023 in response to the death of Memphis, Tennessee, resident Tyre Nichols. The group was also called to state active duty in May 2020 and deployed for nine days to support Arkansas State Police near the state Capitol after the death of George Floyd, according to the press release.
Biennial training events like last weekend’s help agencies determine whether “our safety equipment, communications devices, tactics, procedures, and ability to deploy with each other and with other agencies are effective,” said Sgt. Justin Cross, North Little Rock Investigations Division sergeant and commander of the North Little Rock Police Department Special Response Team. 
Exercise participants faced real-world situations, and the exercise accounted for simulated injuries to soldiers and law enforcement personnel that prompted an emergency medical response, according to the release. Opposing forces were played by on-duty military and civilian police officers dressed in civilian attire who performed as aggressors in the scenarios.
“The exercise has built into the most robust event we have had since the state formed a Domestic Operations Response Force in 2016,” Sosebee said.

A coalition of 15 state attorneys general have filed a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s effort to restrict access to medically-necessary care for transgender, intersex and nonbinary youth.
The lawsuit challenges recent federal action to deter doctors and medical providers from offering gender affirming care to youth under the age of 19 years old, including states like Michigan where that care is legal and protected.
Joining the suit are the attorneys general of Michigan, New York, California, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.

“The Trump administration shouldn’t be interfering with the provision of health care,” said Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul in a statement Friday. “The administration should be respecting individual liberty and equal rights, not shamefully targeting transgender people.”
The attorneys general have asserted that President Donald Trump’s White House is overstepping its authority, using threats of criminal prosecution and federal investigations to pressure health care providers.
“The Trump Administration is attempting to strip away lawful, essential healthcare from vulnerable youth. These orders are illegal and dangerous and have no medical or scientific basis,” said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in a statement. “I will continue to protect families, defend doctors, and stop politicians from putting our kids’ lives at risk.”
Trump in the beginning of his second administration signed an executive order stating that the U.S. would only recognize two sexes, and called for an end to what Trump labeled “gender ideology.” A second order focused on medical restrictions, directing the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue enforcement actions related to that care.
Since then, Nessel’s office said the Department of Justice has issued subpoenas to providers under the guise of criminal law enforcement, but the attorneys general filing the lawsuit Friday argue those efforts lack legal standing and are intended only to intimidate.
“Health care decisions for kids should be made by parents and doctors, not by politicians,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group, in a statement. “The federal government is using funding as a weapon to force providers to abandon their patients and override parents’ rights to make health care decisions for their own children.”
Patricia Wells, a doctor and the medical director of The Corner Health Center in Ypsilanti, Michigan, said in a statement that she and her colleagues are distressed by new punitive changes to funding and regulations, which threaten to dismantle essential care.
“These policies do not protect children; they endanger them,” Wells said. “They undermine trust in the medical system and place affirming providers in an impossible position, forcing hospitals to close clinics and providers to stop offering the very care that helps young people survive and thrive. The loss of these services would not simply be a policy failure; it would be a moral one.”
Wells said the nation must do better.
“These young people deserve our compassion, our evidence-based care, and our unwavering commitment to their well-being,” she said. “I applaud the leadership of the state of Michigan for protecting transgender and gender nonconforming youth, their families, and the caregivers who are saving lives every day.”

Lawmakers and advocates say it’ll be back next year.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Katy Golvala to discuss her article written with Laura Tillman, “Lamont nixed overdose prevention centers, but advocates fight on,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Katy and Laura’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Katy. Could you start by describing an overdose prevention center and what prompted you and your colleague, Laura Tillman, to be interested in telling the story of how a proposal for an OPC in Connecticut was derailed in the state house after winning approval in the Senate?
KG: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So, an overdose prevention center is a physical space that is a resource for people who use drugs, and so it can contain a lot of things, as advocates will tell you. Oftentimes, they contain a space for people to just sit and get out of the cold. Maybe they can get a cup of coffee, access laundry, access showers, bathrooms, and medical care. But the most controversial piece of it is that they include safe use areas, so areas where people can bring illegal drugs that they have obtained and use them under the supervision of trained staff who have access to oxygen, Naloxone, and tools that would help them prevent and reverse overdoses. And this bill came up in Connecticut for the second time. The first time it came up was in 2023 to establish overdose prevention centers that include all of those other resources and areas where people can safely use under supervision.
WSHU: That’s a very controversial part of this, allowing people to use drugs in these centers.
KG: Yes, the safe use element is controversial. I think all of the other elements, people generally agree that all of those are tools that should be used in the fight against overdoses. But what I will say is, you know, this is a relatively new concept in the United States. There is one center in Rhode Island and two in New York City, but it is widely used worldwide. There are over 100 around the world, with over 30 in Canada. And we spoke to people on the ground floor, establishing them in Canada, as well as people who were part of the early processes for Rhode Island and New York. And you know what we found was interesting. They start off controversial with the public, which is definitely what we heard. But if the right kind of community outreach is done if you know the evidence is presented oftentimes that can help to sway public opinion.
So we talked to a woman who was part of organizing the center in Vancouver, and it started out with the surrounding community being very much against the idea, and then they took a survey several months after the center had opened, and a majority of the public was on board with the idea. Because what they found is that not only do the centers decrease public use, but people can also go into the overdose prevention center to use, and it also takes care of, you know, cleaning up drug paraphernalia that would be associated with drug use on the street, like needles. And it also did not increase crime in the immediate surrounding area.
WSHU: Did it increase the use of drugs, the use of illegal drugs? Did that increase? That’s a real concern: if you make it safe for people to use illegal drugs, there might be more drug use.
KG: I think that might be pretty hard to measure, because people are hesitant to admit illegal drug use. However, the results from the centers that have been established and the studies that have been done show that people who use the centers do increase uptake of treatment services. So we can’t say for sure whether this increases or decreases drug use. But a hesitation we heard from the Republicans on the Public Health Committee, who almost unanimously voted against this measure, even though it passed out of committee, was, you know, does this encourage drug use instead of encouraging treatment? And at least some of the studies we’ve seen suggest that it encourages treatment, seeking treatment. What we’ll hear from a lot of advocates is that their number one goal is to prevent death. And of all the overdose prevention centers in the world, there is no record of a death at an overdose prevention center. So you can imagine all the deaths that occur outside an overdose prevention center. And so what advocates will say is the bottom line is we’re trying to reduce death, and death is not happening at these places.
WSHU: Now, the fact that the bill did not make it this time around, this last session was pretty much driven by Governor Ned Lamont’s (D) opposition. You talked with the governor. What did he have to say? Why was it because of community concerns? Why did he feel we should put the brakes and wait and see on this?
KG: Yeah, so the governor said he actually didn’t hear any overwhelming community concern. The public hearing for this bill was eight hours long, and it was mostly about this bill, and not one person testified against it. And he admitted it was not like people were banging on his office door saying, Don’t bring these to Connecticut. His concern was, really, that it was still the early days. And that’s true in the United States. It is still early days.
WSHU: But we have Rhode Island right here, and they started this year.
KG: They started in January.
WSHU: Okay, so there wasn’t enough time to really study it and see.
KG: Yes. So essentially, his point is that it’s still early days. Let’s see how New York and Rhode Island get on, and let’s take it from there.
WSHU: What’s the difference between Rhode Island and New York? Are they pretty much running the same type of facilities in both states?
KG: They’re running very similar facilities. I would say the key difference we heard from elected officials in each place was the way that these overdose prevention centers were established. So in Rhode Island, this took multiple years to pass in the Rhode Island legislature, and then nonprofits had to bid for the contract to actually open it. Project Weber/RENEW, the nonprofit in Rhode Island, won that contract; they had to find a location and get a favorable vote from the Providence City Council. And they really were, you know, we heard from the councilwoman where this center is in her ward, and she said they were relentless in terms of showing up to community meetings, educating people on the benefits of these centers. And eventually, they found a location that was in the Medical District in Providence. It’s literally called the hospital district. Laura and I got a chance to visit it, and it really hits you when you’re driving into it. There are no schools, there are no commercial businesses. There is, you know, a spinal center and an OBGYN.
WSHU: Does it stand out? If you didn’t know there was an overdose prevention center there?
KG: You wouldn’t know, wouldn’t know what it was.
WSHU: You wouldn’t see people hanging outside? Because that’s one of the concerns of communities, it will attract people to hang out on the streets, etc.
KG: Nope, on our way in, we didn’t see anyone hanging out outside. On our way out, there were a few, a handful of people outside. But it’s not like they are using the drugs outdoors. It’s the way you might see a few people hanging out outside a community center. So no, it’s just not. It doesn’t stand out in the area at all. It looks like just another medical facility. And the Councilwoman we spoke with in Rhode Island said that the location was part of what convinced her.
Things were done pretty differently in New York City. So on the last day of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, he announced that two of these would go up in New York City, and he announced which neighborhoods they would be in. And the Councilwoman we spoke with there said she found out on the same day as all her constituents that one would be going up in her neighborhood in Washington Heights, and she said she still gets complaints from people. Also, you know, New York is much more dense. It’s more difficult to find a hospital district-type location. So this did end up going right alongside one of the community’s biggest and most popular parks, which caused a lot of issues in the beginning. She said that things have gotten better, and she would still, she still thinks that the overdose prevention center is a net positive, but she wonders what it would have been like, how the community would be reacting if there was buy-in like there was in Providence.
WSHU: Now, Katy, what is the advocacy community? What are they doing now that this bill failed this year? Have they got plans to reintroduce it? What’s going on regarding their feelings about getting this done in Connecticut?
KG: I do think the plan is to continue to reintroduce it. One advocate suggested that there should be a special session, so they are committed to this. State Senator Anwar and Representative McCarthy Vahey, the co-chairs of the Public Health Committee, are both very much committed to this idea. And Representative McCarthy Vahey, on the day that the bill went through without the overdose prevention center measure, said, This is day one of the next effort, basically. So there is an appetite, certainly, to reintroduce.
WSHU: And Lamont, does he have an open mind? Is he prepared to consider it?
KG: Our conversation with Governor Lamont suggests he definitely has an open mind. He said, “This is not a hell no, this is just a wait and see.” So we will wait and see.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAFE-CONSUMPTION-SITES-0716-SR-22-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 16:57:12.184403

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

(Photo by Gerry Images)Florida Department of Health officials said Monday there have been 21 cases of  Campylobacter and E. coli infections tied to raw milk consumption in the central and northeast portion of the state, and seven people have been hospitalized.
The agency said the tainted milk was “linked to a particular farm” but did not disclose the name or location.
“Sanitation practices in this farm are of particular concern due to the number of cases,” the DOH said in the Monday bulletin.
Of the 21 cases, severe complications have been reported in at least two. Six of the cases were reported in children under the age of 10. 
Raw milk comes directly from the cow, sheep, goat, or other animals and doesn’t go through a heating process, known as pasteurization, to kill bacteria. As such, raw milk can contain campylobacter, Escherichia coli (E. coli), listeria, and salmonella, which can cause gastrointestinal illness, including diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. 
The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention notes that children under 5, adults over 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk of serious illness from these germs.
In Florida, raw milk can only be sold for non-human consumption as pet or animal food, which is regulated by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Florida law requires containers of raw milk to carry a label clearly stating that the raw milk is for animal consumption only.
The Ladapo way

The DOH, headed by Dr. Joseph Ladapo, did not recommend against drinking raw milk. 
“Floridians are encouraged to use this information to make informed decisions about their health and sources of raw milk should they choose to consume it,” the bulletin notes.
Gov. Ron DeSantis hired Ladapo, who had been on the medical school faculty of the University of California at Los Angeles, to run the DOH in 2021. The agency secretary doubles as state surgeon general and Ladapo also fills a position at the University of Florida.
During his time in the DeSantis administration, Ladapo has expressed deep skepticism of Covid-19 vaccines and the efficacy of face masks to limit exposure to viruses. He made national headlines in 2021 when he refused to don a mask during a meeting with state Sen. Tina Polsky, who was being treated for cancer and requested that he wear one. At the time, Ladapo was up for Senate confirmation.
Ladapo last year advised parents that it was up to them to decide whether to keep their children at home amid a measles outbreak in Broward County — counter to usual practice and guidance from the CDC urging parents to keep unvaccinated children at home. And it  was Ladapo’s agency that  before the 2024 general election sent warning letters to television stations airing ads urging passage of Amendment 4, the initiative that would have guaranteed access to abortion.

(Provided/Department of Transportation)In these contentious times, perhaps we can all agree on at least one thing: Bridges are not supposed to fall down.
I mention this fact because we should not underestimate the significance of the recent partial bridge collapse in Pickens County.
It’s the canary in the coal mine, a warning.
The photos are disturbing. Take a good look at them.
We should keep them in mind.
Experts have warned us for years about the poor quality of South Carolina’s roads and bridges, hinting perhaps that something like the partial bridge collapse could happen.
And it happened. Luckily, no one was injured or killed.
It would be a mistake to dismiss this as a freak occurrence rather than recognizing it as a symptom of legislative neglect.
The state Highway 133 (Crowe Creek Road) bridge was 57 years old and slated to be replaced later this year. Because of its age and condition, it was load restricted, meaning trucks and other heavy vehicles were not supposed to use it, as the SC Daily Gazette’s Skylar Laird reported.
But a truck weighing more than the posted 15-ton limit crossed it anyway and apparently caused the collapse.
We can blame an irresponsible driver, but we should not overlook the fact that about a third of the 8,400 state-maintained bridges are, like the Highway 133 bridge, near or past their intended lifespan.
About 500 bridges date back at least 90 years. That’s cause for deep concern.
For decades, state lawmakers have failed to adequately fund road and bridge maintenance and replacement.
Our South Carolina roads and bridges are often ranked among the worst in the nation. Likewise, the poor quality of our roads contributes to a high motorist fatality rate.
Fixing state roads and bridges is not just about saving wear and tear on our cars. It’s about saving lives.
And it’s a fundamental responsibility of state government to make sure our roads and bridges are safe. It’s not liberal or conservative. It’s just good government.
Most South Carolinians keenly understand our road and bridge problems.
It’s a common complaint, heard everywhere: “We have lousy roads.”
We drive on those roads. We know what we’re talking about.
The frog in the pot
Too many of us accept it as a fact of life that South Carolina has always had bad roads and bridges and always will have bad roads and bridges — as if it’s fate or the will of a malign deity.
Sure, we grumble about the roads, but not loudly enough. Our expectations of state leaders are much too low.
We need to realize that bridge collapses like the one in Pickens County actually are rare in the United States, especially considering that there are more than 600,000 bridges across the country.
Most bridges are regularly inspected and maintained according to strict federal and state guidelines. (We should remember this next time a politician uses “cutting regulations” as an applause line.)
But a 2021 study by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave South Carolina a D+ for infrastructure overall — more specifically, a D for roads and a C for bridges.
That report identified almost 11% of South Carolina bridges as structurally deficient, higher than the national average of 7.5%.
Another study put the number of structurally deficient bridges in the state at 745. A 2022 survey ranked South Carolina near the top, No. 9, for the worst roads in the nation.
Legislators have made some progress on improving our roads and bridges in recent years, but it’s not enough to make up for decades of underfunding.
A bold new plan called Momentum 2050 offers great hope for upgrading our roads. But it carries a price tag of $1 billion additional yearly, and there’s no plan to fund it, as SC Daily Gazette Editor Seanna Adcox pointed out in a detailed commentary tracing the history of our road woes.
Redoubling efforts
State leaders must redouble their efforts to protect South Carolinians on the roads.
New revenues may be needed. One thing state leaders shouldn’t do is cut taxes by $1 billion, as they have in recent years, when our infrastructure is in terrible shape. They shouldn’t prioritize tax cuts over public safety.
In addition, state lawmakers should consider raising the gas tax again. That would require considerable political will, particularly in an election year. Yet, hope springs eternal.
South Carolina’s gas tax is still fairly modest. As of January 2024, it ranked 29th in the nation at 28.75 cents per gallon, compared to neighboring Georgia’s 33.05 cents per gallon and North Carolina’s 40.65 cents.
The time is ripe for these discussions. With an election year approaching, politicking has already begun with five Republican candidates running for governor so far.
Roads and bridges should be a central part of the debate. Strong-willed leadership is needed in Columbia.
In the rush of news, we should all be concerned that this partial bridge collapse might be quickly forgotten.
Instead, it should become the poster child that spurs bridge and road improvement in South Carolina.
It’ll be up to South Carolinians to keep roads and bridges front and center on the state’s agenda.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed.png,,,2025-08-04 15:57:35.954683

(Photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has joined a coalition of 16 states and Washington seeking to stop the Trump administration from disallowing treatments for transgender youth, including surgeries and drug-based treatments like puberty blockers.
The 111-page complaint filed Friday in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi targets Executive Order 14,187 — signed by Trump within a week of his taking office — and enforcement actions taken since then by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The multistate coalition is seeking an injunction to block the order’s enforcement. 
The Jan. 28 executive order directed federal agencies to halt funding, insurance coverage, and institutional support for gender-affirming care for individuals under the age of 19. Gender-affirming care can include pharmacological and surgical treatments, or, in the order’s language, “chemical and surgical mutilation.” 
The Federal Register titles the executive order as “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” but the multistate suit calls it the “Denial of Care Order” and criticizes it as an unlawful maneuver which intimidates providers and overrides states’ own authority to regulate medical treatments. 
On April 22, Bondi issued a directive asking federal prosecutors to investigate providers for off-label use of puberty blockers and hormone therapy, encouraging whistleblower suits, and purging federal acknowledgement of transgender health guidelines from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). The six-page memo also proposed legislation that would enable families to retroactively sue providers for transgender surgeries, with eventual penalties modeled on existing ones for female genital mutilation.
The suit cites a mix of 13 providers, health systems, and insurers nationwide that discontinued, paused, or scaled back gender-affirming care in the wake of Bondi’s order. It also cited California insurer Kaiser Permanente’s announcement that it will stop covering gender-affirming surgeries on Aug. 29, 2025, 
“This dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation’s history, and it must end,” Trump’s executive order reads. “Countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding.”
Neronha, in a statement Friday, rejected that interpretation.
“Let’s get clear on what gender affirming care is, and what it isn’t,” Neronha said. “Gender affirming care is medically necessary, and in some cases lifesaving treatment for kids who, with their parents, are just trying to find their way in this world, no different than anyone else.”
“The decision of whether or not a child should receive gender affirming care needs to be made between the child, their family, and their doctor — not the federal government,” Neronha continued. “It isn’t a decision these kids and their families take lightly, it isn’t mutilation, and it isn’t dangerous.”
The lawsuit marks the 32nd multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration Neronha has led or joined.
Attorneys general involved in the latest lawsuit over gender affirming care include those in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Wisconsin. Also a plaintiff on behalf of his state is Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. 
The lawsuit cites recent estimates of the trans population in the U.S. as about 1.3 million adults, or 0.5% of the nation’s population. In the age group of 13- to 17-year-olds, that number is proportionally much higher, with about 1.4%, or 300,000 youths, identifying as transgender.
“In all Plaintiff States, residents who are 18 years old are legal adults who have legal authority to make medical decisions for themselves,” the suit reads. 
The lawsuit notes that puberty blockers and hormone therapy are prescribed based on clinical appropriateness and a patient’s age, while interventions like chest masculinization, also known as top surgery, are uncommon and reserved for older teenagers and adults. Children who haven’t entered puberty are only recommended for social transition, which can consist of changes in name, pronouns, or clothing, the lawsuit states 
The federal narrative, however, cites examples of recipients later regretting their choice, such as the case of Chloe Cole, a California teenager who underwent a double mastectomy at 15 and has since publicly detransitioned. Data from a 2021 meta-analysis of nearly 8,000 patients who received gender-affirming surgery has regret rates of less than 1%.
Included in Neronha’s Friday statement were sentiments of support for the suit from Care New England and the Rhode Island Medical Society.
No hearing date has been scheduled yet, but the case has been assigned to District Judge Angel Kelley in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

In a press release, the authority said a total of $400,000 in tax revenue that was captured from former land bank-owned properties will be directed to the Oakland County Housing Trust Fund. The first $250,000 of that total has already been contributed after the state land bank authority partnered with the Oakland County Brownfield Development Authority to convert a former sand and gravel pit in Commerce Township to The Reserve at Crystal Lake, a 203-lot market rate housing development currently under construction.  
“The Reserve at Crystal Lake provides another exceptional example of the State Land Bank Authority’s commitment to putting unproductive property back on tax rolls,” Joseph Rivet, director of the Michigan State Land Bank Authority said. “At the same time, we are creatively targeting our resources to further workforce housing development here and throughout Michigan.”  
The funding is obtained by the authority by collecting a share of property tax revenue for five years after selling land bank-owned properties. Although the Commerce Township site wasn’t developed as affordable housing, the authority says it is upholding its broader commitment to housing access by redirecting tax revenue from the project. 
“This investment from the State Land Bank Authority will have a meaningful impact on addressing the demand for affordable housing in Oakland County,” Oakland County Housing Officer Khadija Walker-Fobbs said. “By reinvesting tax revenue from a market-rate development into our Housing Trust Fund, we are strengthening our communities and making them more livable.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)FORDYCE, Ark. — The man convicted of murdering four people and attempting to murder another 11 at the Mad Butcher grocery store in Fordyce last summer was sentenced Monday to four life sentences, plus 220 years, without the possibility of parole.
Travis Posey, 46, of New Edinburg, accused of opening fire in the parking lot and inside the store, entered a guilty plea last month after accepting a deal in which prosecutors removed the death penalty.
Accounts from Posey’s victims and their families dominated the 90-minute hearing. They described how his actions on June 21, 2024, had scarred and traumatized them and the town of Fordyce.

Posey’s motive, if he had one, was never detailed by the prosecution or defense teams prior to his guilty plea. Many of the 15 people who stood and spoke or submitted written statements to be read aloud demanded answers from the man who took their loved ones and left the community traumatized.
The victims described unimaginable grief, sleepless nights and a pervasive loss of safety in their daily lives as some of the lingering consequences of Posey’s actions. Some of the wounded said they are still healing from their injuries. Another said she became so depressed she had to be hospitalized.
Angela Atchley, the daughter of Shirley Kay Taylor, one of the four killed in the shooting, said in a written statement read aloud before the court that her mother never failed to make “sure we knew we were loved unconditionally.”
“Our lives were shattered that day,” Atchley wrote. “Mr. Posey, why won’t you tell us why? We deserve to know.”
Kacey Harbour was visibly angry, her voice shaking as she took to the stand. She identified herself as the cashier manning register 4 inside the Mad Butcher when Posey opened fire.
“You’re a cesspool, not a man,” Harbour said, before comparing him to bacteria and scum. She said she couldn’t forgive him, and likely never would.
Helen Browning-Grice, the mother of Callie Weems, another of the four killed, described her grief at losing her daughter, a nurse who died trying to attend to those wounded during the shooting, and of the agony of one day having to tell Weems’ baby daughter how her mother died.
“I cannot forgive you at this time,” Brown said, but added she hoped Posey found Jesus during his imprisonment.
Hanna Sturgis, the daughter of Roy Sturgis, said her father was a hard-working man who had always been her rock. Her father, she said, had been buying steak at the Mad Butcher for their weekly Sunday steak dinner when he was shot and killed. Now Roy Sturgis would not get to see his daughter walk down the aisle, or meet her “forever family,” his daughter added.
Three dead, 11 injured in mass shooting at south Arkansas grocery

Tate Shrum, the son of Ellen Janie Shrum, said his mother was killed by a man she would have helped had he “just asked.”
Allysa Crutchfield, Ellen Janie Shrum’s granddaughter, said she would never get to experience the “bone-crushing hugs” of her “biggest cheerleader,” who would never get to watch her graduate from college. Posey, Crutchfield said, had scarred Fordyce with his act of violence.
“I want you to understand the profound ripple effect of your violence,” Crutchfield said.
Only one person said they had forgiven Posey — Jacqueline Curb.
“I had time to ask you not to shoot me, but you did,” she said.
But because of her faith and belief in second chances, Curb said, she forgave him.
Throughout it all, Posey did not speak, nor did he react. Most of the time he stared straight ahead or down at his lap, expressionless, only occasionally meeting the eyes of the people addressing him. He slouched in his seat until Browning-Grice demanded he sit up, which he did.
When asked by Judge Spencer Singleton of the 13th Circuit if he had anything to say once all the victims and their families had spoken, he shook his head and said, “No, sir.”

(Left photo via Asermely for RI; right photo via Stefano Famiglietti)Stefano Famiglietti and Alexander Asermely share a lot in common: age bracket (30s), hometown (North Providence) and profession (personal injury law).
And both think they are the best person to represent Rhode Island’s Senate District 4.
A special election Tuesday will decide which candidate will fill the seat left open after the death of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio in April. It marks the first time the 22,214 registered voters in the district spanning North Providence and a section of northern Providence will have a new state senator in 40 years; Ruggerio held the seat for 20 consecutive terms starting in 1984. 
Famiglietti, the Democratic candidate, pledged to follow in his predecessor’s footsteps, touting Ruggerio’s collaborative approach and devotion to his town.
“Like the Senate president, I have a long history of being very active in the community,” Famiglietti, 33, said in an interview on Monday. “I think that’s what voters really want to see.”


Polling information 
Polls open Tuesday at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.
North Providence will open three polling places for district voters: James L. McGuire Elementary School, Dr. Joseph Whelan Elementary School and Dr. Edward A. Ricci Middle School. Information about which voters are assigned to which polling place is available online. 
Eligible Providence voters will all vote at Veazie Street Elementary School.


Famiglietti has served on the North Providence Town Council since 2018, and started his own law practice in Providence earlier this year. He swept a four-way Democratic primary in July with 69% of the vote, finishing more than 50 percentage points ahead of the second highest vote-getter.
Famiglietti also tripled the size of his campaign war chest in the four months leading up to the special election, with $36,000 cash on hand as of July 28, including a $1,800 personal loan, according to reports filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections. 
He raised more than $60,000 in donations since April, primarily from individuals, including $2,000 from Ruggerio’s campaign account, controlled by Ruggerio’s brother-in-law who was also Ruggerio’s treasurer; $1,000 from Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian; and $500 from Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone. His $30,000 in campaign expenses since April includes $6,500 for the printing of yard signs and mailers and $5,600 to advertise in The Valley Breeze. 
His endorsements include the Rhode Island Senate District 4 Democratic Committee, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and Ciccone. And his campaign manager is Charles Ruggerio, son of Dominick Ruggerio.

Different in their online presence
While Famiglietti campaign yard signs blanket the district, he has not set up a campaign website. A self-described “old school” candidate, he explained that he thought face time with voters was more important than a website to win a special election.
“It’s about getting out there and introducing yourself, and reintroducing yourself,” Famiglietti said.
Republican Alexander Asermely, by contrast, has a multi-page campaign website with photos, news coverage and a sign up form for volunteers.
A first-time candidate backed by the Rhode Island GOP, Asermely, 39, works for Rubenstein Law out of its Boston office. He raised more than $10,000 since opening a campaign account on June 2, including $1,000 from the Rhode Island Republican Conservative Caucus and $750 from Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz. Asermely has spent nearly $8,000 on his inaugural campaign, with more than $6,800 shelled out in the last two-week period that ended July 28, according to campaign finance reports. 
He had $2,000 cash on hand, with a $2,700 unpaid personal loan, as of July 28.
Asermely did not respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Asermely’s website cites “crumbling infrastructure,” rising taxes and “eroding Constitutional rights” as problems he wants to address if elected. 
Famiglietti has also centered his campaign on local taxes, and wants to increase state aid to Providence and North Providence to relieve district residents from shouldering the burden of municipal revenue shortfalls. 
Describing himself as “pro-Second Amendment,” Famiglietti did not support an initial version of a state assault weapons ban considered by the Rhode Island General Assembly this year. He said he still needed to read through the amended version signed into law — which does not ban possession — before taking a position.
“As an attorney, I am always focused on personal rights,” he said.
Famiglietti, who is Catholic, also personally opposes abortion, but had no plans to challenge the state’s existing inclusion of abortion access in the constitution. He also signaled openness to revisiting the newly enacted smoking ban in Rhode Island’s two casinos, which as approved does not take effect until January 2027, and still allows smoking in designated areas. 
“I am always willing to listen,” Famiglietti said. “I may not change my mind, but I am open.”
Early voting in the special election continues through 4 p.m. Monday. 
More than 700 voters have already cast ballots by mail or in-person as of Monday afternoon, according to information from the Rhode Island Department of State and Board of Elections. 
The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026. 
State lawmakers are paid $20,391.97 a year.

Cigarettes. Vaping. Cigars. Chew. Today, there are more ways than ever to use tobacco. This means more possibilities leading to tobacco dependence—and related problems that can seriously impact a person’s health or potentially lead to death. With all these tobacco options, it may seem more difficult for a person to quit. However, while quitting may be challenging, options rooted in science can make it easier. In fact, if you’re ready to quit tobacco, reaching out to an evidence-based program like the Delaware Quitline can put the odds in your favor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smokers who get support are three times more likely to quit tobacco for good. Taking your first step requires just one phone call or “click.”
Public health advocates have been very instrumental in raising awareness of the dangers of tobacco use. Consequently, more people have the desire to end tobacco use. According to the CDC, in 2022, 67.7% of adult smokers wanted to quit, and 53.3% tried to quit within the prior year. Yet annually, less than one in 10 adults succeeds. The key to quitting for good comes down to engaging in a better way to do it. This is where the Delaware Quitline—whose work the American Lung Association strongly supports—excels, and it’s why the program has supported more than 4.3 million people in achieving their tobacco cessation goals.
The words “alone,” “cold turkey,” and “failure” are not in Delaware Quitline vocabulary. The Quitline philosophy believes in providing the support they know will work for Delawareans. Although the American Lung Association does not oversee the program directly, as a supporting partner of Delaware’s Tobacco Prevention and Control Program, we’ve experienced the ways Quitline support has grown and evolved over two decades of service to best meet the changing lifestyles, needs, and challenges of tobacco users. In addition, the program leverages new opportunities like online coaching.

(Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.
Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.

“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”

The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Having a loved one in prison or jail is estimated to cost families across the United States nearly $350 billion each year, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)U.S. families lose nearly $350 billion each year due to the incarceration of a loved one in jail or prison, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.
The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.
New York becomes latest state to offer free phone calls in prisons

The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.
Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

(Getty Images)A series of firms related to DuPont agreed to a more than $2 billion settlement with the state to resolve contamination involving so-called “forever chemicals” at four sites across New Jersey in what officials called the largest environmental settlement ever reached by a single American state.
The firms would pay $875 million under the proposed settlement, which the Department of Environmental Protection must approve in a rulemaking process that begins in September, and would be required to put another $1.2 billion into a fund to clean up environmental damages related to four New Jersey sites.
Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said companies that put “profit above public well-being” can be expected to be held responsible.
“When you turn on your water every morning in the state of New Jersey to make a coffee, to iron your shirt, to feed your dogs, you deserve for that water — unquestionably — to be safe and clean and reliably so,” LaTourette told reporters Monday “This funding source will help ensure that these synthetic chemicals, which have no place in our environment, are rooted out.”
DuPont declined to comment on the deal.
The settlement covers contamination stemming from firefighting foam containing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, called PFAS. Those substances take hundreds of years to decompose and have found their way into the blood of nearly all Americans.
PFAS substances can cause cancer, autoimmune disorders, and liver and kidney damage. They can spur developmental delays and behavioral issues in children.
If the settlement is affirmed, the payments would be made over 25 years. Of the $855 million in damages, about $125 million would go toward costs, fees, penalties, and punitive damages, while $750 million would be held in a trust account for the remediation of PFAS and other types of contamination, including through water treatment, according to LaTourette.
The settlement would cover contamination at two PFAS sites — a DuPont chemical plant in Parlin, and Chambers Works, a manufacturing facility in Deepwater that spread contaminants into nearby wells.
It would also provide for the remediation of contamination caused at Pompton Lake Works, a shuttered munitions production plant in Pompton Lakes, and a facility that manufactured dynamite in Parlin.
The settlement would resolve claims against E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co.; the Chemours Company and The Chemours Company FC, LLC; DuPont Specialty Products USA, LLC; Corteva Inc.; and DuPont de Nemours, Inc.
The settlement calls for the firms to establish a $475 million reserve fund that could cover remediation expenses if one of the firms involved in the settlement goes bankrupt or otherwise shuts down.
The proposed settlement will be published in the New Jersey register with a 60-day public comment period in the first week of September, in line with a requirement that the public be given time to comment on proposed environmental justice settlements before the courts are asked to approve them, LaTourette said.
The settlement announced Monday follows a $450 million settlement with the conglomerate 3M in May that was, at the time, the largest PFAS settlement in state history. That agreement was printed in the New Jersey register on July 21 and is awaiting the close of its public comment period.

Laura Kelly tours the Axe Shedd during an April 25, 2024, visit to Emporia. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly joined 22 other states and Washington, D.C., in suing the Trump administration for terminating federal funding, which she said has led to cuts to state agriculture, health and safety programs “on a whim.”
The federal lawsuit, initially filed in June in Massachusetts, targets decisions from President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency that are rooted in a regulation allowing the administration to eliminate funding if it “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”
Kelly said in a news release that the decisions have made “no sense.”
“I joined this lawsuit on behalf of Kansas to ensure funds going towards critical programs our state depends on are not ripped away by the Trump administration — or any presidential administration — on a whim,” she said.
Kelly joined the lawsuit in an amended complaint filed July 31.
States are suing the Office of Management and Budget and a slate of other federal agencies that have relied on the regulation to eliminate billions in funding.
Those decisions have been devastating, the states said in the lawsuit, depriving states of resources used to equip law enforcement, conduct medical and scientific research, address food insecurity, secure clean drinking water and educate students.
“Federal agencies have done all of this without any advance notice, without any explanation to the state recipients and in direct contravention of the will of Congress,” the lawsuit said. “The state recipients’ sole offense has been that they used the grant funding precisely how they had promised in the grant applications — and as they were instructed by the agencies at the time of the grant award.”
The governor’s office said the Trump administration has used the regulation “to terminate millions of dollars used to purchase goods from Kansas farmers, to mitigate natural disasters and to enhance childhood education.”
The states and D.C. want a judgment from the court that agrees the regulation does not embolden the administration to terminate funding based on priorities created after funding has been awarded. If that isn’t possible, the parties want the court to vacate the administration’s decision to rely on the regulation as the reasoning for terminating billions in federal funding.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)A group of state attorneys general, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of mounting an unconstitutional pressure campaign against gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges actions taken by the Justice Department to investigate and halt gender-affirming care across the country.
The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict gender-affirming care at the federal level through threats of criminal and civil penalties, while skirting state laws that protect transgender patients’ health care.

 
This report was first published by The 19th. Maine Morning Star is a member of The 19th News Network.



As federal investigations and funding threats roll out, hospitals across the country are shutting down their gender-affirming care programs for minors — including in areas where access to this care is protected by state law. Clinics and medical programs have shuttered in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois and Washington, D.C., among others — despite state laws that protect the care’s legality. Multiple hospitals have attributed shuttering or pausing their gender-affirming care programs to President Donald Trump’s executive orders and federal administrative actions, including the Yale health system and Denver Health in Colorado.

The White House recently celebrated these closures as a direct result of Trump’s executive orders.
“The administration’s actions put providers in an impossible position: either comply with unlawful federal threats or violate state laws that require nondiscriminatory access to medical care,” New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office said in a statement.
James and other attorneys general suing the Trump administration argue that these actions are not based in law, since no federal statute prohibits gender-affirming care in the United States. Instead, these actions are an intimidation tactic to suppress the health care, the lawsuit alleges. Through the courts, they are attempting to halt the Justice Department’s actions.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the attorneys general of states where gender clinics have recently shuttered, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. They assert that gender-affirming care is legally protected in all of their states and that federal efforts to block that care violate states’ rights provided by the 10th Amendment.
Over the past few months, federal agencies have begun to follow through on Trump’s executive orders regarding gender-affirming care.
In early July, Chad Mizelle, chief of staff at the Justice Department, announced that the agency had launched at least 20 subpoenas into clinics involved in gender transition care, alongside subpoenas to drug manufacturers and investigations into hospitals providing the care. Doctors are being subpoenaed for patients’ private information, the New York Times reports. The agency is following the White House directive it received in January, via executive order, to broadly investigate gender-affirming care. In these directives, the Trump administration has incorrectly conflated the care with female genital mutilation.
The New York lawsuit challenges these actions, as well as FBI criminal investigations into three children’s hospitals that currently provide gender-affirming care or have done so in the past. Although the lawsuit is being brought against Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, it also references other actions taken by federal agencies targeting gender-affirming care — including an all-day event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission. That event, titled “the dangers of ‘gender-affirming care’ for minors,” is where the Justice Department first announced its subpoenas for confidential patient information.
Major medical groups including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The new president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which sets global standards for doctors and nurses providing health care to trans patients, has expressed concerns that banning gender-affirming care will simply drive the care underground and endanger patients.
Transgender people, as well as the families and parents of transgender youth, are feeling increasingly worried and scared as the Trump administration targets their identities and their health care. For years, states have banned gender-affirming care for minors in red states and through Republican-controlled legislatures; but now, with the crackdown taking place on a national level, trans people living in blue states and liberal cities face the same threat.

(Getty Images)Here’s yet another story about how the powerful have a leg up on common folks when it comes to tax policy pitched as some sort of panacea. Whether intended for the economically disadvantaged or a nascent industry, it always seems like the big dogs end up with larger pieces of the bone.     
Cheniere Energy, the largest liquified natural exporter in the U.S., wants to claim a nine-figure federal tax credit for the fuel used to power the vessels that ship the commodity around the world from its LNG terminals in Sabine Pass, Louisiana and Corpus Christi, Texas. The massive tankers power themselves with a byproduct of the LNG they transport, and it’s this source that Cheniere considers an “alternative” fuel that qualifies for a tax break
The company seeks a $140 million credit from the Internal Revenue Service, according to an Inside Climate News analysis of the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Those records show Cheniere reported a $3 billion profit last year. 
The $140 million is the diesel fuel-equivalent value of the “boiled-off” LNG Cheniere used from 2018-24, when the tax credit expired. Keep in mind LNG tankers must boil off this gas in order to safely hold the liquified version it stores at temperatures that are at least minus-175 degrees Fahrenheit. Rather than just venting that gas, the LNG export industry has adapted its tankers to run off of it.
The tax break Cheniere wants is from an alternative fuel incentive Congress and President George W. Bush created in 2005. It was intended to spur use of power sources other than gasoline and diesel, but there were no parameters set to make sure the encouraged options were environmentally friendly ones. That meant LNG, biofuels such as corn ethanol and even fuels derived from coal qualified for the perk. 
So Cheniere is simply following the letter of the law in its application for the incentive. Nothing to get too bent out of shape over, right?
Not so fast, environmentalists and government watchdogs say.
Those critics contend it would be fiscally foolish for Cheniere and other LNG exporters not to use the boiled-off gas to power their tankers. Why spend money on diesel when there’s a free fuel source available that you have to create anyway?
Their arguably more legitimate beef with Cheniere’s tax credit request is that they feel it stretches well past the original intent of the 2005 measure. As written, the incentive applied to fuel used “in a motor vehicle or motorboat.” 
That an LNG tanker, which can equal the size of a military aircraft carrier, would be considered a motorboat is preposterous, Cheniere’s detractors say. They point to federal shipping regulations that define a motorboat as no longer than 65 feet. The typical LNG tanker is nearly 1,000 feet long.
Cheniere and a leading oil and gas industry organization did not respond to multiple requests from Inside Climate News to comment on its report.   
As to whether LNG tankers benefited the environment when they use boiled-off gas, Inside Climate News dove deeper into the science and math. They compared the carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions of the boiled-off gas with hypothetical diesel-fueled journeys and found the greenhouse gas from the byproduct was 12.5% less – a difference not terribly notable to clean energy advocates. 
A bigger concern is if the Cheniere tax credit application with the IRS is a canary in the regulatory coal mine that not only survives but thrives, as the Trump administration tends to favor all things fossil fuel. 
Case in point, the president ended all subsidies for wind energy development through a July executive order, and last week rescinded approval for all wind farm proposals in federal waters.
It should be noted Cheniere employees and affiliated political action committees contributed more than $343,000 to the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Its largest individual recipient, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, received $21,000.
Cheniere reported $3 billion in profits last year. A $140 million tax break would equal 4.7% of that net income – an amount certainly eye-catching to company shareholders.   
If granted, good government and climate interests fear the Cheniere tax credit will be the first of many.     
“You can rest assured that if Cheniere gets approved, anyone else in the same situation will file refund claims,” William Henck, a former IRS tax attorney and agency whistleblower, told Inside Climate News. “I guarantee you that.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LNG-carrier-terminal-1024x577.png,,,2025-08-04 14:56:38.566591

Photo courtesy of Josh Cowen.Michigan 7th Congressional candidate Josh Cowen recently gained the endorsement of the Network for Public Education Action, a national advocacy group opposed to charter schools and voucher programs, which touted the candidate’s commitment to championing public schools and other key issues.
Cowen is a professor of education policy at Michigan State University and is one of several Democratic candidates seeking to unseat U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte). 
“Josh is a national leader in the fight against school vouchers and privatization. He has studied voucher programs and school choice policies for nearly two decades, and has testified, published, and spoken widely on their harmful effects,” the group said in a news release. “He was recently named the 2025 Friend of Education by the National Education Association – the organization’s highest honor – and previously served as a Senior Fellow at the Education Law Center. His new book, The Privateers, exposes how voucher schemes fuel the broader culture wars.”
A ‘religious separatist movement in American education’

The group said its endorsement was based on Cowen’s stances on using test scores to evaluate teachers and vouchers moving public funding to private schools, issues to which Cowen is opposed.
The Network for Public Education Action also noted that Cowen has emphasized that Michigan’s population decline is forcing tough economic choices, and public schools are feeling the strain. 
“As enrollment drops but fixed costs remain, many districts are left in crisis – especially in areas saturated with charter schools. Meanwhile, relentless attacks on public education and the teaching profession are eroding trust and threatening the educator pipeline,” the group said of Cowen. “While schools must always strive for improvement, Josh believes that’s impossible without stable, long-term funding.”
The group noted the Michigan Legislature’s failure to meet its July 1 budget deadline, leaving the school aid budget in limbo as districts prepare for students and the school year to begin in September. 
“With the school year fast approaching, districts remain uncertain about their funding,” the group said. “Josh calls this unacceptable and unsustainable.”
The race for the Democratic nomination includes former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam, Alexandra Prieditis, Elyon Badger and Muhammed Salman Rais.

Article Summary 

JB Pritzker signed 124 bills into law on Friday, a significant chunk of the 436 sent to him by lawmakers in the spring session.
The governor still has hundreds more bills to consider.
The measures signed Friday affect Chicago public employee pensions, carbon sequestration near underground drinking water, AI regulation and more.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

Gov. JB Pritzker on Friday signed into law 124 of the 436 bills sent to him by lawmakers in the spring legislative session.
The measures signed last week expand what must be covered by state-regulated insurance plans, require libraries to stock opioid antagonists, and add new training requirements for law enforcement officers, medical professionals and food handlers.
Two of the most closely followed measures aim to protect the drinking water of a wide swath of central Illinois and boost the pension benefits for first responders in Chicago.
Carbon sequestration ban 
After the state moved to regulate carbon sequestration last year, advocates called on lawmakers to codify protections for the Mahomet Aquifer — a measure which Pritzker signed last week.
The aquifer is the sole source of drinking water for more than a dozen counties in Central Illinois, including communities in and around Peoria and Champaign.
Supporters of carbon sequestration technology, which sees carbon dioxide pollution buried deep underground, say that the process wouldn’t affect any drinking water because the carbon dioxide is hundreds or thousands of feet below where water sits.
But environmental advocates pointed to leaks last year at ADM, a major agriculture business that operates one of the few active carbon sequestration wells in the country in Decatur.

“While mitigating the effects of climate change should be a priority, it cannot be at the expense of the clean drinking water of nearly one million Illinoisans,” Sen. Paul Faraci, D-Champaign, said in a statement last week.
The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and with bipartisan support in the House.
Chicago police and firefighter pensions
Despite pressure from government watchdog groups to veto the bill, Pritzker signed House Bill 3657, which will provide Chicago first responders under the Tier 2 pension system with better benefits. Its supporters argued the bill was needed to bring Chicago first responders in line with their colleagues in other departments around the state.
The bill cleared the General Assembly with just one Republican senator opposing it, despite Chicago Chief Financial Officer Jill Jaworski warning a Senate committee it could increase the city’s unfunded pension liability by $11 billion, adding millions more in annual costs and decreasing the system’s funding ratio. The city is already facing a roughly $1 billion deficit in 2026.
“The city outlined the benefits and challenges related to Tier II pensions during the spring session, pointing out repeatedly that this was an unfunded mandate in what will already be a challenging budget cycle,” Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office said in a statement. “In recognition that this particular amendment passed with a veto-proof majority, we will continue to work with the Illinois General Assembly, and our City Council members to find long term solutions that stabilize the City’s pension funds with dedicated, progressive revenue so that Chicago’s workers can know that their retirements are secured.”
A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement that the governor expects Chicago to “implement these changes with careful planning and fiscal discipline.”
Other bills  
AI use in therapy: House Bill 1806 regulates the use of artificial intelligence in mental health therapy sessions. It specifically prohibits therapists from using AI to make independent therapeutic decisions, directly interact with patients, or detect emotions or mental states. AI use would be allowed for other specified support services. The unanimously passed law took effect upon the governor’s signature.
Paid time for nursing mothers: Senate Bill 212 requires employers to compensate mothers who take breaks at work to pump breast milk for up to a year after their child is born. The bill prohibits employers from requiring employees to use paid leave time for pumping. It takes effect in January.
Naloxone in libraries: House Bill 1910 requires that libraries maintain a supply of opioid overdose medication, like naloxone. This drug is often administered through a nasal spray like Narcan. The law also requires that at least one staff member be trained to identify overdoses and administer the drug.
Pandemic preparedness commission: Senate Bill 291 establishes the One Health Commission to aid in communication and collaboration between the doctors, veterinarians, and others on public health and safety when it comes to diseases that originate or mutate in animals. The commission is required to submit a report to the General Assembly by Jan. 1, 2028.
Police training on sexual assault: Senate Bill 1195, also known as Anna’s Law, requires police officers in training to participate in trauma-informed programs, procedures and practices that are designed to reduce trauma for victims. The bill is named after Anna Williams, a suburban resident who brought the initiative to lawmakers following her own experience with a sexual assault investigation. The bill takes effect in January.
Implicit bias training: House Bill 2517 requires health care providers to receive one hour of training on historic racial discrepancies in maternal care prior to renewing a state license, starting in July 2026. Health care professionals would take the course as part of required implicit bias training and be allowed to count completion of the course toward minimum continuing education requirements.
Gluten training: People required to receive food handling certification will now also have to learn about celiac disease, or gluten intolerance. Senate Bill 1288 added celiac disease education to 13 existing requirements for food handling. The training would teach about its symptoms and ways to avoid cross contamination.
Underground Railroad commission: Senate Bill 1607 establishes a Freedom Trails Commission to identify, preserve and promote historic sites in Illinois linked to the Underground Railroad. The commission would also work with the National Park Service’s Network to Freedom program to serve as a liaison between the Park Service and local entities involved in the history of the Underground Railroad.
Predatory towing: Senate Bill 2040 gives the Illinois Commerce Commission new powers to punish predatory towing companies which sometimes tow cars under false pretenses only to charge drivers afterwards. The ICC-backed law allows the agency to revoke towing licenses, impound tow trucks and more.
Lift-assist fees: House Bill 2336 allows municipalities or fire districts to charge assisted living facilities or nursing homes for calls to fire departments requesting help lifting a resident when it is not an emergency. The bill was an initiative of the Illinois Municipal League, which argued the calls to fire departments for the non-emergency service are a burden on local governments and shift liabilities for injuries that happen during the process to fire departments rather than the facility. The fees start being implemented in January.
Insurance coverage for anesthesia: House Bill 1141 requires insurance companies to cover the cost of anesthesia for the entirety of a procedure, rather than limiting the amount insurance will cover to a certain period of time. Rep. Bill Hauter, R-Morton, who is a physician in Peoria, told lawmakers during debate in April that patients can’t control how long their procedures last and surgeons often encounter unexpected challenges during procedures.
Therapeutic horse riding: Beginning in January 2026, state-regulated insurance plans will be required to cover therapeutic horseback riding. Hippotherapy is a type of physical, occupational and speech therapy where the movement of a horse is used to treat conditions such as autism, cerebral palsy, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, strokes, head and spinal cord injuries, as well as behavioral disorders and psychiatric disorders, including PTSD.
School bus seat belts: Beginning in July 2031, any newly purchased school bus in Illinois would be required to be equipped with seat belts that go over the lap and shoulders of all passengers. It does not mandate schools or bus drivers to ensure seat belts are properly fastened.

One need merely talk to friends and family members – even those with middle class incomes – to understand that the picture is bleak when it comes to finding affordable rental housing, much less homeownership opportunities.
That said, the numbers are bleak. The National Low Income Housing Coalition recently released a report entitled “Out of Reach: The High Cost of Housing” and it demonstrates how the wages that millions of hourly workers are earning don’t come close to what’s necessary. In North Carolina, a full-time worker must earn a minimum of $27.14 per hour to afford a modest, two-bedroom apartment.
So, how did we get here, how are policies in Washington deepening the crisis and what should we be doing? Recently, Newsline got a chance to explore these questions and more in an extended conversation with the executive director of the North Carolina Housing Coalition, Samuel Gunter.

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, says the National Transportation Safety Board hearings on the January midair crash in Washington, D.C., of a commercial jet out of Wichita and a military helicopter based in Virginia revealed failure to address known safety challenges. The accident killed 67 people, including Kansans. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran castigated the Federal Aviation Administration for failing to respond to warning signs and improve safety of airspace in the Washington, D.C., area before American Airlines flight 5342 and an Army Blackhawk helicopter collided in January.
Moran, a Kansas Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, Space and Innovation, said three days of National Transportation Safety Board hearings indicated unresolved staffing issues and a record of near misses were contributing factors in the Jan. 29 accident.
“Despite numerous warning signs of serious problems over the last several years, little was done to try and correct them, and these failures by the FAA, the Army and air traffic control cost 67 lives,” Moran said.
The airliner departed Wichita and fell into the Potomac River after slamming into the helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, known as DCA.
“I know the last few days have been painful for the families of the victims, and I assure them that Congress will not let these failures go unanswered. We cannot undo the tragic loss of life, but we can work to make certain it never happens again,” the senator said.
During the hearings, federal investigators said air traffic controllers responsible for the busy airport were pressured to “make it work.” Former DCA tower operations manager Clark Allen said the system was “pushing the line” on safety.
FAA administrators said the national shortage of traffic controllers had to be considered. On the night of the midair collision, one DCA tower controller was handling both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter traffic. Typically, two controllers divided that workload.
“The NTSB uncovered long-term staffing issues at the control tower that were compounded by a culture of distrust among DCA air traffic controllers and a toleration for unacceptable risks,” Moran said. “It is alarming that FAA failed to act on years of data and near misses indicating serious problems with the design of the mixed airspace around DCA.”
Before the accident, FAA staff said a concern had been raised about Army helicopters taking a route in proximity to commercial jet landings at the airport.
The Army helicopter involved in the collision flew above its ceiling of 200 feet, possibly due to an imprecise altimeter. The impact occurred at 278 feet and killed the three-person helicopter crew as well as 60 passengers, two pilots and two flight attendants on the American Airlines jet.

Crisler had asked Tonarri Moore, who donated to past campaigns, for a financial contribution for the sheriff’s race. Moore said he would donate if Crisler helped with several requests. Without the previous relationship, Crisler would not have acted, his attorney argues, and Crisler had no reason to believe he was being bribed. 
“The government, having concocted a bribery scheme to entrap Crisler, then had to contrive a corresponding quid pro quo to support the scenario with which to entrap him,” attorney John Holliman wrote in an Aug. 2 appellant brief. 
Crisler is asking the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse his conviction and render its own rulings on both counts. 
He was convicted in federal court in November after a three-day trial and sentenced earlier this year to 2 ½ years in prison. Crisler is serving time in FCI Beckley in West Virginia. 
The day before Crisler reached out to Moore to ask for support for his campaign for sheriff, Drug and Enforcement Administration agents raided Moore’s home and found guns and drugs. An FBI agent called to the scene looked through Moore’s phone and saw Crisler had called. 
The agent asked Moore what Crisler would do if offered money, and if Moore was bribing him. Moore said he wasn’t bribing Crisler, and the agent asked if Moore would do it. 
At that time, there weren’t reasonable grounds to start a bribery investigation into Crisler, his attorney argues, nor was there reason to believe he was seeking a bribe. 
Moore agreed to become an informant for the FBI, in exchange for the government not prosecuting him for the guns and drugs. 
The FBI fitted him with a wire to record Crisler during meetings, which began that day. The meetings included one inside Moore’s night club and a cigarette lounge in Jackson. Agents provided Moore with the $9,500 he gave to Crisler between September and November 2021.
Crisler’s 2023 indictment came as he campaigned again for sheriff and months before the primary election. He remained in the race and lost to the incumbent who he faced in 2021. 
At trial, the government argued the exchange of money were attempts to bribe because Moore made several requests of Crisler: to move his cousin to a different part of the Hinds County Detention Center, to get him a job in the sheriff’s office and for Crisler to let Moore know if law enforcement was looking into his activities. 
In closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Kirkham pointed to examples of quid pro quo in recordings, including one where Moore said to Crisler, “You scratch my back, I scratch yours” and Crisler replied “Hello!” in a tone that the government saw as agreement. 
The appellant’s brief argues that without Moore’s requests, the government lacked a way to show quid pro quo, a requirement of bribery charge: that Crisler committed or agreed to commit an official act in exchange for funds. 
Moore also asked Crisler to give him bullets despite being a convicted felon, which is prohibited under federal law. The brief notes how the government directed Moore to come up with a story for needing the bullets and to ask Crisler to give them to him.
In response, Crisler told Moore he could buy bullets at several sporting goods stores. Moore said they ran out, and eventually Crisler gave him bullets. 
Crisler also argues that the government prosecuted routine political behavior. Specifically, accepting campaign donations is not illegal, and can not constitute bribery unless there is an explicit promise to perform or not perform an official act in exchange for money. 
“Our political system relies on interactions between citizens and politicians with requests being made for this or that which is within the power of the elected official to do,” the brief states. “This does not constitute a bribery scheme. It is the normal working of our political system.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190437/Marshand-Crisler-1.jpg,,,2025-08-04 14:56:38.566591

The International Peace Garden, which straddles North Dakota and Manitoba, was founded in 1932 as a symbol of friendship between the two nations. 
The garden’s CEO, Tim Chapman, said the handshake was organized to show that commitment to peace and cooperation is still alive, despite recent stressors on the relationship between the United States and Canada, like the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
“It’s something we want to do every year,” Chapman said.

He said the garden is hoping for as many as 1,000 Americans and 1,000 Canadians to participate in the handshake, which is scheduled for 11 a.m. Students from Bottineau High School will sing both countries’ national anthems beforehand, Chapman said.
The event is part of the garden’s annual floral celebration. The full schedule for the day includes tours, a car show, scavenger hunts and other activities.
Vendors will also be there selling goods like flowers, art, homemade products and more. For more information, visit the garden’s website. The International Peace Garden is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The garden includes roughly 1,450 acres of Canadian land and about 900 acres of American land, with over 200 structures. Last year, it opened an expanded greenhouse featuring a collection of thousands of cacti and succulents.
Anyone interested in participating in the handshake is encouraged to get to the garden a bit before 11 a.m. since traffic is expected, said Chapman.

(DOJ photo)The names of four people killed in a bar shooting in Anaconda were released on Sunday by the Montana Department of Justice, as the suspect, Michael Brown, remains at large.
The state identified the four victims who were killed in Friday morning’s shootings as 59-year-old Daniel Edwin Baillie, 64-year-old Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 70-year-old David Allen Leach, and 74-year-old Tony Wayne Palm. All four were Anaconda residents.
At around 10:30 a.m., Aug. 1, Brown walked into the Owl Bar at 819 E. 3rd St., in Anaconda and began firing, a DOJ press release stated. In a Sunday press conference, Attorney General Austin Knudsen said the investigation is ongoing. He said the suspect had access to firearms, used a rifle in the shooting and lived next door to the bar.
Kelley was an employee at the bar, he said. The other three victims were patrons at the bar at the time of the shooting.
“I think that it’s likely that he knew the bartender and these patrons, which makes this even more heinous,” Kundsen said.
Knudsen added other details, saying the last law enforcement contact with Brown was around noon on Friday and that “some federal assets” were involved in that pursuit. Knudsen said the suspect “got rid of some personal belongings” and stole a vehicle, which he added had camping gear in it.
Investigators are acting under the assumption the suspect remains alive, Knudsen said. Local, state and federal resources have been used in the search and investigation.
“This, by all indications, is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever,” Knudsen said. “So there absolutely is concern for the public. Again, I’m going to stress we believe this is an armed and extremely dangerous individual. I’m going to ask the public to be vigilant.”
According to the Montana Standard, the suspect was a U.S. military veteran, serving in the Army from 2001 to 2005. He was then in the National Guard from 2006 to 2009, reaching sergeant in the force, the newspaper reported.
In a release, the DOJ said to call 1-877-926-8332 to report a tip.

The Lac du FlambeauTribal Police has received new information about a tribal member missing since March 17, Melissa Beson, 37.
The new information has redirected searches on the reservation in Vilas County and raised a new theory that she may have been picked up while walking along a county road.
Initially, Beson was last reported on Indian Village Road in Lac du Flambeau on the afternoon of March 17. Subsequently, thousands of acres of the forested reservation in the vicinity were searched.
New information received by the police reveals that after Beson had been seen on Indian Village Road, she received a ride from three local individuals in a van that ended up at a Kiboniki Lake boat landing on Highway D, where Beson exited the vehicle and walked toward the south.
Police report that a male in the van said he was concerned for Beson’s safety because of the remoteness of the area, and he followed her and encouraged her to return to the van.
When a northbound vehicle stopped near Beson, the man said he ran into the woods because he had an outstanding warrant, and he believed the vehicle was law enforcement.
Police have identified the driver of the northbound vehicle, who reported that Beson appeared to be “highly agitated,” and refused a ride. She continued walking south  as the driver continued northbound.
After this new information was reported, search efforts were conducted in an area near Highway D, south of the Kiboniki Lake boat landing, according to the tribal police department. Searches have been conducted on foot and using drones and dogs with no success in finding Beson.
Police Chief TJ Bill said his office is also considering the possibility that Beson may have been picked up by another driver on Highway D.
Previously, police investigated reports that Beson may have been staying with friends in the Wausau area, but those reports have never been confirmed.
Beson’s mother, Winifred Ann Beson, “Winnie,” has expressed concerns that human traffickers may have taken her daughter.
Beson is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos, including on her neck, arms and legs.
The Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Governing Board has authorized a $25,000 reward for credible tips leading to the recovery of Beson, to charges against  those who might be responsible for her disappearance, or both. 
Anyone with any information regarding the disappearance of Beson is asked to call either the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717 or the Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.

State Rep. Mike Drago, a Raymond Republican, said the change is about ensuring parents have control over what is appropriate for their children to be reading. The bill comes as many Republicans continue to argue that libraries are allowing inappropriate materials on shelves.

Before the November 2024 election, the Alabama secretary of state initiated a purge of thousands of registered voters but was blocked by a federal judge. (Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right. 


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.

“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”

The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-04 17:48:32+00:00,Mississippi Today,A monkey sanctuary in south Mississippi helps veterans with PTSD find peace,"Sophie Bates, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/04/monkey-sanctuary-helps-veteran-with-ptsd/,An Army veteran with PTSD says he has found peace through a bond with a spider monkey at the Gulf Coast Primate Sanctuary in Mississippi.,"PERKINSTON — In the embrace of a cheerfully chittering spider monkey named Louie, an Army veteran who grappled for decades with post-traumatic stress disorder says he finally feels at peace.
“Being out here has brought a lot of faith back to me,” said John Richard. “There’s no feeling like it.”
The bond began last fall when Richard was helping two married veterans set up the Gulf Coast Primate Sanctuary, volunteering his time to build the enclosure that’s now Louie’s home in rural southeastern Mississippi.
During a recent visit, Louie quickly scampered up Richard’s body, wrapping his arms and tail around him in a sort of hug. Richard, in turn, placed his hand on the primate’s back and whispered sweetly until Louie disentangled himself and swung away.
“He’s making his little sounds in my ear, and you know, he’s always telling you, ‘Oh, I love you,'” Richard said. “‘I know you’re OK. I know you’re not going to hurt me.'”
Richard said his connection with Louie helped more than any other PTSD treatment he received since being diagnosed more than 20 years ago.
It’s a similar story for the sanctuary’s founder, April Stewart, an Air Force veteran who said she developed PTSD as a result of military sexual trauma.
“It was destroying my life. It was like a cancer,” she said. “It was a trauma that was never properly healed.”

Stewart’s love of animals was a way to cope. She didn’t necessarily set out to create a place of healing for veterans with PTSD, but that’s what the sanctuary has become for some volunteers.
“By helping the primates learning to trust, we’re also reteaching ourselves how to trust, and we’re giving ourselves grace with people,” she said.
Her 15-acre property, nestled amid woods and farmland, is filled with rescue dogs, two rather noisy geese and a black cat. It’s also now home to three spider monkeys, two squirrel monkeys and two kinkajous, a tropical mammal that is closely related to raccoons.
The sanctuary in Perkinston, about 30 miles north of the Gulf Coast, includes three large enclosures for the different species. Each has a smaller, air-conditioned area and a large fenced-in outdoor zone, where the primates swing from platforms and lounge in the sun. Checking on the animals — changing their blankets, bringing food and water — is one of the first and last things Stewart does each day.
However, she can’t do it alone. She relies on a group of volunteers for help, including several other veterans, and hopes to open the sanctuary to the public next summer for guided educational tours.

Stewart and her husband, also a veteran, decided to open the sanctuary in October after first rescuing and rehoming monkeys. With the help of two exotic-animal veterinarians, they formed a foundation that governs the sanctuary — which she said is the only primate sanctuary in Mississippi licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — and ensures the animals will be cared for even when the Stewarts are no longer able to run it themselves.
All the animals were once somebody’s pet, but their owners eventually couldn’t take care of them. Stewart stressed that primates do not make good or easy pets. They need lots of space and socialization, which is often difficult for families to provide.
The sanctuary’s goal is to provide as natural a habitat as possible for the animals, Stewart said, and bring them together with their own species.
“This is their family,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/04122510/AP25213726446381.jpg,,,2025-08-04 13:56:43.819970

En Santa Rosa, una madre de seis hijos dice que tiene dificultades para pagar el alquiler tras la deportación de su marido, pero teme ser desalojada si solicita a su propietario mudarse a un lugar más pequeño.
 En Los Ángeles, una familia latina demandó a su propietario y a un agente inmobiliario por desalojo ilegal, sólo para que un abogado sugiriera que probablemente serían detenidos por agentes de inmigración antes de que el caso pudiera ir a juicio.
 En Oakland, un propietario que buscaba expulsar a los inquilinos les preguntó si eran “legales”.
En todo el estado, el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE) ha detenido a numerosas personas, dejándolos con dificultades para pagar el alquiler mientras que sus familiares lloran la ausencia de sus seres queridos. Pero el impacto de estas operaciones va más allá: el simple miedo a la deportación ha disuadido a muchos inmigrantes de ejercer sus derechos como inquilinos.
 Ya es bastante difícil ser inquilino en California, donde los alquileres se encuentran entre los más altos del país. Los inmigrantes que viven sin permiso de residencia suelen carecer de un historial crediticio confiable y trabajan en empleos mal pagados con prestaciones precarias . Ya les resulta más difícil conseguir una vivienda, pagan más por la que consiguen, tienen más probabilidades de vivir en condiciones de hacinamiento y podrían ser más propensos a ser desalojados.
La intensificación de la represión migratoria del presidente Donald Trump deja a los inquilinos más vulnerables al desalojo y la explotación, lo que podría sumir a más inmigrantes en la falta de vivienda, o incluso llevar a algunos a abandonar el país “voluntariamente”, dicen abogados y académicos especializados en derechos de vivienda.
 El temor a represalias por parte de los propietarios ha creado lo que los defensores describen como un efecto paralizante en los inquilinos inmigrantes, lo que “socava sustancialmente” las fuertes leyes de protección de los inquilinos de California, dijo David Hall, abogado codirector de derechos de los inquilinos del Centro Legal de La Raza, un grupo de asistencia legal sin fines de lucro en Oakland.
 “Puedes tener las leyes más protectoras del mundo, pero si la gente tiene miedo de aplicarlas… es como si para esa gente esas leyes no existieran”, dijo. 
 Los inmigrantes ya enfrentan mayores barreras de vivienda
 Encontrar una casa. Pagar el alquiler. Evitar el desalojo. Cada etapa del proceso de navegación en el mercado inmobiliario de California ya es más difícil para los inquilinos inmigrantes que viven en California en comparación con sus contrapartes nacidas en Estados Unidos.
 Los inquilinos inmigrantes indocumentados tienen acceso a muchas menos prestaciones públicas que los ciudadanos estadounidenses. Incluso cuando existen prestaciones o servicios, la tasa de aceptación es menor entre quienes viven sin documentos en el país, debido a la falta de conocimiento y al miedo a acceder a esos recursos, afirmó Thai V. Le, investigadora del Instituto de Investigación de Equidad de la USC.
 Por lo tanto, estos inmigrantes tienen mayor probabilidad de estar agobiados por el alquiler, lo que los expertos definen como pagar más del 30% de los ingresos del hogar en alquiler. En 2021, dos tercios de los inquilinos indocumentados en todo el estado estaban agobiados por el alquiler, en comparación con el 57% de todos los inquilinos inmigrantes y el 53% de sus pares nacidos en Estados Unidos, según el Portal de Datos de Inmigrantes de California del Instituto de Investigación de Equidad de la USC.
 Una vez que encuentran un lugar para alquilar, los inquilinos sin estatus migratorio legal tienen menos probabilidades de ejercer sus derechos como inquilinos y más probabilidades que otros de hacinarse en viviendas arrendadas por amigos o familiares. Estos acuerdos a menudo los exponen a condiciones de vida precarias, los privan de protección legal porque su nombre no figura en el contrato de arrendamiento y los exponen a un mayor riesgo de quedarse sin hogar si incluso uno de sus compañeros de vivienda pierde ingresos, afirmó Melissa Chinchilla, investigadora del Instituto de Política Latina de UCLA.
 El setenta por ciento de los latinos nacidos en el extranjero en California que están sin hogar vivían en viviendas de las cuales no tenían contrato de alquiler, en comparación con el 46% de los latinos nacidos en Estados Unidos, según un estudio realizado en junio de 2025 por la Universidad de California en San Francisco.
 Y una vez que un inmigrante indocumentado se queda sin hogar, es más difícil para él recuperar una vivienda, dijo Chinchilla.
 “Quizás no puedan proporcionar una verificación de crédito”, dijo. “Quizás les paguen en efectivo. Por lo tanto, es posible que no tengan ese historial de ingresos”. 
 ‘¿Quieren crear olas?’
 Todos esos temores y barreras se han intensificado ahora que Trump ha regresado a la Casa Blanca con más fuerza y enfoque en la aplicación agresiva e indiscriminada de leyes migratorias.
 Bajo su administración, el Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos de EE. UU. , el Servicio de Impuestos Internos (IRS) y el Departamento de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano de EE. UU. acordaron compartir los datos personales de los residentes con el ICE, que pronto recibirá una financiación sin precedentes . Los recortes propuestos al acceso de los inmigrantes a prestaciones públicas como la educación infantil, la atención médica y los programas de vivienda amenazan el sustento de las familias que dependen de dichos servicios.
 “Desafortunadamente, los peores temores de la gente se están confirmando”, dijo Cynthia Moreno, analista de datos senior del Equity Research Institute.

 La campaña de deportaciones ampliamente publicitada de la administración Trump “crea un entorno mucho más vulnerable para las personas que, en la relación propietario-inquilino, ya tienen una desventaja”, dijo Marie Claire Tran-Leung, abogada del Proyecto de Ley de Vivienda Nacional, un grupo de defensa de los derechos de los inquilinos.
 Las leyes de protección de inquilinos de California se encuentran entre las más estrictas del país. Incluyen un límite estatal al aumento anual del alquiler por parte de los arrendadores, límites en las tarifas de solicitud y los depósitos de seguridad, y términos y condiciones estrictos cuando un arrendador decide desalojar a un inquilino. En teoría, estos derechos se aplican a los inquilinos, independientemente de su estatus migratorio.
 Una ley estatal de 2018 prohíbe a los arrendadores preguntar o revelar el estatus migratorio de un inquilino a cualquier persona, incluidos los agentes federales de inmigración. También es ilegal que los proveedores de vivienda acosen o amenacen a los inquilinos por su estatus migratorio.
 Pero no todos los inquilinos conocen o están dispuestos a ejercer sus derechos.
 “Incluso si un inquilino tiene un muy buen propietario, si en el fondo siempre le preocupa que (el propietario) pueda ponerlo en el radar de ICE, un inquilino podría verse disuadido o inhibido de hacer valer estos derechos”, dijo Hall.
 En el Valle Central, la asistencia a talleres sobre los derechos de los inquilinos ha disminuido debido a que los inmigrantes temen ser blanco de ICE en eventos grandes, dijo Daniela Juárez, abogada de asistencia legal registrada en California Rural Legal Assistance.
 “Las organizaciones han dejado de promocionar sus talleres “Conoce tus Derechos” y, en cambio, dependen del boca a boca, por temor a ser blanco de ataques. Otras optan por realizar talleres solo con cita previa para no exponer a sus clientes”, escribió en un correo electrónico. “En general, todas han notado un efecto disuasorio en los servicios y les preocupa que la situación empeore”.
 Las familias también temen comparecer ante los tribunales por problemas de vivienda, ya que los agentes de inmigración suelen detener a personas en juzgados de todo el país. En marzo, la noticia de un arresto similar frente a la oficina de Libertad Condicional del Condado de Sonoma resonó entre la comunidad inmigrante de Santa Rosa, según Patrick McDonell, abogado especializado en vivienda de Asistencia Legal del Condado de Sonoma.
 “Tenemos muchos clientes que están básicamente dispuestos a aceptar un trato que no es el mejor que podríamos conseguirles con tal de no tener que estar presentes en un tribunal”, dijo McDonell.
 Esto ha sido así incluso en casos en los que él y sus colegas consideran que las acusaciones del propietario son “falsas o legalmente insuficientes”, dijo. “Sin embargo, esa persona tendrá que mudarse, simplemente porque sabemos que no tenemos un cliente al que podamos llevar a juicio”.
 El miedo no termina ahí: Solicitar una reparación. Presentar una queja informal. Asistir a talleres sobre el derecho a la vivienda. Buscar un alojamiento rutinario. Para los inmigrantes indocumentados, las familias con estatus migratorio mixto o cualquier persona que, de otro modo, pudiera preocuparse por llamar la atención de los agentes de inmigración, estas interacciones rutinarias se han vuelto más tensas.
 “La gente está teniendo que hacer una evaluación de riesgos”, dijo Juárez. “¿Quieren causar problemas? ¿Quiero molestar a mi casero?” 
 No existe una solución milagrosa para las dificultades financieras
 El temor a la deportación también está disuadiendo a los inmigrantes de ir a trabajar o recibir beneficios públicos, lo que según los expertos podría tener repercusiones económicas en todo el estado.
 Durante el primer gobierno de Trump, los inmigrantes se retiraron de los beneficios alimentarios federales por temor a ser blanco de las autoridades migratorias o a que se les dificultara obtener la ciudadanía. Chinchilla teme que la historia se repita. Trump ya está pidiendo a los estados que compartan información sobre los beneficiarios de los cupones de alimentos, lo que ha provocado una demanda de California y otros 18 estados gobernados por los demócratas.
 Este miedo ya existía. Me imagino cuánto más acentuado está ahora que sabemos que es una realidad que la información de las personas se comparte con el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) —dijo—.

Después de que ICE deportara a su esposo —quien ganaba la mayor parte de los ingresos de la familia como jardinero— de regreso a Honduras en abril, dijo, ha luchado por mantener a su familia con vivienda.
 Consideró pedirle al administrador de la propiedad que trasladara a la familia a un apartamento más pequeño. Eso significaría hacinar a los cinco miembros de la familia en un apartamento de una sola habitación, pero técnicamente sería asequible, dijo. Pero Karen, quien dijo que se quedó más tiempo del permitido por su visa hondureña, teme que la mera solicitud pueda provocar que su casero inicie un proceso de desalojo. Dijo que también se muestra reticente a buscar trabajo, dada su situación irregular. En cambio, dijo, la familia apenas sobrevive con los ingresos de su única hija en edad laboral y con dinero prestado de familiares mientras ella considera sus opciones.
 No hay ninguna norma legal obvia.
 Para los inquilinos como Karen que, como resultado de una deportación, simplemente no tienen los fondos para pagar el alquiler, las amplias protecciones para inquilinos de California no ofrecen una solución, incluso si estuviera dispuesta a ir a la corte, dijo McDonell de Sonoma County Legal Aid.
 “La realidad es que no existe una solución milagrosa para la falta de dinero para pagar el alquiler”, dijo.
 Algunos gobiernos locales, como el condado de Los Ángeles y las ciudades de Long Beach y Los Ángeles , están estableciendo programas financiados con donaciones para ayudar a los inmigrantes a pagar el alquiler y otros pagos. El estado también cuenta con varios programas de asistencia para inmigrantes , y los legisladores de California autorizaron un aumento de $25 millones a principios de este año para brindar servicios legales a inmigrantes a través de organizaciones sin fines de lucro.
 Pero esos dólares se gastan muy rápido y “siempre hay más necesidades que dólares en la cuenta”, dijo Hall.
 En la California rural, los recursos son escasos y están más dispersos y es difícil llegar a ellos sin un automóvil, dijo Juárez.
 “Hay desalojos por todas partes, pero hay menos ayuda para combatirlos en nuestras comunidades rurales y nos vendría bien toda la ayuda posible”, dijo.

The Office of State Ethics announced the settlement with Colangelo on Monday, more than three years after Colangelo retired from state service following an investigation into his relationship with Diamantis.
Colangelo, who is now serving as a lecturer at the University of New Haven, agreed to pay the civil fine but did not admit to violating the state’s ethics laws.
But state ethics officials determined that there was “probable cause” to believe Colangelo broke the state’s ethics codes by hiring Diamantis’ daughter as his executive assistant, while he was seeking pay raises for himself and others from the state’s Office of Policy and Management.
“This case reinforces the fundamental principle that state service must be free of quid pro quo arrangements,” Peter Lewandowski, the director of Office of State Ethics, said in a prepared statement. “Although the Respondent contested the Office of State Ethics’ position, the resolution reflects the seriousness of the allegations and our continued commitment to safeguarding the integrity of state government. Public trust must remain paramount.”
Colangelo did not immediately respond to an email about the settlement. Diamantis did not return a phone call seeking comment.
The allegations included in Colangelo’s settlement agreement echo the findings that were included in a nearly 40-page investigative report that was paid for by Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration in late 2021. 
Lamont, who was preparing to campaign for another term as governor in 2022, hired a former federal prosecutor at the Hartford law firm Day Pitney to look into the relationship between Colangelo and Diamantis after Kevin Rennie, a columnist with The Hartford Courant, wrote an article about Diamantis’ daughter being hired.
The job that Diamantis’ daughter was selected for in 2020 paid $99,000 per year. Diamantis, who worked as a deputy in the Office of Policy and Management at the time, had influence over the state’s budget and state employee pay.
Around the same time Lamont ordered the investigation into Colangelo and Diamantis, a federal grand jury had also subpoenaed the state seeking information about Diamantis, who managed the state’s multibillion-dollar school construction program.
Diamantis, who stepped down from state service in 2021, has since been charged in two separate federal criminal cases.
He was charged in May 2024 for allegedly extorting contractors on school construction projects and then accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from those companies. And he was charged earlier this year for allegedly accepting bribes in return for pressuring state officials to drop a Medicaid audit that was examining the billing practices of a politically connected eye doctor.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/072020_PoliceConference_RockyHill_07.jpg,,,2025-08-04 13:56:43.819970

Read it here.
El gobernador Gavin Newsom está considerando una elección especial en la primera semana de noviembre para pedir a los votantes de California que aprueben los distritos revisados de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos que podrían impulsar las perspectivas demócratas en las elecciones intermedias de 2026.
 Aunque todavía no se han propuesto nuevos escaños, Newsom dijo el jueves que está trabajando con la Legislatura y representantes del Congreso en un plan que dejaría de lado temporalmente la comisión de redistribución de distritos independiente de California y llevaría un mapa alternativo directamente al público para su aprobación.
 “Nos acercaremos a la gente de este estado de manera transparente y les pediremos que consideren las nuevas circunstancias, que consideren estas nuevas realidades”, dijo Newsom a los periodistas durante una visita a un aeródromo del condado de Sacramento, donde mostró el nuevo equipo estatal contra incendios.
 “Esto no se hará a escondidas. No lo harán miembros de ningún grupo u organismo privado”, añadió. “Se presentará a los votantes para su consideración de forma muy transparente, para que sepan exactamente qué están haciendo y puedan volver en 2030 a la forma original con nuestra redistribución de distritos independiente intacta”.
 Fue el mayor detalle que el gobernador ha proporcionado públicamente hasta el momento sobre cómo planea responder a la creciente guerra de redistribución de distritos partidista desatada por el presidente Donald Trump en los últimos meses.
 Los estados redistribuyeron por última vez sus escaños en el Congreso después del censo de 2020, para garantizar que los distritos fueran aproximadamente iguales en población, y no se esperaba que volvieran a realizar el proceso durante otra década.
 Pero los líderes republicanos están bajo creciente presión de Trump para ayudar a consolidar una estrecha mayoría republicana en el Congreso antes de unas elecciones intermedias potencialmente desafiantes. Los legisladores texanos se apresuran a adoptar un nuevo mapa del Congreso que elimina cinco escaños demócratas , lo que ha provocado esfuerzos similares en otros estados controlados por los republicanos y la preocupación de los demócratas sobre cómo contrarrestarlo. 
 Newsom: California debe intervenir
 Newsom afirmó nuevamente el jueves que California debe pausar la redistribución de distritos independiente, que anteriormente apoyó, para luchar contra un presidente que “quiere manipular el juego” contra los demócratas, quienes potencialmente podrían bloquear la agenda de Trump si ganan el control de la Cámara en 2026.
 “De hecho, la presidencia de Trump termina en noviembre del próximo año si se le da al pueblo estadounidense una oportunidad justa, una voz y una opción”, dijo Newsom.
 Mientras que la mayoría de los demás estados otorgan la autoridad de redistribución de distritos a sus legislaturas, California recurre a una comisión ciudadana bipartidista creada por los votantes mediante una iniciativa de ley. Por lo tanto, para usurpar la comisión e implementar más distritos con tendencia demócrata, Newsom debe convocar elecciones especiales estatales y volver a consultar con los votantes.
 Los demócratas actualmente controlan 43 de los 52 escaños de la Cámara de Representantes del estado, incluidos varios distritos competitivos que pasaron del control republicano en noviembre pasado.
 El gobernador afirmó que quiere celebrar las elecciones el primer martes de noviembre porque muchas comunidades ya tienen elecciones locales programadas para esa fecha. Esto podría facilitar su organización con poca antelación y ayudar a reducir un costo estimado de más de 200 millones de dólares, aunque Newsom también afirmó que “hay demasiado en juego” como para preocuparse por el costo.
 “¿Cuánto costó el espectáculo con la Guardia Nacional y Trump?”, preguntó, refiriéndose al reciente despliegue de miles de tropas por parte del presidente en Los Ángeles para sofocar las protestas relacionadas con la inmigración. “¿Cuántos cientos de millones de dólares se desperdiciaron?”
 La fecha límite de noviembre le da a California un plazo extremadamente ajustado para actuar. La ley estatal exige que las oficinas electorales de los condados envíen una papeleta de voto por correo a cada votante registrado un mes antes del día de las elecciones; las papeletas de voto para militares y residentes en el extranjero, así como las guías de información para votantes, se envían 15 días antes. El material tendría que estar listo a finales de septiembre para cumplir con esos plazos.
 Mientras tanto, la Legislatura está en receso de verano hasta el 18 de agosto. Se espera que las asambleas demócratas del Senado y la Asamblea estatales comiencen discusiones privadas la próxima semana sobre el avance de una medida electoral, que requiere una mayoría de dos tercios en ambas cámaras, para que potencialmente puedan aprobarla antes de fines de agosto.
 El presidente pro tempore del Senado, Mike McGuire, demócrata de Healdsburg, no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios. El presidente de la Asamblea, Robert Rivas, demócrata de Salinas, afirmó que la Asamblea revisará sus opciones para contrarrestar el plan de redistribución de distritos de Trump y “garantizar que nuestro gobierno siga siendo justo, transparente y representativo del pueblo”.
 “Esta medida es un intento de silenciar a los votantes que rechazan el extremismo MAGA, incluso aquí en California, donde el pueblo se ha expresado alto y claro en dos elecciones nacionales”, dijo Rivas en un comunicado.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/020623-US-Capitol-DC-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C691&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-04 13:56:43.819970

When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
After initial request, U.S. DOJ has not obtained Wisconsin voter data

New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Debris removal will pick up during a respite from the monsoon rains this week, officials said.(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Even though flooding has briefly let up, the Village of Ruidoso and surrounding areas continue to face significant impacts to daily life from floods late last week, including water and sewer outages; impassable roads; and the rescue of three people trapped in their cars.
Between July 30 and Aug. 1, the National Weather Service compiled 21 impact reports regarding flash floods and debris flows in Lincoln County. That included several overrun bridges, a car stuck in the mud and a flooded horse tunnel, in addition to the water rescues.
While the village’s Public Works Department “has been working around the clock to restore services after each flood event, we face the ongoing challenge of new flood events that can undo repair progress and create additional damage to our infrastructure,” officials posted on Facebook. 
Officials called on residents to conserve water and said they were prioritizing critical water systems as they continue to deal with repeated floods and debris flows that “are testing our infrastructure in ways we haven’t experienced before.”
Potable water is available at Wingfield Park from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., according to a village Facebook post Monday morning. Bottled water is also available at the parking lot of the Eastern New Mexico University-Ruidoso branch.
Forecasts predict a drier week and a welcome break from the monsoon rains causing continued flooding in the burn scars around Ruidoso.
“We’re looking forward to a few days to dry out, for sure,” Village of Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford told Source NM on Friday.
Conditions will be noticeably drier and hotter around the state until early next week, according to Randall Hergert, a forecaster at the Albuquerque office National Weather Service.
“The tap of moisture has been turned off, essentially,” Hergert said, adding that the pattern of afternoon rains is expected to return this weekend and early into next week.
Crawford said the focus will be on debris removal and trying to deepen the riverbeds of the Rio Ruidoso, as repeated floods have deposited as much as nine feet of silt in places.
“That makes the riverbed shallower, that means water is going wider, grabbing more structures, more homes, more businesses,” he said. “That’s why we work so hard to get that debris cleared out.”

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest, and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Max Misch, who made headlines several years ago for his racial harassment of a former Bennington representative, who is Black, has been arrested on several charges, including kidnapping and aggravated domestic assault. 
Misch, 42, is set to appear in court Monday afternoon for an arraignment on the charges. He was listed Monday morning as being held without bail at the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland.
Misch was arrested Friday night stemming from an incident on Pleasant Street in Bennington, according to Bennington Police Chief Paul Doucette. He referred additional questions about what led to the arrest to a police affidavit filed in support of the charge, which is expected to become public following Misch’s court arraignment.  
In addition to the kidnapping and aggravated domestic assault offenses, Misch also faces charges of unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment and interference with access to emergency services, Doucette said.
Misch has been arrested in the past on several charges, including aggravated domestic assault, a charge of disorderly conduct with a hate crime enhancement and repeated violations of his conditions of release. Later plea deals eventually led to probationary sentences allowing him to avoid jail.
Misch is currently set to be sentenced on Aug. 11 in Bennington County for two misdemeanor convictions related to the illegal possession of high-capacity firearm magazines. A jury convicted him of those two charges in April following a trial.
Each charge carries a potential maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $500 fine.
Misch was a central figure in the racial harassment that led Kiah Morris, a former House representative from Bennington, to not run for office again. Morris, who had been the only Black woman lawmaker in the Legislature, announced in summer 2018 she would not be running for reelection, citing, in part, the online attacks. 
Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan, who was in office at that time, investigated the Morris matter, but decided against filing criminal charges against Misch, who admitted to racially harassing Morris. Donovan cited the broad protections of the First Amendment in explaining his decision not to bring charges against Misch.

When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.

Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.

“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”

The 435-page report found average wait times exceeding 1 hour and 15 minutes, with more than 13% lasting longer than 2.5 hours. That leads to longer travel distances, with nearly half of DMV customers bypassing their local office for a farther one in search of quicker service.
In a press conference unveiling the report Monday morning, Boliek said the economic impact to the state of a deficient DMV — including lost work days and school days from North Carolinians seeking license — justifies immediate intervention.
“Fixing the DMV is going to take buy-in from all levels of government,” Boliek said. “We’ve seen, for example, the response that our legislature and our citizens have given to western North Carolina when we have a disaster. Folks, the DMV is at that level of emergency.”
  State Auditor Dave Boliek compared the economic cost of the state’s inefficient DMV to the damage brought by Hurricane Helene, and called for a similarly extensive response on Monday, August 4, 2025. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
The report attributed inefficiency at the DMV in part to “structural challenges” inherent to being a division of NCDOT. It finds that the DMV has limited say in statewide decision-making, lacks budgetary autonomy, fails to consistently track performance, and has been excluded from major modernization efforts aimed at improving its functions.
Arguing that “DOT needs the DMV, not the other way around,” Boliek said the DMV generates roughly $2.2 billion in revenue, about 30% of the NCDOT revenue, but receives only 3% of its expenditures. He also pointed out that NCDOT has met only 31% of the DMV’s staffing requests — despite an increase of about 3 million residents in 20 years, the state has only added 52 license examiner positions, with 160 vacancies at present.
DMV Commissioner Paul Tine, who took over the agency in May, and NCDOT Secretary Joey Hopkins both oppose the split. In a response appended to the report, they wrote that shifting resources to managing a split would delay more immediate remedies to long wait times and staffing shortages.
“Separating would require significant resources and would distract from efforts to improve customer experience and operations at DMV,” they wrote. “DMV faces budgetary constraints that could be more effectively solved with other mechanisms.”
Instead, they requested the legislature approve an assessment of a new percentage-of-fees based funding model, rather than the current biennial appropriations model. That would allow the agency to receive greater funding which it could put toward new hires and other process improvements, they said.
Beyond structure, Boliek found that the DMV suffers from chronic employee burnout, with 160 driver’s license examiners sitting vacant and 43% reporting negative views of support from previous leadership. Workers interviewed also complained about low pay and concerns over safety — including incidents where employees were followed out of the building and where a customer kicked in a glass pane out of frustration.
A potential solution to low pay, Boliek said at the press conference, is implementing market-based salaries to pay workers based on regional cost of living.
“Let’s just be honest about it, it costs more to live in Charlotte than it does in rural eastern North Carolina,” Boliek said. “We need to look at it from a pay standpoint of what we pay folks to get the job done.”

[…],"Hillsborough County Republican state Sen. Jay Collins speaking in Tampa on May 12, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Will Byron Donalds get a serious GOP challenger in his bid to become the next governor of Florida?
That question remains unresolved with more than a year before Republican primary voters will decide on their standard bearer to succeed Ron DeSantis and attempt to keep the governor’s mansion under conservative control for another four years.
A man whose name has been floated as possibly challenging Donalds for the nomination — Hillsborough County state Sen. Jay Collins — is not saying that he’ll be that candidate, but does argue that someone needs to take on the Naples-based U.S. representative next year.
“I think that there’s a lot of time in any election between now and then,” he told a small group of reporters Saturday during the Florida Freedom Forum, a Republican event, in Orlando. “And historically, you don’t ever have just one candidate in a primary. Whether I ever decide to step into the arena or somebody else does, I think there’s a high chance that somebody will step in.”
Collins told the Phoenix in May that if DeSantis were to appoint him to serve as lieutenant governor, it would be “an honor” and that he’d be happy to do it. Since then, rumors have spread that the governor’s choice for LG would be considered his hand-picked challenger to Donalds.
But that was nearly three months ago, and DeSantis still hasn’t decided publicly his choice to succeed Jeanette Nuñez, who departed the position to lead Florida International University in February.
Another name that has been floated in the interim is former House Speaker Paul Renner, who participated in a panel discussion held at the Forum Saturday on school choice.
And then of course there’s Casey DeSantis, whom the governor has been pumping up for the race — although she and the governor have been relatively low-key on that matter in recent weeks.
Collins, an ally of the governor who was granted a prime spot to speak to the attendees at the Forum on Saturday, says that at the end of the day it’s “about getting the best candidate forward” for the Republican Party of Florida.
“I think competition’s good for anybody,” he said. “And look, I don’t want anybody to say anything. I have no umbrage with Byron. I don’t. I believe we should have a choice. Byron is a conservative leader. His family have done great things in the community. And in the end, you know, what I think our government, our people, our world works better with choice, and will see where life goes, but in the end, we’re going to be okay. Florida’s in a great position.”
Donalds also appeared at the Forum on Saturday. He engaged in a 40-minute discussion with conservative influencer Benny Johnson, who asked how we would continue “Trump policies” in Florida?
Donalds responded by saying that he gave a lot of the credit to Gov. DeSantis for “where we are as a state.”
When asked about the only major Democrat to enter the gubernatorial race, former GOP U.S. Rep. David Jolly, Donalds was dismissive. “Bless his heart,” he said of his potential 2026 opponent. ‘Bless his heart. That’s all I’m going to say.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a bill into law Friday banning New Hampshire public schools, colleges, and universities from being used to shelter migrants.
House Bill 71 would revoke state funding from any public school, college, or university housing migrants that violate the law. That includes both migrants being housed while the government is attempting to resettle them and migrants who are en route to deportation. The law makes exceptions for short-term shelter during natural disasters, such as hurricanes or blizzards.
State Rep. Juliet Harvey-Bolia, a Tilton Republican who introduced the bill, said it was aimed at preventing school shutdowns. She cited a January 2024 incident in New York City as inspiration for the bill. There, during a severe storm, migrants living in a tent shelter were moved to a Brooklyn high school for roughly 12 hours, according to news reports from the city. Classes were held online for one day while the migrants were there.
Additionally, state Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican advocating for the bill, said in a committee meeting that he did a public records request for incident reports at Massachusetts facilities that housed migrants. He said those records showed fights, assaults, overdoses, rapes, and attempted suicides occuring.
The new law also includes a few unrelated provisions that were tacked onto the bill during the legislative process. It requires towns and cities in New Hampshire with 10,000 or more people to post any changes in property valuations publicly in a newspaper, online, and on social media. An earlier version of the bill required municipalities to personally notify residents, but lawmakers were concerned this would qualify as “an unfunded mandate,” because it would effectively require municipalities to buy stamps to notify residents via mail. The law also requires any contract that the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services enters into to abide by the patients’ bill of rights, a previously enacted law outlining what patients at state and private health care facilities are entitled to.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/statehouseprivacybill-1024x652.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 12:56:57.448051

The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.
The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.

The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.

Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

Nessel and 18 other attorneys general assert that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program over five fiscal years. It is among more than two dozen lawsuits filed by Nessel against the administration.
“The Trump Administration’s decision to unilaterally cut off these funds is not only unlawful – it jeopardizes Michigan’s EV infrastructure, while threatening our economic growth and environmental progress,” Nessel said in a statement issued Monday. “I will continue working to protect this critical funding and the future of transportation in our state.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The NEVI program was created to fund the nationwide deployment of EV charging stations to improve charging reliability and accessibility. Approximately $87 million was apportioned to Michigan for fiscal years 2022 through 2025.
But Trump on his first day in office mandated federal agencies to pause disbursement of all funding appropriated under the infrastructure act, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, including the EV infrastructure funding.
Those funds were mandated by Congress, but the administration has since unlawfully revoked previously-approved state highway plans and said it was no longer committed to funding those projects.
Nearly $29 million in congressionally-approved funding is currently unavailable.
The lawsuit was jointly filed by Nessel and the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as Kentucky Gov.

(Photo credit: Getty Images)The freeze of over $6 billion in federal funds for K-12 education caused interruptions to summer programming, state experts said, and more juggling of funding streams is likely to come.
At its meeting last week, state lawmakers on the New Mexico Legislature’s Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee received an update on federal education funds and possible upcoming impacts to schools, students and teachers due to the Trump administration’s recently passed “big, beautiful bill.” Legislative Education Study Committee Senior Fiscal Analyst Daniel Estupiñan explained to lawmakers that because of the programmatic review announced earlier this summer, schools received federal funds four weeks late and some are now hesitant to trust that federal funds will be available in the future.
The freeze affected programs that support migrant children, English learners and after-school programs. Estupiñan noted that the impacted student groups also fall under at-risk groups identified by the Yazzie/Martinez educational equity lawsuit.

“That four-week hold, along with the lack of guidance from the federal government about how to navigate that withholding, contributed to some pretty significant disruptions to summer programming and local budget planning for the next school year, to the point where we had summer programs around the state that could have had to shut down with only a few days’ notice,” Estupiñan said during the meeting. “[Districts are] rethinking whether these federal funding sources are as sustainable and reliable as they used to be.”
Estupiñan also said that because Trump signed the GOP’s reconciliation bill into law on July 4, school districts could be at risk of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for student services, school-based Medicaid services, school meals, the state’s public school funding formula and other programs. He explained that the bill reduces Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program enrollment, which informs how much federal money is given to the states for such programs. 
New Mexico Public Education Department Director of Strategic Services Kenneth Stowe highlighted to committee members several programs that had federal funding rescinded. These include school-based mental health centers in Silver City and several central New Mexico communities; the Education Innovation and Research Program; and several technical support centers. He added that the Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grant, State Personnel Development Grant and other programs are still at risk for losing federal funding support.
“I know that there are members of this committee that are former educators and should definitely know how certainty during the beginning of the year really affects the planning for the rest of the school year,” Stowe said. “Repeated funding delays…last minute requests to re-certify compliance in federal law, abrupt policy reversals — this has all been things that our districts and schools have had to respond to, that have affected their ability to effectively really focus on the kids, the classrooms, the teachers.”
He said uncertainty created by the federal government has led local districts to create budgets “to account for multiple scenarios.”
“It’s a lot of duplication of effort for our districts and schools,” Stowe said. “This means a loss of time and capacity [for kids], and we’re just reducing the quality of educational services.”
New Mexico is one of over 20 states that joined a lawsuit over the administration’s freeze of federal K-12 and adult education funds, and the interpretation of federal public benefits. 
Subcommittee Co-Chair Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces) proposed that the Legislature consider overfunding “department secretaries so they’ve got available carryover to use when needed,” like in cases of federal uncertainty, “which is much more nimble than a legislative body that puts it into a specific budget line.”

In addition to receiving notifications, users can text specific keywords for updates:

Text “out” to report an outage
Text “status” to receive an update on service restoration

Those who do not receive automated messages can join the system by texting “opt” to 302-366-7000.
The new Customer Outage Portal, accessible at here, will allow users to view outage maps, report outages, and check estimated restoration times.
Additionally, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system will manage incoming calls when customer service is unavailable, such as after hours.
The IVR will allow customers to report problems and request a callback once power has been restored.
According to city officials, no action is required for most customers to begin using the new system.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.
Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
 Undermining ERIC

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
 ‘A total shock’

In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

More than 3.5 million acres had been designated wind energy areas, the offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy development. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is now rescinding all designated wind energy areas in federal waters, announcing on Wednesday an end to setting aside large areas for “speculative wind development.”
Offshore wind lease sales were anticipated off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Maine, New York, California and Oregon, as well as in the central Atlantic. The Biden administration last year had announced a five-year schedule to lease federal offshore tracts for wind energy production.
Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies after taking office in January. A series of executive orders took aim at increasing oil, gas and coal production.
The Republican president has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind. One early executive order temporarily halted offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and paused the issuance of approvals, permits and loans for all wind projects. In trying to make a case against wind energy, he has relied on false and misleading claims about the use of wind power in the U.S. and around the world.
The bureau said it was acting in accordance with Trump’s action and an order by his interior secretary this week to end any preferential treatment toward wind and solar facilities, which were described as unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources.
Renewable energies such as wind and solar provide an intermittent supply of electricity when it is windy or sunny. Increasingly, batteries are getting paired with solar and wind projects to allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when sources such as wind and solar are not producing.
European companies are developing offshore wind farms along America’s East Coast.
The Interior Department is considering withdrawing areas on federal lands with high potential for onshore wind power to balance energy development with other uses such as recreation and grazing. It also will review bird deaths associated with wind turbines, which are allowed under federal permits that consider the deaths “incidental” to energy production.
Earlier this month, the department said all solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, applauded the administration for its actions and said they were long overdue. Opponents of offshore wind projects are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey.
“It’s hard to believe these projects ever got this far because of the immensity, scale, scope and expense, compared to relatively cheap and reliable forms of onshore power,” he said Thursday. “We’re nearly there, but we haven’t reached the finish line yet.”
The Sierra Club said the administration’s “relentless obstruction of wind energy” shows it does not care about creating affordable, reliable energy for everyday Americans.
“No matter how much they want to bolster their buddies in the dirty fossil fuel industry, we will continue to push for the cleaner, healthier, and greener future we deserve,” Xavier Boatright, Sierra Club’s deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification, said in a statement.
Attorneys general from 17 states, including Connecticut, and the District of Columbia are suing in federal court to challenge Trump’s executive order halting leasing and permitting for wind energy projects. His administration had also halted work on a major offshore wind project for New York, but allowed it to resume in May.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-04 16:12:01+00:00,CT Mirror,Offshore wind leasing is officially dead under Trump,Clare Fieseler | Canary Media,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/04/offshore-wind-leasing-trump/,Over 3.5 million acres of federal waters are no longer eligible for offshore wind development following an order from the Interior Department.,"This story was originally published by Canary Media.
Offshore wind leasing is effectively dead in the U.S. following a Trump administration order issued this week.
Large swaths of U.S. waters that had been identified by federal agencies as ideal for offshore wind are no longer eligible for such developments under an Interior Department statement released Wednesday.
In the four-sentence statement, Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said the U.S. government is ​“de-designating over 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.”
The move comes just a day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered his staff to stop ​“preferential treatment for wind projects” and falsely called wind energy ​“unreliable.” Analysts say that offshore wind power can be a reliable form of carbon-free energy, especially in New England, where the region’s grid operator has called it critical to grid stability. It also follows the Trump administration’s monthslong assault on the industry, which has included multiple attacks on in-progress projects.
The outlook was already grim for new offshore wind leasing activity following President Donald Trump’s executive order in January that introduced a temporary ban on the practice. Wednesday’s announcement makes that policy more definitive. Wind power advocates say it will erase several years of work from federal agencies and local communities to determine the best possible areas for wind development.
“My read on this is that there is not going to be any leasing for offshore wind in the near future,” said a career employee at the Interior Department, who Canary Media granted anonymity so they could speak freely without fear of retribution.
Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official ​“wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.
Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as ​“Central Atlantic 2,” which started back in 2023 and is now dead in the water.
The draft area — or ​“call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby wind turbines could interfere with the agency’s instrumentation and radio frequencies.
The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was hosting in-person public meetings from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Morehead City, North Carolina, to gather input from fishermen, tourism outfitters, and other stakeholders. Under a wind-friendly administration, a final designation and lease sale notice would have likely been released this year or by 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.
But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.
Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s ​“big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.
Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2 and similar areas, like one near Guam, and also revokes completely finalized wind energy areas with strong state support. One example is in the Gulf of Maine, where Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for the emerging renewable sector.
These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25189604014878-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-04 12:56:57.448051

Peter Bell, producer of the “Sons of Patriarchy” podcast, and reporter Sarah Stankorb will host a live recording and Q&A session at the Kenworthy Theater in Moscow, Idaho, on Friday at 4 p.m. — deliberately timed to coincide with Christ Church’s Grace Agenda conference.
Bell’s podcast, which launched in October 2024, focuses on exposing what he describes as abuse and Christian nationalism within Christ Church Moscow and the broader Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches denomination.
Christ Church in Moscow, led by Wilson for more than 40 years, boasts about 3,000 congregants in the town of 25,000 and operates what critics describe as “a communal ecosystem” of affiliated businesses and institutions throughout Moscow’s downtown.
Bell said the event is strategically planned to “crash” Grace Agenda, which he described as “the biggest recruiting conference” for the church. The Grace Agenda conference runs Aug. 8-9 and features seminars, concerts and community events throughout Moscow, all themed around C.S. Lewis’ Narnia series.
The Sons of Patriarchy event will feature a live podcast recording with Bell and Stankorb discussing her upcoming book about women leaving churches — women who have been “hurt by church, hurt in church,” according to Bell. He also said the book relays how these women “deal with this, stats behind it [and] best practices for leaving/resources.” This will be followed by an unfiltered Q&A session.
“Any question that comes in, we’ll do our best to answer, or provide resources,” Bell said.
Stankorb has emerged as a key figure in exposing Christ Church Moscow’s culture. Her 2021 VICE article detailed allegations of abuse within the church community, including accounts of marital rape and spiritual abuse, under the headline “Inside the Church That Preaches ‘Wives Need to Be Led with a Firm Hand.'”
“The article opened many eyes to the church’s teachings and practices,” Bell said. 
Stankorb, who identifies as agnostic while Bell is Christian, brings extensive journalistic work on the subject.
Bell said they have multiple objectives for the visit.
“We want to meet the people we’ve talked about, talked to and see how they’re doing since all this has come out,” he said.
Bell also said he wants to “plant seeds of disillusionment in the Moscow community, especially with Kirkers and those in the church by showing there’s a bigger and brighter world outside of this that has better answers to the questions you’re asking.”
He said he hopes Wilson will reach out and invite him for a discussion, though he did not notify Wilson in advance about their visit.
This is the Sons of Patriarchy’s first visit to Moscow, and Bell plans to spend the weekend in the area throughout Grace Agenda. The crew plans to return for future visits.
“This is not the only visit. We want to make this as much of a regular thing as we can,” Bell said.
Wilson has previously dismissed the podcast, telling media he expected “Sons of Patriarchy” to consist of “recycled (and refuted) defamation and slander.”
Bell said Wilson knows they exist and has mentioned the podcast in a few blog posts, making jokes about it. However, he has not engaged directly with the producers.
The free Sons of Patriarchy event at the Kenworthy Theater has 250-300 seats available, though Bell expects those to go fast. Overflow viewing will be available at Cafe Artista via YouTube livestream. A donor paid for the venue space.
Free tickets go live Monday (Aug. 4), on EventBrite.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)U.S. families lose nearly $350 billion each year due to the incarceration of a loved one in jail or prison, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.
The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.
New York becomes latest state to offer free phone calls in prisons

The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.
Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

Susan Ruiz, a Democrat, addressed a crowd that gathered outside the Lenexa El Toro Loco Mexican Bar and Grill on July 30 after some of the employees were arrested earlier in the day by agents with Homeland Security (Mary Sanchez/The Beacon).The economic power of the Latino population in the United States is as massive as it is misunderstood.
Latinos contribute more than $3.7 trillion annually to the economy, more than the gross domestic product of all but four countries in the world.
Latinos are the nation’s largest minority group with 64 million people.

The vast majority, eight out of 10, are U.S. citizens.
By 2030, one out of every three people entering the workforce will be Latino.
But acknowledgement of those facts is lacking, studies show, especially among policymakers and politicians.
The vacuum leaves space for false narratives to flourish.
One example for the leader of the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization is the Trump administration’s inaccurate labeling of Latinos as criminals and outsiders who don’t contribute to the nation.
“If we’re going to have an economy that really moves the country forward and sustains all of us, it has to include the Latino community from a demographics perspective,” said Janet Murguía.
Murguía, a native of Kansas City, Kansas, is president and CEO of UnidosUS, which is holding its annual conference in Kansas City Aug. 4-7.
The conference opens days after nearly a dozen people were taken from their jobs at two Kansas El Toro Loco Mexican Bar and Grill locations in morning raids by Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The detentions of the employees were filmed and witnessed by community members and sparked a protest later in the day.
Videos show the employees as they were being taken from the restaurants in handcuffs and with chains around their waists. Food was left cooking at the Lenexa location and a handwritten note “Closed” was taped to the front door, which was left unlocked.
Murguía is critical of some tactics that Homeland Security is using in its efforts to meet the administration’s goal of removing 3,000 undocumented immigrants daily.
Increasingly, she said, what’s happening is unlawful and unconstitutional.
“This is not about immigration,” Murguía said. “It’s about civil rights.”
Negative narratives about Latinos that are unsubstantiated by data are being used to justify the actions, including some actions that shred due process, she said.
UnidosUS is the umbrella organization for more than 300 affiliates spread across virtually every state. Three are in the Greater Kansas City area: El Centro, the Guadalupe Centers and Mattie Rhodes Center.
The nearly 60-year-old organization’s current strategy is three-pronged — to protect, defend and advance the Latino community.
Murguía served in former President Bill Clinton’s administration and also once served as an executive vice chancellor at the University of Kansas.
She said abuse of power and government overreach in immigration enforcement must be challenged.
“We intend to do everything we can to provide the advocacy to push back against this and demand accountability in the courts and through the administration and in Congress,” Murguia said.
Partnerships with other civil rights organizations will be key, she said, noting deep connections with the leadership of the National Urban League, the National Action Network and the Legal Defense Fund.
“This is about our civil rights being destroyed,” she said. “Partners and allies can be really critically important in communicating that to the broader public and understanding that we’re all threatened in this country when actions happen.”
 ‘There is no American agenda without a Latino agenda’ 

UnidosUS is linking with some of the leading researchers in the nation.
Documenting the social and economic impact of mass deportation will be crucial.
Some immigrant families are of mixed status, with at least one family member who might be undocumented and others who are not.
Approximately 6.6 million American citizens, including 5.5 million U.S. children — over 8% of all children in the U.S. — live in a household with at least one undocumented family member.
A 2017 study predicted that removing one family member from every mixed-status household through deportation would drop the median income of those households by nearly 50%.
The report was written with data compiled by the Center for Migration Studies of New York and published by the Journal on Migration and Human Security.
“Removing undocumented residents from mixed-status households would reduce median household income from $41,300 to $22,000, a drop of $19,300, or 47%, which would plunge millions of US families into poverty,” the report noted.
The ramifications on homeownership, businesses and taxes paid could be dramatic.
If the U.S. removed all of its undocumented residents, “gross domestic product (GDP) would be reduced by 1.4% in the first year, and cumulative GDP would be reduced by $4.7 trillion over 10 years,” the report said.
Updated data will be key to track not only the outcomes of current immigration policy but also the Trump administration’s recently approved budget bill. UnidosUS called it “a stunning betrayal to working families, vulnerable communities and the American electorate who entrusted them with their votes” due to its cuts to health programs and food assistance.
Studies can also inform a wide range of initiatives that have long been the focus of UnidosUS: homeownership, educational attainment, health, voting rights and political empowerment.
 Data to support policy, based on understanding Latino history

UnidosUS has partnered with the Latino Politics & Policy Institute) at the University of California Los Angeles.
The institute’s motto is “there is no American agenda without a Latino agenda,” a statement that underscores the relevance of Latinos historically, by population, economic output and future projections as a young demographic.
Latinos are contributing nearly $4 trillion annually to the economy, said Rodrigo Domínguez-Villegas, director of research at the UCLA institute.
Yet Latinos hold only 12% of the nation’s household wealth while comprising nearly 20% of the population, he said.
“There’s a disconnect that reveals a system where Latino labor and entrepreneurship are fueling economic growth in the country, but the wealth that’s generated through Latino labor and entrepreneurship is held elsewhere,” he said.
Domínguez-Villegas is leading a project to find out why.
In a partnership with UnidosUS, the institute is completing an analysis of how public policy has shaped Latino wealth.
The economic mobility study will be released in October.
“We are telling the story of Latino communities across the country and what Latinos contribute, and also how Latinos struggle because of systemic and historical disadvantages,” he said.

Mattie Rhodes, one of the Kansas City-based UnidosUS affiliates, will release the Hispanic/Latino Equity Index for the Kansas City area’s Latino population during the convention on Aug. 4.
The report was developed with the University of Missouri-Kansas City’s Center for Economic Information and the Urban League of Greater Kansas City.
It will highlight disparities in economic opportunity, health, education, social justice and civic engagement.
Similar local reports can be aided by another initiative at the UCLA institute, the Latino Data Hub.
It’s an interactive platform to analyze conditions affecting Latinos nationwide, drawing from the 2023 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census.
An updated hub was released in mid-July. And tutorials on how to use the hub are ongoing.
“We have tried to build it in a way that is as intuitive as possible,” said Domínguez-Villegas, who will be attending the UnidosUs conference. “Our target audiences are, of course, policymakers, but also community-based organizations and the media.”
Information can be broken down nationally, by state or county and soon, by congressional districts.
Built into the platform are 130 indicators, with filters for people to search for detailed information such as homeownership, health care access and educational attainment. The information can be searched in English or Spanish.
The Latino Data Hub grew out of the COVID pandemic, when Latino communities were disproportionately impacted in terms of hospitalizations and deaths.
Policymakers were surprised and slow to react, said Domínguez-Villegas, because they hadn’t understood Latino health disparities and access to health care that predated the pandemic.
“Policymakers were like, ‘Oh, we didn’t have this data, so we didn’t understand really, how to incorporate that into the response,’” said Domínguez-Villegas.
Researchers, he said, vowed “never again.”
Strong data can help tell the stories of Latinos and build understanding of past struggles that have led to current inequities, while also addressing the demographic’s contributions. The goal is a more nuanced telling of the nation’s extremely diverse Latino communities.
 Sharing the American Dream

Previous work between UnidosUS and the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy found deep gaps in the inclusion of Latinos in U.S. history curriculum.
The lack of accurate information undercuts awareness.
The buying power of the Hispanic market can be shown in telling stories of entrepreneurship and those who find prosperity by catering to the demographic, in all of its vast diversity.
A prime local example is the success of the El Mercado Fresco supermarkets, which began catering primarily to the Latino immigrant communities in northeast Kansas City about a decade ago.
The company’s ninth store opened July 17 in a former Big Lots at 7533 State Ave. in Kansas City, Kansas.
Hundreds of people, many of them Latino, gathered in the parking lot for the ribbon cutting and then formed a long line, patiently waiting to file into the store to shop as a mariachi band serenaded.
Carlos Gomez, president/CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City, helped with the honors.
Gomez said the El Mercado groceries are successful, in part, because of the owner’s respectful relationship with the Latino community, giving back philanthropically and through hiring.
The owner, Eddie Musallet, said he sources products through a wide range of vendors to cater to the culinary preferences of many ethnicities, including Asian and African people.
Musallet said he’s conscientious of people’s budgets and tries to use local farmers for some products.
Packages of 30 eggs, locally sourced, were marked $6.99 at the State Avenue opening.
Soon, a group of leaders gathered outside the store, chatting as friends found one another  in the crowd.
David Carranza, economic development director for the city of Grandview, Missouri, said that Latinos know how to “make something from nothing,” guided by entrepreneurial efforts and often working not only one, but two jobs.
“We’re survivors,” Carranza said.
Murguia echoed the sentiments of local leadership in her resolve to advocate and organize through current political and policy challenges.
Latinos, she said, are known for optimism and resilience, holding a deep belief in the promise of the nation and its ability to allow people to carve out their American Dream.
“If you fundamentally believe that about this country, you’re not going to give up, even in the most daunting times,” Murguia said. “We’re leaning into every bit of resilience and optimism in this moment.”

However, a Republican and Democrat encouraged speculation about themselves as candidates in the state’s 2027 governor’s race. 
While addressing party faithful — Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman at a Democratic dinner and U.S. Rep. James Comer at a Republican breakfast — mentioned the future statewide races. Both have been seen as possible candidates for the governor’s race, which would be wide open with Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear term-limited.

Coleman did not attend the annual church picnic in West Kentucky Saturday, but she was one of the speakers at the Marshall County Democrats’ Mike Miller Memorial Bean Dinner the Friday night before. She said not being on the ballot this year factored into her decision to skip the picnic. The picnic typically features politicians as they trade roasts in front of an energetic crowd. 
“Although, I do hear that there are some races, like in 2027, that might bring me back to the Fancy Farm stage. I don’t know. We’ll see,” she said, earning chuckles and applause from the room. 
Asked to clarify by reporters after her speech, Coleman said “It just means I might be back. Well, you never know.” 
Coleman, who has been elected as lieutenant governor twice on Beshear’s ticket, is seen as a top candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2027 governor’s race. Another rumored candidate is Beshear’s senior adviser Rocky Adkins, a former House Democratic floor leader from Eastern Kentucky who ran against Beshear in the 2019 primary. 
However, Comer told the Graves County GOP Breakfast Saturday morning that he believes Kentucky Democrats will nominate Coleman. 
“There’s no question in my life. I mean, it’s going to be Jackie Coleman, the lieutenant governor,” Comer said. 
The congressman then added what he said was the “problem” with Coleman running. He told Republicans that “she is so irrelevant and unknown” that if she was in a picture between two Kentucky icons, boxer Muhammad Ali and University of Kentucky men’s basketball coach Mark Pope, that the average Kentuckian still couldn’t identify her.
Throughout the day, some Republican speakers hinted that Comer should run for governor himself. Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell was the most enthusiastic of them, saying Comer should get in the race at the Republican breakfast and again on the Fancy Farm Picnic stage.
“I’m for Jamie Comer for governor. Please run. Please,” Shell said at the breakfast as the room erupted with cheers.

Comer told reporters after the picnic that it’s not a secret that “I’m very interested in” the governor’s race, but he’s about a year away from making a decision as he is currently running for his U.S. House seat again in the 1st Congressional District in 2026. 
Before he was elected to Congress in 2016, Comer served as the state’s agriculture commissioner and in the state House of Representatives. He sought the Republican nomination for governor in 2015, but lost the primary to former Gov. Matt Bevin by 83 votes. On the national stage, Comer gained notoriety as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee and leading probes into President Joe Biden and his family. 
As for the current support, Comer said he’s “humbled” to hear encouragement from all over the state. He believes some of the reason is because of his rural background, which could win support from voters outside of the state’s urban areas. 
“The Democrats have dominated the Kentucky governor’s race as much as any race in America. Even states like New York and New Jersey … the Republicans have had more success,” Comer said. “So, we’ve got to look at who we nominate. “
When asked why he thought the Democratic nominee would be Coleman over Adkins, Comer said Adkins’ record of being “pro-life” on abortion issues and not backing strict gun control laws could cost him support among more liberal Democratic voters, particularly in Lexington and Louisville. 
“Unless something happens, Jackie Coleman’s (the) overwhelming favorite to be the Democrat nominee for governor,” Comer said. 
Stephen Voss, a political science professor, said Comer “isn’t wrong” when it comes to ideologues and activists struggling to back candidates in cases where “the demand for ideological purity means losing.” Regular voters can be more strategic. Voss pointed to the 2020 presidential election, a race where Joe Biden wasn’t the first choice for a lot of Democratic voters but it was more important to them to beat Donald Trump. 
“Comer lost nothing by campaigning against the lieutenant governor. It’s not as though these words cost money, and if he ends up being wrong, and his primary Democratic opponent ends up being someone else, he’s done himself no measurable harm by going after her,” Voss said. “The important thing is he’s auditioning for the role of ‘Republican who’s going to attack the Democratic nominee for governor.’”
If Comer had publicly attacked another rumored Republican candidate, he “steps on toes” and could give publicity to a primary opponent, Voss said. This move doesn’t offend GOP primary voters. 
Asked if Comer could have risked sending Democrats the message that Adkins is a stronger candidate, Voss said “if Democratic strategists don’t already know that Rocky Adkins would be a strong candidate, then God help them.”
In addition to Comer, some have speculated that possible Republican candidates for 2027 could include term-limited Secretary of State Michael Adams and former Republican Senate Floor Leader Damon Thayer.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)A coalition including 15 state attorneys general have filed a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s effort to restrict access to medically-necessary care for transgender, intersex and nonbinary youth.
The lawsuit challenges recent federal action to deter doctors and medical providers from offering gender affirming care to youth under the age of 19 years old, including states like Michigan where that care is legal and protected.
Joining the suit are the attorneys general of Michigan, New York, California, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
“The Trump administration shouldn’t be interfering with the provision of health care,” said Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul in a statement Friday. “The administration should be respecting individual liberty and equal rights, not shamefully targeting transgender people.”
The attorneys general have asserted that President Donald Trump’s White House is overstepping its authority, using threats of criminal prosecution and federal investigations to pressure health care providers.
“The Trump Administration is attempting to strip away lawful, essential healthcare from vulnerable youth. These orders are illegal and dangerous and have no medical or scientific basis,” said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in a statement. “I will continue to protect families, defend doctors, and stop politicians from putting our kids’ lives at risk.”
Trump in the beginning of his second administration signed an executive order stating that the U.S. would only recognize two sexes, and called for an end to what Trump labeled “gender ideology.” A second order focused on medical restrictions, directing the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue enforcement actions related to that care.
Since then, Nessel’s office said the Department of Justice has issued subpoenas to providers under the guise of criminal law enforcement, but the attorneys general filing the lawsuit Friday argue those efforts lack legal standing and are intended only to intimidate.
“Health care decisions for kids should be made by parents and doctors, not by politicians,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group, in a statement. “The federal government is using funding as a weapon to force providers to abandon their patients and override parents’ rights to make health care decisions for their own children.”
Patricia Wells, a doctor and the medical director of The Corner Health Center in Ypsilanti, Michigan, said in a statement that she and her colleagues are distressed by new punitive changes to funding and regulations, which threaten to dismantle essential care.
“These policies do not protect children; they endanger them,” Wells said. “They undermine trust in the medical system and place affirming providers in an impossible position, forcing hospitals to close clinics and providers to stop offering the very care that helps young people survive and thrive. The loss of these services would not simply be a policy failure; it would be a moral one.”
Wells said the nation must do better.
“These young people deserve our compassion, our evidence-based care, and our unwavering commitment to their well-being,” she said. “I applaud the leadership of the state of Michigan for protecting transgender and gender nonconforming youth, their families, and the caregivers who are saving lives every day.”

Starting Aug. 1, New York will offer free phone calls in state prisons, becoming the sixth state to do so — and the first to enact the policy without legislation. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York will offer free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons starting Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so.
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.
The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

Article Summary

Texas Democrats fled to Illinois Sunday night in an effort to block a vote to bolster the state’s number of Republican lawmakers in Congress.
JB Pritzker called the Texas GOP’s effort “cheating” at the request of President Donald Trump.
Pritzker defended Illinois’ congressional map, which was drawn to put 14 Democrats in Congress and three Republicans.
Illinois Republicans accused the state’s Democrats of hypocrisy.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Gov. JB Pritzker welcomed a contingent of Texas House Democrats to Chicago Sunday night as part of a strategy to delay a vote in Austin on a mid-decade redistricting plan designed to give Republicans an additional five congressional seats in next year’s midterm elections.
The Texas Legislature is currently meeting in a special session originally called to deal with several issues including massive floods in the central part of the state that left more than 100 people dead last month. The subject of congressional redistricting was added to the agenda at the urging of President Donald Trump, according to the Texas Tribune.
Republicans control the Texas House by an 88-62 margin, but Texas requires at least two-thirds of the members be present for the House to conduct business. By fleeing the state, Democrats have effectively shut down business in the House and made it impossible for Texas law enforcement officials to compel them to return to the Statehouse.
“We’re not here because this is easy,” Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said at a news conference Sunday night with Pritzker at the DuPage County Democratic headquarters in Carol Stream. “And we did not make a decision to come here today – we did not make a decision lightly. But we come here today with absolute moral clarity that this is absolutely the right thing to do to protect the people of the state of Texas.”
The U.S. Constitution requires states to redraw congressional district lines following each decennial census to ensure equal representation. But it does not specifically prohibit states from drawing new maps more frequently.
In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that partisan gerrymandering – drawing district lines with the intent of giving one party an advantage over another – is a political issue that is beyond the power of courts to resolve and can only be addressed through state or federal legislation.
Nonetheless, Pritzker accused Trump and Texas Republicans of “cheating” by attempting to redraw maps halfway through a census cycle.
“The cheating here is the fact that we are midstream in 2025 and they want to rewrite the map, and for only one reason,” he said. “The cult leader of their party tells them to do it because he knows he’s going to lose control of the House of Representatives” after the midterm elections.
‘Height of hypocrisy’ 
Pritzker has made similar comments in recent weeks as Texas Republicans moved forward with their plans, prompting sharp replies from Illinois Republicans who argue that Illinois has some of the most partisan gerrymandered maps in the country.
“Texas Democratic legislators walking out to come to the most rigged state in the country at the invitation of a governor who broke his promise to voters not once, but twice, to create the most gerrymandered maps in the nation is the height of hypocrisy,” Senate Minority Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, said in a statement. “Governor Pritzker and his legislative allies have already rigged Illinois with a 14-3 Congressional map that is shameless in its attempt to remove choice from voters.”
Illinois’ map divides the state’s 17-member congressional delegation into 14 Democrat-leaning districts and three Republican-leaning districts. The three districts currently held by Republicans are mostly large, meandering rural areas.
Pritzker, however, defended the maps that the Democratic-controlled Illinois General Assembly pushed through in 2021.
“Let me be clear, we passed a map in Illinois that follows the Constitution, and that is not what Gov. Abbott is trying to do in Texas,” he said. “We believe that the people of Texas deserve to have fair representation and not to have the game changed in the middle of the decade.”
In a social media statement Sunday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton suggested the absent House Democrats should be arrested and returned to the Lone Star State.
“Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,” he said on X, formerly Twitter. “We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The expungement of a Jersey City police lieutenant’s 2019 arrest does not prevent the city from releasing an internal affairs report about the matter, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday in a case that pitted the New Jersey Monitor against the state’s second biggest city.
But, the court ruled in its unanimous decision, the state’s expungement statute bars the release of any information related to the lieutenant’s criminal case, so the justices sent the case back to lower courts for a judge to redact any such information from the internal report.
Justice Rachel Wainer Apter’s decision rejects Jersey City’s arguments that it could not release the report, but also rejects the New Jersey Monitor’s argument that a court could require release of the details of the lieutenant’s expunged criminal record under the common law even if their disclosure is barred by statute.
“The expungement statute bars a law enforcement agency from releasing any information that would reveal an arrest, conviction, or related proceeding that it knows has been expunged. We must respect and enforce the Legislature’s judgment,” Wainer Apter wrote (Chief Justice Stuart Rabner did not participate in the case).
Attorney CJ Griffin, who represented the New Jersey Monitor, said Monday’s ruling expands access to information about police misconduct by barring Jersey City from shielding the public from knowing more about the officer in question’s “wildly dangerous actions that could have easily killed someone.”
But Griffin noted that the ruling also requires a judge to redact from the report any references to Timmins’ arrest and criminal case.
“We know what occurred in this case because of prior public disclosures, but what if we didn’t? The redactions would keep the public from monitoring how prosecutors give officers special treatment. Or it could even lead the public to assume that this officer engaged in this lawless behavior, yet was not arrested like any other civilian would be,” she said.

States Newsroom, the New Jersey Monitor’s parent nonprofit, sued Jersey City in 2022 after the city denied an Open Public Records Act request seeking the internal affairs report, which documents the incident that spurred criminal charges against Jersey City Police Lt. Michael Timmins.
Authorities charged Timmins with terroristic threats and possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose after they say he fired a shotgun at party guests after consuming six to eight beers at his Sussex County home in August 2019.
Jersey City officials rejected the records request, saying the internal report is confidential. Timmins subsequently had his record expunged after pleading guilty to a lesser charge and entering a pretrial intervention program. Afterward the city said it would be unlawful for them to hand over the report.
Though internal affairs reports are not releasable under the Open Public Records Act, New Jersey’s Supreme Court in 2022 ruled they can be disclosed under the common law right of access when the public interest outweighs officers’ privacy interests.
Monday’s decision says Timmins’ expungement does not shield the release of the internal affairs report because that report is not a criminal investigatory document subject to expungement. That means that, while the arresting police department could not disclose documents concerning the incident or even acknowledge the arrest, the Jersey City Police Department could not wholly withhold its report on its internal investigation of Timmins’ behavior.
“The JCPD need not, however, refrain from revealing information about the underlying incident that led to both the lieutenant’s arrest and its IA investigation,” Wainer Apter wrote. “And it need not refrain from revealing information about its IA investigation into whether JCPD rules or regulations were violated.”
The justices ordered a trial court judge to review the internal affairs report and redact any information it contains related to Timmins’ arrest, charges, and the disposition thereof before conducting a balancing test to determine whether the public interest in releasing the internal affairs report outweighs the officer’s privacy interests.
Timmins’ arrest was first made public in 2021 pursuant to a state attorney general order requiring towns to identify officers who face discipline of more than five days (Timmins was suspended for 90 days). That report said only that Timmins “negligently discharged a firearm while off duty and on his personal property.”
More details emerged because prosecutors were forced to share details of his arrest with defense attorneys as part of an unrelated murder case because Timmins responded to the scene of that homicide. A police report shared with defense attorneys said witnesses at Timmins’ 2019 party told police Timmins got in a fight with his daughter’s boyfriend, then fired a gun at party guests.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Health administered no immunizations at seven of the 11 special measles vaccine clinics it publicly announced recently, and a total of 14 vaccinations were administered at the other four clinics.
The department announced the locations, dates and times of the special clinics in a news release on June 18, and announced an amended schedule in another news release on June 20.
Of the 11 cities where clinics were scheduled, nine clinics were single days and two were multiple days.
The news releases did not say whether the vaccinations were free. The department has since told South Dakota Searchlight via email, “Vaccines are provided at no cost when insurance isn’t an option, with eligibility assessed to ensure everyone can get vaccinated without barriers.”
When the department announced the schedule for the special clinics, the state had detected four measles cases since the beginning of the year. That number has since risen to 12, including one hospitalization. Ten of the cases are unvaccinated people. The vaccination status of the other two is unknown.
Prior to last year, the state hadn’t experienced a confirmed measles case since 2015. Measles vaccination rates among South Dakota schoolchildren have fallen since then from 96% to 90%.
Similar trends in some other states have contributed to the worst measles year in the United States since 1990. This year’s nationwide numbers now stand at 1,333 cases and three deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It took South Dakota Searchlight three weeks to obtain the results of the special vaccination clinics from the state Department of Health. The department, which declined multiple requests for an interview and communicated only by email, initially refused to provide the numbers. 
“In certain locations, the number of clients served is small enough that confidentiality laws prevent us from releasing those specific vaccine counts,” the department wrote.
The department did not respond to Searchlight’s request for a specific law citation supporting its position.

After Searchlight submitted another request for the information, this time through a state records request portal instead of by email, the department responded with data.
“We’ve discussed this request in detail internally and with our legal counsel,” the department wrote. “We believe we can share these numbers as long as they are provided simply as counts of people vaccinated, with no additional patient information.”
Searchlight had never asked for additional patient information.
The data provided by the department included additional cities and days beyond those announced in the June news releases. Searchlight had to perform its own analysis of the data to determine the results of only the announced clinics.
The department sent a written response when asked to explain the inclusion of the extra data, and pointed to a webpage containing information on measles vaccination clinics.
“First, some clinics took place before the release was distributed,” the department wrote. “Second, clinic schedules and locations continued to shift after the release was issued. While our team worked diligently to keep the website as current as possible, the details were changing daily.”
The department also said it offers immunizations daily at its public health nursing offices around the state. There have been 6,092 measles vaccinations so far this year in South Dakota, the department said, compared to 4,868 at the same time last year.

Northfield, Vermont
Died July 30, 2025
Boise, Idaho
Details of services
There will be a memorial service at the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery in Boise at a later date.


Kathryn Louise Maloney Youngerman was born in Northfield, Vermont on January 26, 1929 to Floyd A. and Freda E. (Wheeler/Riley) Maloney. She died on July 30, 2025.
Kay grew up in a loving family on a farm in Berlin, VT with her older brother, Bill, and her three younger siblings Bob, Betty, and John as well as many foster children who came and lived with the family. She attended a one room school house just up Cox Brook Road and was the first person in her family to graduate from high school (Northfield High School, class of 1947). Kay attended and, in 1950, graduated from the Mary Fletcher School of Nursing as a Registered Nurse. Her first nursing job was at the Green Mountain Clinic in Northfield where she met a handsome Norwich University cadet who delivered laundry. They fell in love and she and Stephenson Searles Youngerman Jr. were married on June 9, 1951, a union that lasted 69 years.
Steve graduated from Norwich the day after their wedding. He and Kay moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina as Steve was in the U.S. Army and stationed at Fort Bragg. While living in North Carolina, Kay was a hospital nurse as well as a new mother to Stephanie and Sydney. When Steve was discharged, they moved to Connecticut, Northfield and Cabot, VT, Alturas, CA and eventually, in 1957, to Hyde Park, VT where they lived for six years. While in Hyde Park, Steve III was born and Kay worked at Copley Hospital in Morrisville, VT. In the summers, she vaccinated children against polio all over the State of Vermont as a mobile vaccination clinic nurse. 
In 1963 the family moved to Strafford, VT. Kay worked as a private duty nurse and for two summers as the nurse at Camp Wihakowi in Northfield. In 1967, the family moved to Michigan. Kay was a public health nurse in Flint and a hospital nurse for the Veterans Administration in Ann Arbor. In 1969 the family moved to Boise, ID and Kay began a 28 year career with the State of Idaho Health and Welfare Department. She found her true calling as a public health nurse and especially enjoyed the time she spent working with new mothers and their babies. Wherever Steve got a new job, Kay transferred to that location and worked for offices in Boise, St. Marie’s, Twin Falls, and Nampa, ID before their final move back to Boise in 1989. She retired in 1997 as a nursing home examiner. 
Above all, Kay was devoted to her family and loved her children unconditionally. She and Steve enjoyed having large, family dinners in their home at every holiday. No matter where they lived, they created a welcoming, safe, warm, and sustaining place and made lifelong friends. Kay and Steve hosted their niece, Lucinda Powers (Walker) when she was a page in the Idaho Senate, two Rotary foreign exchange students from Australia, as well as any number of friends their children brought home, many of whom stayed for a few months to a year. 
Kay loved coffee, chocolate, and apricot pie. She was a great cook and she gave her children free rein in the kitchen so that they could learn to cook too. When living in Flint, MI she signed the girls and herself up for a cake decorating class and really got into it, buying all of the supplies to create beautiful cakes. She always had a batch of chocolate chip, snickerdoodle or ginger cookies in the cookie jar and her brownies were famous. She was a 4-H volunteer and taught her daughters as well as the neighborhood girls how to sew.
Kay laughed easily, had a great sense of humor, and was fun to be with. She loved to play board games, but Scrabble was her favorite. She couldn’t resist a crossword puzzle or an Avon catalog. She grew dahlias, iris, and Christmas cactus that were the envy of every neighborhood she lived in. During her retirement, Kay was active in PEO hosting many luncheons, working at and donating her homemade jams and jellies to the PEO Christmas bazaar and enjoying the camaraderie of her PEO sisters. 
Snow skiing was her favorite outdoor sport. For as long as they lived in the Treasure Valley, Steve and Kay had season passes at Bogus Basin and purchased them for their children and grandchildren. In her retirement years, Kay honed her skiing skills, participating in many Prime Timer slalom events and coming home with more than one medal. She and Steve spent many years basking in the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico in January and June, canoeing at Wade Lake, MT in August, and attending high school, college and family reunions in Vermont in October.
Kay is survived by her daughters Stephanie (Robert Jahn) and Sydney (Steven Cole), her son Steve (Julie Herndon), her grandchildren Riley (Sara Spencer), Kyle, Gretchen, and Stevie Youngerman, Morgan (Shawn) Keating, and Hadley (Josh) Goff, her great grandchildren Kennedy, Cason, Paige, Boden, and Jordi, her sister, Elizabeth Maloney Powers, and numerous nieces, nephews, and second cousins. She was preceded in death by her husband, Stephenson, her half sister, Ruth Riley, her three brothers, William, Robert, and John Maloney and great granddaughter, Dani. A huge thank you goes out to the staff at CornerStone Senior Living: Memory Care who took great care of “Nurse Kay” for the past seven and a half years and to Keystone Hospice who provided additional care for nearly five years. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Cottey College: P.E.O. Foundation, Giving Opportunities – Cottey College or the Idaho Foodbank: Donate – The Idaho Foodbank.

Kaohly Her announced on Monday she’s running for mayor of St. Paul.
Her previously worked as policy director for St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, whom she’ll challenge on Nov. 4, during his first term and has served in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2018.
“We need a mayor who is ready to step up, engage with the community, and provide focused leadership that will move our city forward,” Her said in a press release announcing her candidacy. “My story is the story of the American Dream – but for many, that dream is no longer attainable.”
With so little time before the election, Her will have to move quickly to raise money and assemble a campaign to challenge a two-term incumbent.
Her recently drew nationwide attention during the Minnesota Legislature’s June special session when she said she was “illegal” on the House floor.
“I am illegal in this country. My parents are illegal here in this country,” Her said.
In an interview with the Reformer, Her later said she was trying to inspire empathy in her Republican colleagues who were about to vote to take away state-funded health insurance for undocumented adults in Minnesota. She said that she and her parents are U.S. citizens who came to the U.S. as refugees from Laos.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)U.S. families lose nearly $350 billion each year due to the incarceration of a loved one in jail or prison, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.
The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.

The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.
Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas talks with reporter Jennifer Smith about a series of stories parsing the sprawling Trump tax and spending bill. They discuss why it’s so hard to know if Opportunity Zones have been effective, and why affordable housing advocates are mixed on the administration’s approach to low-income renters.
The post The[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Michael Jonas
GUEST: Jennifer Smith







A FEW PROPOSALS aimed at boosting investment in low-income communities came buried in the sprawling Trump tax and spend bill, which on the whole has been scorned by Democrats for its assaults on social services funding like Medicaid and SNAP benefits.  
President Trump signed the almost 900-page bill into law on July 4, after Republican leadership wrestled the bill through the House and Senate on largely party-line votes. 
On The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas and reporter Jennifer Smith discuss a few provisions of the tax package that are not straightforwardly reviled in Massachusetts – expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and making permanent the Opportunity Zones program. Smith recently wrote about the two provisions here and here.  
Both give tax breaks to developers who build projects aimed at low-income areas or populations, with the almost 40-year-old Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program set for its largest expansion in decades after years of bipartisan support. Affordable housing advocates and supply-side building boosters alike cheered the change, which they say could open the door to more than a million more homes aimed at low-income households in the next decade. 
The Opportunity Zones changes are more of a mixed bag, touted as a way to encourage investors to back projects in low-income census tracts by reducing their capital gains tax burden if they stay invested in those projects. Yet the limited data on the 2017 program found the zones that got new investment didn’t look all that different afterwards in measures like job creation or education attainment. Those areas had also already been on a slight upswing in the years before the program took effect.  
“There are two ways to read this,” Smith said. “The charitable read is that the zones are helping smooth the process for developers in areas that are getting better but aren’t still great investments. And the less charitable read is it’s giving these tax break for projects in areas that may have been more likely to attract them anyway while leaving distressed or rural or stagnated areas out.” 
While the two provisions in the sprawling domestic policy bill offer some hope to those on the bottom rungs of the economy, they do so through an approach Trump has long viewed favorably – tax breaks to well-off investors. When it comes to direct government spending to help those struggling to make ends meet, it’s been a very different story.  
Trump has proposed cuts to federal rental assistance programs like Section 8, which are sometimes crucial to low-income tenants being able to cover the rent in the affordable housing developments made possible through tax credits. 
All of that, Matt Noyes, of the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, told Smith for her recent story on the housing tax credits, adds up to policies that “are not rowing in the same direction.”  
During the episode, Smith and Jonas discuss Opportunity Zones (3:00), low-income housing (14:45), and the administration’s tax-cut-first philosophy (20:00).

(Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said her office was going to shed “sunlight” on the University of Iowa’s DEI policies through her office’s investigation following a request from Gov. Kim Reynolds earlier this week.
Bird spoke on the issue at the annual “Bird Barn Bash,” a fundraiser for the attorney general as she looks ahead to running for another term in 2026. Bird, who was first elected in 2022, spoke about her time challenging federal policies during former President Joe Biden’s tenure, but also spoke on a more recent issue – investigating UI for potential noncompliance with state and federal policies banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
Fox News published an “undercover” video Tuesday of a person identified as Andrea Tinoco, the assistant director of UI Leadership and Student Organization Development, who said her department was still committed to working on DEI despite directives from university leadership.
After the video was posted, Reynolds issued a statement saying she was “appalled” by the comments made in the video and would be filing a complaint to the Attorney General’s office for further action. On Friday, a second video was posted by Townhall, a conservative outlet, of another UI employee identified as Cory Lockwood, senior associate director of the Iowa Union Memorial, making similar comments about continued work on DEI initiatives.
Both employees featured in the videos have been placed on administrative leave.
At the fundraiser Saturday, Bird said her office has launched an investigation into the situation and “is going to get to the bottom of it” – but asked the crowd for patience.
“Please know – the investigation’s going to take a little bit,” Bird said. “I know all of us want it to be fast — and we will not make it be slow — but I’ll tell you, to do something right, it takes time. And we’re going to do it right, we’re going to do it by the book and by the law.”
She also reiterated her commitment to upholding the ban on DEI at Iowa’s regents universities, saying ”here in Iowa, our taxpayer-funded universities are supposed to be about education, not indoctrination.”
Talk radio host Simon Conway, who spoke in support of Bird at the event, said the UI investigation shows the importance of having Bird in office – and reelecting her for another term. He said former Attorney General Tom Miller, the longtime Democratic incumbent who Bird defeated in 2022, would not have followed up on Reynolds’ request to investigate the university if he was in office.
“If we had Tom Miller, or a Tom Miller, in the attorney general’s chair right now, with what is going on in our state in regards to DEI — I think first of all, there’d be a really good chance that regents universities would be losing federal funding,” Conway said. “They still might, by the way. But I think it’s an absolute given if he was there. And you don’t want to see that, do you?”
Cruz, Schmitt stay in D.C.
U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Eric Schmitt of Missouri were also scheduled to speak at the event, but both were unable to attend. The U.S. Senate was in session Saturday, with Senate Republicans aiming to confirm more than 100 of President Donald Trump’s nominees despite a breakdown in negotiations with Senate Democrats.
Bird said she was disappointed the two Republican senators could not be at the event, but that she told them on behalf of attendees, “we want you to do your job like you’re doing, confirming President Trump’s nominees.”
Schmitt will be back in the state later in the month, Aug. 23, for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s fundraiser in Cedar Rapids.
Bird was considered a top choice to become the next Republican nominee for governor in the 2026 election cycle, following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek reelection after finishing her current term. But in July, Bird announced she would not run for governor, instead running for reelection for her current position.
At the event, Bird said she had spoken with many people in the crowd about her plans in 2026 – and that her decision to run for reelection was because she believed there was still more she had to accomplish in the role.
“We’ve done some good things in the attorney general’s office to help Iowa but we are not done,” Bird said. “The work is not done. And I’m not going to leave that unfinished to run for something else.”

It worked on Matthew Morrison. In mid-July, the 69-year-old former psychiatric nurse supervisor quietly fled the United States.
Morrison had been threatened by an aggressive government before. When he was a teenager, he fought against what he and others in the Irish Republican Army saw as an occupying British government that discriminated against marginalized Catholics in Northern Ireland.
For his efforts then, Morrison said he was beaten by interrogators and wound up in prison, where some of his comrades died in a hunger strike protesting the revocation of their political status.

Upon his release in 1985, he feared for his safety. He came to St. Louis, married his American pen pal and had two children. Eventually, he overstayed his tourist visa, divorced his pen pal and remarried. He’s had the spectre of deportation hanging over him for decades. His family has endured the highs and lows of his battle along the way.
Now, Morrison leans on a cane. He’s had several strokes. He said that the fear and uncertainty that he might be picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was more than he could bear.
“I would bite the dust in an ICE holding cell,” Morrison told The Marshall Project – St. Louis before he left the U.S. “There is nothing to stop them from deporting me to Ecuador, South Sudan or whatever. It’s really gotten insane here. It’s crazy what they are doing now, the Trump administration. You know what I mean?”
Many noncitizens have faced similar unknowns in hiding. Morrison has been in the public eye for a long time. He’s been in and out of the news since the 1990s. He was even the grand marshal of a parade. But the U.S. government denied his petition for an adjustment in immigration status because of crimes he was convicted of during “The Troubles” conflict in Northern Ireland. Morrison had omitted those from his original tourist visa application.
In 2000, the Clinton administration terminated the deportation process against Morrison and five other named “deportees,” as the group of former Irish Republican Army prisoners was called, after the American spouses of the Irish men testified before Congress. The president himself weighed in on the issue.
“While in no way approving or condoning their past criminal acts,” Bill Clinton said then, according to a Washington Post story at the time, “I believe that removing the threat of deportation for these individuals will contribute to the peace process in Northern Ireland.”
The deportees were momentarily relieved. But because they weren’t on a path to citizenship, the six men still had to live with restrictions and regularly check in with the government. 
In May, Noel Gaynor, who had a heart condition, died at home in Olean, New York. Waiting months without annual work authorization approval, his Medicare and Social Security benefits were cut off, according to a video of statements made at his wake. In June, Gabriel Megahey received a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that The Marshall Project – St. Louis reviewed. It began: “It’s time for you to leave the United States.”
Morrison expected a similar letter. Though his work authorization expires in October, he didn’t want to sit around waiting and worrying. 
On July 21, he limped onto a one-way flight from Cleveland to Dublin, Ireland, with his wife, leaving behind a life that he’d built in the St. Louis area, including grown children, grandchildren and many friends. 
“I’ve come full circle,” Morrison said while still in the United States. “I came here as an immigrant and I am leaving as an immigrant, despite everything in between. The whole thing is a crazy, stressful situation.” 
 Matt Morrison holds a framed picture of his father, Matthew, in St. Louis on July 22, 2025. Matthew Morrison, an Irish immigrant who resided in the U.S. for 40 years, self-deported to Ireland on July 21 (Katie Moore/The Marshall Project).
There’s a city in Northern Ireland with two names. Protestants call it Londonderry. Catholics, like Morrison, call it Derry. 
Catholics felt discriminated against there. Without better options, Morrison said his childhood home didn’t have an indoor bathroom or hot water. He said the cramped home was raided by British soldiers stationed there to keep the peace between Protestants and Catholics and to ensure Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.
To resist, he helped build barricades around his neighborhood. On Jan. 30, 1972, 16-year-old Morrison and his father joined thousands of others in the streets of their city. The march for Catholic civil rights became known as Bloody Sunday after British troops fatally shot 14 unarmed people and injured others. 
To fight back, Morrison said he joined the Irish Republican Army. 
“There was no way to be indifferent,” he said.  
Three years later, while in college, he said he was arrested with two others for trying to gun down a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer. Again, there were two ways to look at it. To Morrison, it was an act of war. Others saw it as terrorism. 
Later, he’d claim he was choked and beaten during police interrogations, which left him deaf in one ear. Convicted of attempted murder, he was sent to a prison outside Belfast that became widely known for a hunger strike where 10 people died. 
Released in 1985, Morrison fled to St. Louis, where he soon married Francie Broderick, an American pen pal who’d protested in Northern Ireland. They had a son, Matt, then a daughter, Katie. For years, the family and their supporters rallied to bring awareness to their own troubles with immigration authorities.  
In 1998, CBS featured the Morrison family in a documentary titled “Before Your Eyes: Don’t Take My Daddy.” 
“I always felt that our campaign was an extension of the hunger strike,” said Broderick, now 77. 
They had a major breakthrough in 2000 when then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in a prepared statement that she had been advised by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to drop deportation proceedings against the deportees to “support and promote the process of reconciliation that has begun in Northern Ireland.”

The men could stay, but they still couldn’t apply for a green card, let alone U.S. citizenship, because of their deferred immigration status. 
“People don’t realize how much of a minefield U.S. immigration law is,” Morrison said.
Over the years, delayed work authorizations sidelined him from his job for months at a time, he said. He worked about 20 years as a nurse in Missouri, including stints at a children’s hospital and several state mental health facilities. He said he presented at the St. Louis County Police Academy on topics including mental health and deescalation tactics. 
“It doesn’t matter what I did, Immigration gave me no credit for it,” Morrison said. 
Homeland Security and ICE officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.
In June, before Morrison self-deported, a scheduled check-in with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in St. Louis put him and his family on edge. Their fears were heightened by stories about immigrants being detained at routine appointments, regardless of legal status. At the appointment, authorities took a photo of Morrison and he was free to go. 
“We were terrified that they were just going to take him right there,” said his son, Matt, 37. 
He said the uncertainty weighed on his father more than he’d ever seen. 
“He has to live under that fear of somebody knocking on the door and dragging him out of the house, just like they did in Derry when he was young,” Matt said. “I hate it. I am just worried about him. Until recently, I hadn’t heard him cry about it.”
He has mixed feelings about his father’s departure. 
“He’s got brothers and sisters over there, but we are all here — and his grandkids,” Matt said. “He spends a lot of time with his grandkids.” 
Morrison’s daughter, Katie Bradley, 34, said a recent farewell gathering, held in a backyard, felt like a funeral. She panicked because her U.S. passport had expired.
“Even though he’s still alive, I feel like I am grieving,” she said. “It’s a huge loss for me and my children.”
Morrison’s wife, Sandra Riley Swift, has a house in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as her mother and many grandchildren. After helping Morrison transition into an apartment in the town where he grew up, she said in a social media post that she’s going to straddle both countries for a while.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has upended the way covid vaccines are approved and for whom they’re recommended, creating uncertainty where coverage was routine.
Agencies within HHS responsible for spelling out who should get vaccinated aren’t necessarily in sync, issuing seemingly contradictory recommendations based on age or risk factors for serious disease.
But the ambiguity may not affect your coverage, at least this year.
“I think in 2025 it’s highly likely that the employer plans will cover” the covid vaccines, said Jeff Levin-Scherz, a primary care doctor who is the population health leader for the management consultancy WTW and an assistant professor at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They’ve already budgeted for it, “and it would be a large administrative effort to try to exclude coverage for those not at increased risk,” he said.
With so much in flux, it’s important to check with your employer or insurer about coverage policies before you roll up your sleeve.
Here’s what we know so far, and what remains unclear.
Q: How have the recommendations changed?
What used to be straightforward is now much murkier. Last year, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech covid vaccines were recommended for anyone at least 6 months old.
This year, the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is narrower. Although the vaccines are broadly recommended for adults 19 and older, they are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people or for healthy children 6 months through 17 years old.
Kennedy announced the changes in a video in May, citing safety risks for young people and pregnant people as justification.
But his claims have been widely disputed by experts in vaccines, pediatrics, and women’s health. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that the secretary “misrepresented scientific research to make unfounded claims about vaccine safety for pregnant people and children.”
In addition, recently announced changes to the vaccine approval framework have further chipped away at eligibility.
Moderna announced July 10 that the FDA had fully approved its Spikevax covid vaccine — but approval is restricted to adults 65 and older, and for people from 6 months through 64 years old who are at increased risk of developing a serious case of covid.
Two other covid vaccines expected to be available this fall, Novavax’s Nuvaxovid and Moderna’s mNexspike, are also restricted. They are approved for people 65 or older and those 12 to 64 who have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of developing severe covid.
Notably, Pfizer’s Comirnaty covid vaccine is still approved or authorized for people 6 months of age and older without any restrictions based on risk factors for covid — at least for now. But the FDA could change that at any time, experts said.
Increasing restrictions “is definitely the direction they are moving,” said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at KFF who authored a KFF analysis of vaccine insurance coverage rules. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
HHS did not provide an on-the-record comment for this article.
Q: How might these changes alter my insurance coverage for the vaccine?
That’s the big question, and the answer is uncertain. Without insurance coverage, people could owe hundreds of dollars for the shot.
Most private health plans are required by law to cover recommended vaccines, whether for covid, measles, or the flu, without charging their members. But that requirement kicks in after the shots are recommended by a federal panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — and adopted by the CDC director, according to the KFF analysis. The committee hasn’t yet voted on covid vaccine recommendations for this fall. Its next meeting is expected to occur in August or September.
Still, employers and insurers can opt to cover the vaccines on their own, as many did before the law required them to do so. But they may require people to pay something for it.
In addition, the narrower recommendations from different HHS agencies might result in some health plans declining to pay for certain categories of people to get certain vaccines, experts said.
“I don’t think an employer or insurer would deny coverage,” Kates said. “But they could say: You have to get this product.”
That could mean a 45-year-old with no underlying health conditions raising their covid risk might have to get the Pfizer shot rather than the Moderna version if they want their health plan to pay for it, experts said.
In addition, up to 200 million people may qualify for the vaccines because they have health conditions such as asthma or diabetes that increase their risk of severe disease, according to a commentary published by FDA officials in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Health care professionals can help people determine whether they qualify for the shot based on health conditions.
Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health plans, said in a statement that plans will continue to follow federal requirements for vaccine coverage.
Q: What are the options for people who are pregnant or have children they want to have vaccinated?
Many parents are confused about getting their kids vaccinated, according to a KFF poll released on Aug. 1. About half say they don’t know whether federal agencies recommend healthy children get the vaccine this fall. Among the other half, more say the vaccine is not recommended than recommended.
Meanwhile, Kennedy’s recommendation that healthy children not get vaccinated has a notable caveat: If a parent wishes a child to get a covid vaccine and a health care provider recommends it, the child can receive it under the “shared clinical decision-making” model, and it should be covered without cost sharing.
Some policy experts point out that this is the way care for kids is typically provided anyway.
“Outside of any requirements, vaccines have always been provided through shared decision-making,” said Amanda Jezek, senior vice president of public policy and government relations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
There’s no similar allowance for pregnant people. However, even though Kennedy has stated that covid vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people, pregnancy is one of the underlying medical conditions that put people at high risk for getting very sick from covid, according to the CDC. That could make pregnant people eligible for the shot.
Depending on the stage of someone’s pregnancy, it could be difficult to know whether someone should be denied the shot based on their condition. “This is uncharted territory,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.
Q: How will these changes affect access to the vaccine? Will I still be able to go to the pharmacy for the shot?
“If far fewer are expected to be vaccinated, fewer sites will offer the vaccinations,” Levin-Scherz said. This could be an especially notable hurdle for people looking for pediatric doses of a covid vaccine, he said.
In addition, pharmacists’ authority to administer vaccines depends on several factors. For example, in some states they can administer shots that have been approved by the FDA, while in others the shots must have been recommended by the ACIP, said Hannah Fish, senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Since ACIP hasn’t yet recommended covid shots for the fall, that could create a speed bump in some states.
“Depending on the rules, you still may be able to get the shot at the pharmacy, but they might have to call the physician to send over a prescription,” Fish said.
Q: What do these changes mean long-term?
It’s impossible to know. But given Kennedy’s vocal skepticism of vaccines and his embrace of long-disproven theories about connections between vaccines and autism, among other things, medical and public health professionals are concerned those views will shape future policies.
“The recommendation changes that were made with respect to children and pregnant women were not necessarily made in good science,” Corlette said.
It’s already a challenge to convince people they need annual covid shots, and shifting guidelines may make it tougher, some public health experts warn.
“What’s concerning is that this could even further depress the uptake of the covid vaccines,” Jezek said.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Coast Guard)A large cash infusion to the U.S. Coast Guard’s budget and recent comments by President Donald Trump are stoking optimism that the country’s limited icebreaker fleet might soon greatly expand. 
That’s according to shipbuilders, other businesspeople and some diplomats who spoke at the Arctic Encounter Symposium in Anchorage this week. Icebreakers are particularly important to Alaska, especially in the Bering Strait region where a narrow strip of water separates Alaska and Russia, a remote place where foreign vessels are often known to stray.

	The United States has three polar-grade icebreakers capable of navigating the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean, a waterbody that is rapidly warming due to climate change and seeing  new shipping routes opening in the process. The U.S.’s modest fleet compares to Russia’s hefty arsenal of some 40 icebreakers, including the world’s only nuclear-powered ones. 
As sea ice melts and vessel traffic increases in Alaska’s northern waters and elsewhere in the Arctic, fear of oil spills, vessel collisions and national security threats from foreign adversaries is on the rise. Against this backdrop, the U.S. and two allies, Canada and Finland, are trying to boost the production of icebreakers capable of navigating and protecting the Arctic. Their goal is to build between 70 and 90 icebreakers within the next decade, according to published reports.
The trilateral cooperation effort is spelled out in a guidance document called ICE Pact, which stands for Icebreaker Collaboration Effort. This memorandum of understanding was signed at a NATO summit in Washington last year.

	During a Thursday panel discussion at the Arctic conference, Paul Barrett of the Canadian shipbuilding company Davie noted that the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” builds off of ICE Pact in that it contains some $8 billion for the Coast Guard to expand its icebreaker fleet. 
Trump has said he wants the U.S. to build or acquire 40 new icebreakers to close the gap with Russia and to counter the growing influence of both Russia, and more recently China, in the Arctic. 
Barrett said his company is committed to helping make that happen. He outlined a $1 billion investment Davie is making to start building icebreakers at shipyards in Galveston and Port Arthur, cities in Texas. 
“This is about really equipping the U.S. shipbuilding sector for the decades ahead,” said Barrett, the company’s chief communications officer. “Our analysis is that we can help the Americans to build these ships that they need and we can create many thousands of jobs, good jobs, in America.” 
The massive spending and tax bill that Trump signed on July 4 contains $4.3 billion for the Coast Guard’s Polar Security Cutter program, to pay for three heavy icebreakers. There’s also $3.5 billion in the bill for three or more medium-grade icebreakers and about $800 million for light icebreakers.
The Coast Guard currently has two polar-grade icebreakers, and is getting a third, the Storis, which is scheduled to be commissioned in Juneau later this month. The Storis is the first polar icebreaker to be acquired by the Coast Guard in more than 25 years. 
During a question-and-answer period at Thursday’s session, Dennis Young, who heads the Alaska Division of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, asked why shipyards in Texas were chosen — as opposed to Alaska — for icebreaker construction. 
Building a generational workforce of shipbuilders in Seward, Ketchikan or another Alaska port town would be a “tremendous asset for our communities,” Young said.
William Henagan, U.S. strategy lead for Davie, said many factors played into the decision but an important one was that Texas has a much larger existing workforce of skilled shipbuilders.
“From my experience down in Galveston, they do a lot of fabrication work, so they’re already building steel for the existing contracts,” Henagan said. 
That said, Davie is “open for business” in Alaska and elsewhere.
“Paul and I are up here looking for opportunities and ways to collaborate with Alaska shipyards,” he said. 
Henagan noted that icebreakers are “50-year assets” that require a lot of ongoing maintenance. So even if the ships are built in Texas, there might be plenty of work for Alaska to capture once the icebreakers start operating in the Arctic.
There’s no doubt that Alaska and the U.S. need more icebreakers for security reasons, said former Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, a panelist. But he said the country needs to focus on the commercial aspects of the Arctic Ocean and step up its role in capturing rapidly emerging global commerce opportunities.

	“Let’s move forward with the concept of a marine seaway in the Arctic and figure out what the U.S. role is in helping convene the players to make that happen,” said Treadwell, a businessperson and former chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission.  
There’s talk that the U.S. secretary of transportation may visit Alaska this summer.
“Let’s all talk to him about it,” Treadwell said. “The fact is, we did this with Canada with the Saint Lawrence.”
He was referring to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System, built as a binational partnership between the U.S. and Canada. Administered by both countries, the seaway allows vessels to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. 
During Friday’s session on ICE Pact, Ambassador David Balton, who served as U.S. deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries during the Biden administration, said while there’s clearly a need for more U.S. icebreakers, he’s skeptical about the effectiveness of the trilateral partnership.
“Relations between the United States and Canada at the moment are not great,” Balton said.
The 35% U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods that went into effect on Friday have a chilling effect and have disrupted one of the largest and most successful trading relationships in the world, he said.
And it’s not just tariffs that are straining bilateral relations.
“Let’s not forget that President Trump has spoken multiple times about how Canada should be part of the United States, and it hasn’t gone down very well with our Canadian friends,” Balton said.
Arctic shipping represents a “paltry fraction” of oceangoing global trade, he noted, and Balton said he’s doubtful that’s going to radically change anytime soon.
Even under the most aggressive climate change models, the Arctic Ocean remains ice-covered for most of the year. 
There’s little existing land-based infrastructure to support large-scale Arctic shipping. Balton said it’s not clear to him that major shipping companies are going to retrofit their fleets to handle Arctic conditions for just a portion of the year, especially in a forbidding ocean that is poorly charted.
“There’s also unknown environmental consequences to large-scale Arctic shipping that we might want to stop and think about before embracing this brave new world that you’re imagining,” Balton said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)GRINNELL — “Everything’s gone.”
Grinnell City Administrator Jewel Maier is visibly shaken weeks later when she repeats the words her best friend said minutes after a tornado struck this western Kansas town.
“She called me, and the first question out of her mouth was ‘Are you OK?’ I immediately start complaining about my patio table that got flipped over and just demolished,” Maier said. “Then she kind of choked up and she said, ‘Everything’s gone.’ ”
It was the moment Maier, who lives on a farm south of town, understood the devastation wreaked on her friends and neighbors in Grinnell.
On May 18, an EF-3 tornado swept into the small town of just over 240 people around 6:30 p.m., leveling a west-side neighborhood with more than 28 houses and outbuildings. The elementary school and a city-owned golf course were damaged, along with a Frontier Ag grain facility. 
  Rubble from the May tornado could still be seen on July 9, 2025, in Grinnell. The town has continued cleaning up and making repairs but it will take months to recover. Under tarps in the background, Frontier Ag is storing grain after after its Grinnell facility sustained $5.5 million in damage. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
The National Weather Service reported 13 tornadoes that day in Kansas, six of them rated EF-3, which means winds 136 to 175 mph.
The destruction runs to millions of dollars. But Maier and Grinnell residents tend to focus on the lack of injuries in the stories they tell.
“There were a couple of people who just got beat up,” said Tristan Bixenman, a restaurant owner in nearby Grainfield whose family all lives in the area. “But nobody got seriously injured.”


 
Kansas resilience
Bixenman had been closely watching the weather and canceled a planned family dinner in town when the sky darkened.
“My parents were not very smart, and they were checking ground and happened to come up behind it,” she said, shooting a look at her mother, Christy Rathgeber, who just smiled.

“I was calling them and warning them to go to the basement, because they were in the path of it,” Rathgeber said.
She said she and her husband didn’t realize the storm’s strength until they turned a corner and saw power poles collapsing on the road in front of them.
“That’s when we stopped and backed up,” she said. “There’s so much debris. My husband barely rolled the window down, and it sucked the hat off his head. We’ll never see that hat again.”
Once she realized the tornado was heading to Grinnell, Rathgeber said she contacted family members in the path.
“We called them, and they had no intentions of going to the basement,” she said. “They didn’t think it was anything. Had we not called, I don’t know as if they would have gone to the basement in their house.
“Their house was demolished, but the china hutch was still sitting, and there were still dishes in it,” Rathgeber added.
Kenny Robben also lost his home. In his 80s, Robben had knee surgery and was sitting in his recliner, Bixenman said.
“Sirens are going off, (Robben was) watching the news. Wasn’t too concerned until the last second,” she said. “He stands up with his walker and then the wind just starts coming through his windows. He sits down and literally rides it out in his recliner.”
Bixenman shook her head. Robben was uninjured.
 
Rallying to rebuild
The list of work to be done is long. The local Catholic church lost its roof. Headstones were damaged at the VFW cemetery. The elementary school won’t reopen in time for the start of school.

Contractors are difficult to find, Maier said, but are filtering in to do the work.
A missionary team from the First Baptist Church in Dighton arrived July 21 and framed and sided a house in five days, said the Rev. Ken Bowden.
“We just asked if there was anybody we could help out specifically, and the city nominated one of the families in town to get their house rebuilt,” he said. 
The church team of 20 included a contractor, who helped teach the others, Bowden said. They put walls up the first day, trusses the second and then finished decking it.
The town found a contractor to work on the elementary school, but all classes there are being moved to the middle school when the session starts Aug. 13, Maier said. 
“We’re such a small school, so they’re just going to move some things around and make everybody fit for the year,” she said. “And God bless our lunch lady. She’s going to make the lunches and then hot box them down the street — they have a hot box on wheels — so they get breakfast and lunch. Prior to this, the middle schoolers would come down to eat lunch at the grade school.
“It’s been amazing to see the backbone of people,” Maier added. “Grinnell has some true grit in us. I’m so proud of our little town.”
On July 23, President Donald Trump approved disaster funding for Grinnell and Gove County, along with other Kansas counties affected by the May 18 and 19 storm. Public assistance funding is a cost-sharing federal program to pay for emergency work and repair and replace facilities damaged by storms, said Ryan Lowry-Lee, FEMA Region 7 spokesman.
The assistance will pay for debris removal and emergency protective measures, as well as permanent restoration of facilities such as roads, culverts, bridges and public buildings, he said.
“It’s been a very steep learning curve of what do you do to keep a town safe,” Maier said. “We have two paved roads in town, and everything else is sand road. We might have to dig up these roads, pull up to four inches off them and re-sand them, for safety reasons. Your kids can’t ride a bike if they’re full of nails.”
Maier, who worked in the insurance industry for 13 years, worried the town wouldn’t qualify for support because it had to show $5.8 million of damage to city-owned property. But state and FEMA staff helped her assess damages, and they made the threshold.
Along with damages to the school and the golf course, Maier said 40 water meter pits were damaged or completely gone, costing $1,000 to $1,500 each to replace.
A separate city insurance policy doesn’t cover roads and major infrastructure, and Maier didn’t expect to make the $10,000 deductible. 
Meanwhile, the Grinnell grain facility owned by Frontier Ag will take about $6 million to rebuild, said CEO Stan Remington. They have insurance of $3.5 million to $4 million, he added.
“We lost approximately 750,000 bushels of storage,” he said. “We’ll be lucky to be in operation a year from now. Contractors aren’t easy to find, and it takes time to build that kind of complex back.”
Remington said his company’s other facilities are too far away to be of use for the upcoming fall harvest. The storm damaged storage bins full of grain and forced the company to store wheat under white tents on the ground, a practice they’ll continue. But that drives costs up.
  Darrell Garner, a grain elevator supervisor at Frontier Ag in Grinnell, said the facility lost its storage bins in a tornado in May. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
“Labor costs go up because it takes about two times the labor to put it on the ground,” he said.
Darrell Garner, a grain elevator supervisor at the facility, said they were shut down for about four days after the storm, but welders have been coming in to remove broken metal and make repairs.
“We’re doing pretty good,” he said.
 
So much help
While some residents are rebuilding their houses, others have chosen to sell their lots instead, Maier said.
“I think it’s going to change us forever,” said Lisa Bixenman, a Grinnell resident and a cousin of Tristan Bixenman. “I don’t think a lot of them are going to build back, maybe we’re up to half. I just don’t think it’s ever going to be the same.”
Dolly Theobald’s family chose not to rebuild, but they didn’t leave town. Instead, a local woman offered to sell them her home, and they moved in last week.
The night of the storm, Theobald had just gotten home when her sister-in-law messaged to ask if they were in the basement. After a second call from her mother, Theobald said she gathered her two children and the pets and went to the basement.
“It was crazy loud, and it was probably done in less than 30 seconds,” Theobald said. “You could hear the windows breaking. You could hear debris hit.”
Their house was a total loss. Theobald said she’s grateful her family photos were in a center room in the basement, where they were safe.
Pieces of family history were scattered throughout the area, hung up in trees, and wrapped around jagged edges of aluminum siding. The town set up three tables at the VFW where people put things they found so they could be returned to owners, Rathgeber said.
Concern from small communities poured in through financial donations, boots on the ground, offers of an apartment complex to house people short term and hotels donating free rooms, Maier said.
Volunteers arrived by the hundreds. The day after the tornado, an estimated 1,500 to 1,800 people arrived to clean up, said Grinnell resident Shari Burks.
“Farmers were all supposed to be planting, and they just parked their tractors for a week,” Lisa Bixenman said. “Or they brought them to town to help. I mean, literally it put everybody behind for a week or a week and a half, because they all just dropped everything to come. It’s incredible.”
The VFW, initially the hub of emergency activity and a storm shelter, transitioned to a community center for meals, organizing volunteers, collecting donations and bringing everyone together.
Volunteer Melissa Shupe said donations quickly came from across the country. A semi-truck of new clothing was delivered. People who had been through the Joplin, Missouri, tornado drove in with supplies. Rathgeber, who owns Broken Handle catering, and Tristan Bixenman, who owns Meraki Market, both served dinners.
Nearby restaurants donated hundreds of pizzas and sandwiches, Pepsi donated 400-plus cases of Gatorade and soda, and other companies donated chips and pallets of water, Tristan Bixenman said.
“It was an overwhelming blessing type of thing,” she said. “It can be really challenging to keep all that organized in the aftermath of a disaster. It just kept coming in.”

Long-term recovery
Trish Gruber, Grinnell’s emergency operations manager, said short-term recovery after the storm is over. That included checking for injuries, removing debris and reporting what had happened to appropriate agencies, including utility companies that moved in to clean up downed power lines, she said. 
Gruber also had to address the tornado siren in town that didn’t go off that night. 
The two sirens were tested about 30 minutes before the storm in a regularly scheduled test that occurs every day at noon and 6 p.m., she said.
“It was just when we tried to set it off manually, it was not catching that signal,” Gruber said.
The working siren was located on the west side of town where the tornado hit, Gruber said, adding that emergency vehicles drove through town with their sirens screaming to warn residents.
Today, the siren is fixed, and the long-term recovery, expected to take two years, is underway.
Gruber said the city has applied for a grant to update its tornado shelter. Maier is looking at other grants to help homeowners and the city rebuild.
Sitting on a bench downtown, she is hopeful for Grinnell’s future. 
“It all came together so fast and really, so smoothly,” Maier said of the recovery. “We had an amazing group of people that really stepped up to the plate. As overwhelming as it was, it was a lot of love.”

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right. 


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive.


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”

Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
Why Republican-led states keep leaving a group that verifies voter rolls

‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, says the National Transportation Safety Board hearings on the January midair crash in Washington, D.C., of a commercial jet out of Wichita and a military helicopter based in Virginia revealed failure to address known safety challenges. The accident killed 67 people, including Kansans. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran castigated the Federal Aviation Administration for failing to respond to warning signs and improve safety of airspace in the Washington, D.C., area before American Airlines flight 5342 and an Army Blackhawk helicopter collided in January.
Moran, a Kansas Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, Space and Innovation, said three days of National Transportation Safety Board hearings indicated unresolved staffing issues and a record of near misses were contributing factors in the Jan. 29 accident.
“Despite numerous warning signs of serious problems over the last several years, little was done to try and correct them, and these failures by the FAA, the Army and air traffic control cost 67 lives,” Moran said.
The airliner departed Wichita and fell into the Potomac River after slamming into the helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, known as DCA.
“I know the last few days have been painful for the families of the victims, and I assure them that Congress will not let these failures go unanswered. We cannot undo the tragic loss of life, but we can work to make certain it never happens again,” the senator said.
During the hearings, federal investigators said air traffic controllers responsible for the busy airport were pressured to “make it work.” Former DCA tower operations manager Clark Allen said the system was “pushing the line” on safety.
FAA administrators said the national shortage of traffic controllers had to be considered. On the night of the midair collision, one DCA tower controller was handling both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter traffic. Typically, two controllers divided that workload.
“The NTSB uncovered long-term staffing issues at the control tower that were compounded by a culture of distrust among DCA air traffic controllers and a toleration for unacceptable risks,” Moran said. “It is alarming that FAA failed to act on years of data and near misses indicating serious problems with the design of the mixed airspace around DCA.”
Before the accident, FAA staff said a concern had been raised about Army helicopters taking a route in proximity to commercial jet landings at the airport.
The Army helicopter involved in the collision flew above its ceiling of 200 feet, possibly due to an imprecise altimeter. The impact occurred at 278 feet and killed the three-person helicopter crew as well as 60 passengers, two pilots and two flight attendants on the American Airlines jet.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Moran-on-USAID-3-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-04 09:56:14.122789

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.












I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive




Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
 Undermining ERIC

Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.

A Bay Area lawmaker wants to ban companies from charging prices based on information stored on customers’ phones, laptops or other hardware devices. The bill, which sits before the Assembly after advancing through the Senate in May, is one of the 30 measures the Legislature introduced this year to regulate artificial intelligence technology, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Sen. Aisha Wahab’s proposal would curb AI-powered price discrimination by prohibiting companies from using AI to increase prices based on, say, how much battery life is remaining on a phone, what apps are installed on the device and more.
The Fremont Democrat cites a report by the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog that said that ride-hailing apps charged higher prices to riders whose phone batteries were low. A ProPublica report also found that the test prep company Princeton Review charged higher prices for online SAT tutoring to customers who lived in zip codes where there was a high percentage of Asian residents.

Wahab, during an Assembly committee hearing in July: “Our devices are being weaponized against us in order for large corporations to increase profits, and it has to stop.”

But the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft have denied unfairly manipulating prices. Other business groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce, and some Republican legislators, also oppose the measure.

Assemblymember Diane Dixon, a Newport Beach Republican, at the committee hearing: “This overregulation is impeding how we do business and how people want to do business. I just believe that the market resolves these issues.”

At the urging of President Donald Trump’s advisers, Texas Republicans are attempting to redistrict so that the GOP can maintain its control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026’s midterm elections. 
To help shift the balance of power in the House while sidestepping California’s requirement to bring in an independent commission for redistricting, Newsom is considering calling a special election in November to allow voters to approve an alternative map that would implement more Democratic-leaning districts.

Trump suspends UCLA research grants

The Trump administration is freezing hundreds of science research grants at UCLA due to the U.S. Department of Justice’s findings that the public university did not do enough to stop antisemitism during last year’s pro-Palestine protests.
As CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn explains, nearly 500 National Institutes of Health grants and 300 National Science Foundation grants were suspended. These grants have received $225 million and $170 million, respectively, from the federal government to date, according to Mikhail’s analysis.
The Justice Department found that “Jewish and Israeli students at UCLA were subjected to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment” during the encampment protests. Unless UCLA agrees to a voluntary settlement by Aug. 5., Justice Department officials plan to file a complaint against UCLA in a federal court in September.
In a separate lawsuit, UCLA settled last week with several Jewish plaintiffs over claims that anti-Israel sentiment displayed at the encampments last year violated their religious rights. That settlement, totaling more than $6 million, was slammed by a lawyer representing five pro-Palestinian students and professors, two of whom are Jewish and participated in the encampment.

The Police Records Access Project database, now available to the public, contains roughly 1.5 million pages of records from 12,000 officer-misconduct and use-of-force cases in California.


The public can now search internal affairs documents and other police-misconduct records from nearly 700 California law enforcement agencies through a database created by UC Berkeley and Stanford University. 
The Police Records Access Project database, which contains roughly 1.5 million pages of records from 12,000 officer-misconduct and use-of-force cases, is being jointly published today by CalMatters, The Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and KQED. 
The database is the first of its kind in the nation and will allow the public to search for particular types of misconduct or uses of force. It will also allow police departments to better research potential job candidates and can help researchers identify policing trends.
“The creation of a public facing database is critical for all of the stakeholders in the criminal legal system: whether public defenders, innocence organizations, prosecutors, police departments or academics,” said Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project and a professor at Yeshiva University‘s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. 
Seven years in the making
The database took seven years to produce. It was compiled by journalists, data scientists, lawyers and civil liberties advocates working with the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, UC Berkeley Journalism’s Investigative Reporting Program and Stanford University’s Big Local News. 
The ACLU Foundation of Southern California, California Innocence Coalition, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, UC Irvine law school’s Press Freedom Project and UC Berkeley law school’s Criminal Law & Justice Center also collaborated on the project.
The project began after California legislators approved a series of laws aimed at improving law-enforcement transparency. Senate Bill 1421, approved in 2018, and SB 16, approved in 2021, granted public access to use-of-force and other misconduct records.
However until now, those records were only available by filing a specific request to an individual agency. 
“This living database makes the transparency and accountability aims of SB 1421 a reality,” said Tiffany Bailey, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, which will contribute an additional 200,000 records to the database from its own efforts to obtain public records.
“Critically, families who have lost loved ones in California will now have direct access to the information they need to seek meaningful accountability that has too often been denied.”
The documents in the database were released by law enforcement agencies, district attorneys offices and other organizations and were redacted in compliance with California’s public records laws. The database does not include crime scene photographs, audio recordings or videos.
Police Records Access Project team members further redacted personal information about sexual assault and domestic violence victims. 
The team used emerging technologies such as generative AI to collect, organize and vet the records and build the database.
Money for the project came from the state, with additional funding from the Sony Foundation and Roc Nation.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080125-Police-Database0804_CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

California lawmakers want to ban companies from using data about consumers’ devices like battery life, model and geolocation to set fluctuating prices. Proponents say such “surveillance pricing” is discriminatory.


It’s late at night, and you badly need a ride. Your cellphone’s battery is dangerously low. 
Should a ridehailing company such as Uber or Lyft be able to charge you more because its artificial intelligence programming thinks you’re desperate since it knows your phone is about to die? 
Not if Hayward Democratic Sen. Aisha Wahab has her way.
Her Senate Bill 259 would prevent retailers from using artificial intelligence to jack up prices using the information stored on customers’ phones. That could include the phone’s battery life, whether it’s an older model, what apps are installed, what time of day it is, where its user is located and where they live.
“Our devices are being weaponized against us in order for large corporations to increase profits, and it has to stop,” Wahab told the Assembly Judiciary Committee last month.
Wahab’s bill to limit surveillance pricing that’s coasting through the Legislature is the latest example of California lawmakers trying to reign in the explosion of AI technology this year. Their 29 other legislative proposals this year include a ban on using algorithmic systems to set rent prices and a measure to protect people from automated discrimination by AI models that make critical decisions about a person’s employment, education, housing, health care, finance, criminal sentencing and access to government services. 
Wahab’s measure has been an easier sell than some of the other AI proposals that have already failed thanks, in part, to it being billed as part of Democrats’ post-election pledges to cut costs for Californians.It also has the backing of the state’s influential labor unions, which tend to get their way in the Legislature.Its labor supporters include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the California Labor Federation. In total, those labor groups have donated at least $8.5 million to lawmakers in the last 10 years, according to CalMatters Digital Democracy database.
‘A high-tech assault on working people’
The unions argue that using algorithms and AI to generate higher prices for customers is inherently discriminatory and should be illegal.
Ivan Fernandez, a lobbyist with the California Labor Federation, called the practice of surveillance pricing a “high-tech assault on working people” during a hearing before the Assembly privacy committee in June. He argued that people are already struggling to afford the high cost of living in California, and companies should not be able to “use our data to squeeze every cent they can.”
“Using data such as a person’s geolocation or their phone battery to determine how much to upcharge them for a good or service further exacerbates this issue of affordability for our affiliate members and for workers,” Fernandez said.
On the other side are business and tech groups that also have donated heavily to legislators but tend to get their way less often than labor does.
Opponents include the California Chamber of Commerce and the Silicon Valley lobbying organizations TechNet and Chamber of Progress. The 17 groups opposed to the measure have given at least $11.7 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
The opposition argues that the bill is unnecessary under California’s existing data privacy laws, would stifle innovation, cut into tech company profits and lead to higher prices. 
“The bill would unfairly cause companies to overhaul their pricing models and strategies at significant cost, to the detriment of both the businesses themselves and their consumers,” wrote Ronak Daylami, a policy analyst with CalChamber, in an opposition letter to the Assembly Judiciary Committee. That committee voted 10-4 to send the bill to the Assembly floor.
CalChamber spokesperson John Myers declined to comment further. 
So far, the bill has faced little resistance from lawmakers. Only Republicans have voted against it as it easily passed the California Senate and as it made its way through the Assembly. 
“This overregulation is impeding how we do business and how people want to do business,” said Assemblywoman Diane Dixon, a Republican who represents the Huntington Beach area, during an Assembly judiciary committee hearing. “I just believe that the market resolves these issues.”

A few Democrats, such as assemblymembers Chris Ward of San Diego and Lori Wilson of Suisun City, asked about enforcement and also some exceptions for “legitimate uses” of geolocation data, but Wahab has mostly received kudos.
“It’s modern-day redlining,” Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Democrat who represents the Hayward area, told the Assembly privacy committee, referring to racist lending practices that relegated Black and other non-white families into less safe and less desirable neighborhoods prior to the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Proponents of SB 259 argue that without additional guardrails, companies could use consumers’ data to engage in similarly racist price discrimination. 
“It was not OK then, and it’s not OK today,” Ortega said.Notwithstanding her concerns about equitable pricing, Ortega’s support for the union-sponsored proposal isn’t surprising. She is the former statewide political director for one of AFSCME’s local unions. Since 2023, she voted with AFSCME and its affiliate unions’ positions on legislation 100% of the time in 127 opportunities, according to Digital Democracy. She’s also received $77,800 in campaign donations from AFSCME and its affiliates.
Testing Newsom’s tech loyalty 
As she pitched her proposal, Wahab has frequently referred to herself as “a former tech worker in Silicon Valley” and leaned on her experience working with tech companies as a business IT consultant. Yet she is also strongly aligned with labor and unions, voting their way more than 90% of the time. Since 2021 she has received nearly $50,000 in campaign contributions from the California Labor Federation and AFSCME, according to the Digital Democracy database.
Wahab painted the companies in her former industry as profit-hungry villains that unscrupulously use Californians’ personal data to pad their bottom lines.

Wahab pointed to a ProPublica report that exposed the test prep company Princeton Review charging higher prices for online SAT tutoring to customers in zip codes that had a high percentage of Asian residents, even in neighborhoods with low median incomes. 
“You are being discriminated against based on your perceived socioeconomic status,” Wahab told CalMatters.
She also cited reporting from SFGate that alleged hotel booking platforms would upcharge users whose devices showed they were browsing from the Bay Area, sometimes up to $500 a night more than users in other parts of the country. 
And she highlighted a report from the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog that alleged ridehailing apps such as Uber and Lyft charged higher prices to riders whose phone batteries were low – a claim that the companies deny.
“Suggestions that our systems manipulate pricing unfairly or discriminate are simply false and not supported by evidence,” wrote Zahid Arab, a spokesperson for Uber, in an emailed statement. Shadawn Reddick-Smith, a representative for Lyft, said in an emailed statement that the company “does not base fares on battery percentage.”
At least one expert on tech says the critiques from business groups that the bill would stifle innovation and lead to profit losses are inaccurate, specious and “wildly overblown.” 
“Industries have built a business model around systematically violating our privacy in ways that we do not want, and generally do not consent to,” said David Evan Harris, a former research manager at Meta and a lecturer at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. “People shouldn’t have to be misled into consenting to things.”
Robert Boykin, a representative for the trade group TechNet, noted that California’s privacy law already gives consumers “meaningful rights,” such as the ability to opt out of the sale of precise geolocation and protection from discrimination should they choose to do so. 
He said the law also allows companies to offer customers “benefits like loyalty programs and pricing discounts, as long as they’re tied to the value of the data and meet strict standards.” 
Wahab’s measure is likely to be heard by the full Assembly when lawmakers reconvene from their summer recess in mid-August. It could end up on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk soon after. 
The governor has a friendlier relationship with tech companies than the Legislature does. Last year, Newsom vetoed a handful of bills that sought to regulate AI. They included bans on self-driving trucks and weaponized robots as well as a comprehensive measure compelling testing of AI models. 
In July, Newsom convened a panel of California tech executives to identify inefficiencies in state government operations, a nod to Trump’s deployment of Tesla CEO Elon Musk to remake the federal bureaucracy. He reportedly even sent “burner” phones to nearly 100 tech executives so they could contact him confidentially.

Monica Rivera
Monica Rivera is a real estate sales manager and serves as chair of the Gateway Cities chapter of Abundant Housing LA.


Working families across California are getting pushed further away from opportunity — from cities and job centers with schools, health care facilities and amenities. Nowhere is this more evident than where I live, Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest metro area and one of the wealthiest regions in the world.
Thousands of Angelenos are stuck with costly, exhausting commutes because they can’t afford to live near their jobs, burning through more than $14,000 a year on transportation — much of it on car payments, gas and maintenance. This isn’t an accident. For decades, our cities have systematically banned apartments and condos, preventing working people from living near jobs and transit systems their taxes fund.
The solution is simple: reform land use and housing policies to allow more homes near transit.
I’ve spent my career helping people find homes — not just for the right square footage, but for homes that allow them to connect the rest of their lives. As a real estate sales manager, I’ve supported agents through over 1,000 home sales and seen the same struggle play out: families who want to live close to their jobs, childcare or aging parents — and can’t.
In L.A. County, families earning the median income of $88,000 can’t afford sky-high rent, much less a median home price approaching $1 million. They move farther out, sacrificing time, money and quality of life to keep a roof over their heads.
Meanwhile, taxpayers have spent billions expanding our transit network, adding stations in places like South Pasadena, Redondo Beach and East Long Beach. Yet red tape blocks housing near these stops, making it nearly impossible for working families to live near the infrastructure they’ve already paid for.
A bill in the state legislature, SB 79, offers a commonsense fix: requiring cities to allow more housing near transit — up to seven stories near subways and mid-rises near less frequent Metrolink stops. Projects that meet these standards would be streamlined for approval.
This approach puts money back in peoples’ pockets. Families not reliant on cars save thousands yearly, which is often the difference between barely getting by and putting money towards their dreams — a college education for their kids, a retirement plan or even a GED or vocational certificate to change their career path.
My nieces are a clear example of what’s at stake. My 19-year-old niece would wake at 3 a.m. to walk to the bus stop, transferring across four buses to make it to her 7 a.m. class at Rio Hondo College, often on little sleep. Her younger sister, working toward her degree at Cal State Long Beach, was balancing a part time job to afford $50-$60 each way on rideshares because of the lack of reliable transit near home.
We don’t always call this displacement, but that’s what it is. They weren’t just priced out of housing — they were nearly priced out of access to education, work and opportunity.
More homes near transit reduces the risk of displacement. California’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office found that Bay Area neighborhoods adding the most housing experienced half the displacement rates of areas that blocked development.
It’s also critical for climate action. Cars and trucks account for 30% of the state’s climate pollution, a figure that remains stubbornly high because so many Californians are forced to drive long distances. Research shows people who live near reliable transit or in walkable neighborhoods, drive half as much as those in car-dependent areas, reducing traffic, commute times and air pollution.
I’m old enough to remember when teachers lived near schools and nurses near hospitals. That didn’t change because of their preferences — it changed because we banned the housing they could afford.
We’ve let perfect become the enemy of good, and working families pay the price. SB 79 is a step toward fairness: it lets people live near the infrastructure we’ve already built, and ensures good housing doesn’t die in endless meetings.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/041320-LA-Metro-Train-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

A request by Musk’s company to operate while the application is pending was denied by then-Nevada Transportation Commissioner David Groover, who was removed from his appointed position last month, according to sources. 
The effort by Paradise Transportation Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Musk’s Boring Company, is intended to let Vegas Loop, a project that could take decades to complete, take immediate advantage of traffic at Harry Reid International Airport. 
Thanks to Musk’s deep pockets, the above-ground service seeks to undercut competition with fares other modes of transportation can’t match: $5 for trips up to three miles, $10 for four to six miles, and $12 for trips of more than six miles.
While rideshare rates vary, a two-mile Lyft ride runs about $11 while a 13-mile trip is roughly $23, both about twice as much as Paradise’s proposed fare. Taxis charge a base fee of $3.50 plus about $2.75 per mile, according to the Taxicab Authority.  
Musk’s application says there is “currently a gap in the market and no regular transportation servicer between the Harry Reid International Airport (and other resorts) and the Vegas Loop,” as well “a gap in service to properties with approved entitlements for Vegas Loop stations.” 
Paradise is seeking licenses to transport passengers “between definite points of origin and destination, at a per capita rate,” according to state regulation. Whether the points of origin and destination are confined to the airport, resorts, or any of 104 tunnel stations approved by local governments, as outlined in the application to provide service, and whether the stations would have to be operational, are points of contention, according to insiders. 
“Our only concern is that they get properly licensed,” said Jonathan Schwartz, Director of Yellow Checker Star Transportation (YCS) and Newcab, whose companies collectively put about half of the cabs in Southern Nevada on the streets. “They’re essentially operating a taxicab company, and they need to be licensed and permitted as such. They need to charge a compensable rate.”
Industry insiders, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation, say Musk is willing to lose money by undercutting competitors and potentially putting them out of business in order to prove his underground transit concept works.
An initial, heavily-redacted application filed by Paradise with the Nevada Transportation Authority (NTA) in September 2024, attempted to conceal from the public the project’s connection to the Vegas Loop. A revised version filed two months later revealed the relationship between Musk’s Boring Company and Paradise, its subsidiary. 
Groover, the former state transportation commissioner, approved a bid from Musk’s company in April for interim authority to shuttle passengers on surface streets between the airport and 4744 Paradise Road (a proposed Vegas Loop station that has yet to be built) while the application is pending, but denied the company’s interim request to provide transportation for special events, according to a document obtained by the Current.
Groover confirmed Friday he is no longer with the NTA, and as the former hearing master in an ongoing case, declined to comment.
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who appointed Groover to the NTA, did not respond to requests for comment.
Paradise has not complied with NTA requirements and interim authority for airport transit has not been issued, NTA official Liz Babcock said via email.
The airport is the holy grail for the Vegas Loop. It’s the reason Strip properties are eager to set aside valuable property for Loop stations. But unlike pliant local officials, who have largely allowed Musk’s Boring Company to tunnel without impediment, the Federal Aviation Administration and federal environmental reviews stand between the proposed airport tunnel and some 58 million passengers a year.
‘Soul-destroying traffic’
Steve Hill, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, has hailed going underground as a means of alleviating traffic congestion since 2019, when the LVCVA granted Musk’s Boring Company a $52.5 million contract to connect its expanding convention facility via tunnels. Hill also planted the seeds for expanding the labyrinth to run beneath Strip and downtown casinos, with Musk footing the bill and collecting the revenue.
“This project is exceptionally important to Las Vegas. It’s really an opportunity to make a dent in traffic congestion,” Hill said in a 2024 LVCVA news release. 
Boring Co. wants Vegas Loop expansion

Now, traffic concerns are taking a back seat to accelerating Boring’s plans to augment ridership at its only publicly operating project in the U.S. The Vegas Loop currently moves more than 30,000 passengers per day across five stations and 2.2 miles of tunnel, the company says. When fully constructed, daily ridership is expected to reach 90,000.
“It’s not going to be a transportation system that they rely on,” Hill said during a phone interview of the surface street version of the Vegas Loop. “It’s just intended to provide them some flexibility while the system’s being built. They’ll stay in the tunnels to the extent they are available. This just gives them some options in the event that they are not complete.” 
It took Boring one year to dig 1.7 miles for two convention center tunnels. At that rate, it could take 40 years to complete the entire 68-mile system and 104 stations. 
“There is no way mathematically that this could be the kind of grand solution to a city’s transportation problems that they’re pitching,” Jarrett Walker, an international public transit planning consultant told Bloomberg in a story published last week.
Even Boring’s employees, according to Bloomberg, are feeling frustrated working “on a downgraded mission to develop an underground taxi network in Sin City.
Hill says only about 15 to 20 of the 104 locations approved by local governments for tunnel stations have agreements with Boring. “It’s not the kind of thing you do until you are ready to build,” he said. 
The NTA declined to comment on whether Paradise’s lack of entitlement to all station locations would affect the application.
The company and its subsidiary, Paradise, did not respond to requests for an interview.  
“The Boring Company just doesn’t talk,” said Hill. “It’s not you, it’s everybody”
Cars, taxis, and tunnels
The LVCVA’s 2019 deal with Boring came as the Regional Transportation Commission coped with rideshare-induced cuts to bus revenue along the Strip, once its bread-and-butter route.
“We certainly don’t feel the Boring Company’s system in the community would be exclusive or crowd out others,” Hill said at the time.
Paradise’s application notes the company “is providing affordable point-to-point transportation service to supplement existing transportation in Las Vegas and meet the expected growing demand for these services.” But common carriers fear Musk’s endeavor will supplant, rather than supplement, existing services. 
“It’s going to put me out of business,” said a Lyft driver, who noted ridership is down and driver earnings, determined by the platform’s algorithm, are on the decline.  
Visitation to Las Vegas was off by more than 11% in June, according to the LVCVA. 
“If they’re going to operate as a taxicab company, they should be licensed as a taxicab company,” Schwartz says of the entire Vegas Loop, above and below ground. “They’re operating cars. It’s not a rail. They’re just operating cars through a tunnel. It’s no different than a taxicab.”
The company’s projections for ridership, revenue, and expenses are redacted in its application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the NTA. 
Hill contends the NTA intends to regulate the above-ground Loop as a Transportation Network Company (TNC), the same designation as a rideshare. The NTA, however, says the above-ground Loop would operate as a special service and airport transfer service.
Hiil acknowledges the Vegas Loop “is competitive with taxis and rideshares, but the vast majority of what they’re going to do is in the tunnels.” He says it’s up to the NTA to determine whether the Loop’s above-ground component will pose too much competition to taxis and rideshares. 
Nevada law permits the NTA to grant a CPCN if, in addition to other requirements, the applicant is financially viable and the approval “will foster sound economic conditions within the applicable industry” and “will not unreasonably and adversely affect other carriers operating in the territory.”
“The reason we have the statute that says these companies need to be financially viable is so you don’t have a business model where you build it out, use pricing power like that, and then you’re the only game in town,’ said the industry insider who asked not to be identified. “Musk can undercut everybody for as long as he wants. He’s financially viable. But does the business model work?”
An NTA spokesperson says the state is mostly concerned with the applicant’s “fitness to operate within the regulatory framework.” Interested parties can file a petition to intervene regarding the applicant’s impact on the market. 
“We do not do market impact studies,” NTA attorney Yoneet Wilburn said via email. “We do not have studies on the financial impact.”
Musk has long hailed tunneling as the answer to the “soul-destroying traffic” in metropolitan areas. 
Several industry experts suggest that If reducing traffic congestion is the true purpose of the tunnels, Boring Company should allow all electric vehicles to use them. 
“That’s silly,” Hill said in response to the suggestion. “The Boring Company built the tunnels. They own them. Whoever has that idea has a misunderstanding of how that works.”
Clark County and the City of Las Vegas, Hill noted, have revenue sharing agreements with Vegas Loop. 
But toll roads are popular in a number of states, including California. Boring, experts say, could easily impose a toll tunnel on unaffiliated drivers, with local governments getting a cut of the action.    
The city and Clark County have franchise agreements with TBC that entitle the governments to revenue from rides originating in their jurisdictions. Clark County receives .5% of quarterly gross revenue up to $17.5 million and 5% of gross revenue in excess of that amount. The city has a similar agreement. 
Public transportation experts suggest Paradise’s application is a fait accompli and is likely to be approved by the NTA, which some suggest is subject to regulatory capture. 
Musk enjoys unofficial “favorite son” status in Nevada, where his Tesla Corporation is reaping the benefits of more than $1.6 billion in tax breaks. Hill shepherded the initial portion of that deal in his former job as executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, where he worked with Kris Sanchez, director of the state’s Department of Business and Industry, which oversees the NTA. 
Boring again did not respond to requests for comment. 
“I notified the attorney for Paradise Transportation yesterday that you requested the applications,” NTA attorney Wilburn said Wednesday, adding that doing so is her personal practice. Asked if she’d notify the attorney that the Current is trying to get in touch, Wilburn declined. “I’d never do that.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/newvloc.webp,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

With a portion of a new election law now effective, clerks will have less time to receive mail-in ballots. But, those planning to vote in advance can still cast their votes in various methods.
Every county — except for Daggett, Grand, Morgan, Piute, Rich and Uintah — have at least one primary race for mayors offices and city councils happening on Aug. 12, according to the Utah Lt. Governor’s Office. Utah County residents are also electing candidates for school board.

“A lot of these people that we’re electing at the local level are making decisions on things like roads, parks, schools in some cases, and zoning, and permits, and libraries, and police and fire, and setting your tax rates and fees,” Cambria Cantrell, elections coordinator at the lieutenant governor’s office said. “So local elections matter as much as, if not, sometimes more than any other.”
The deadline to register to receive a by-mail ballot has passed. However, voters can still send in their ballots by mail. Unlike other elections, there isn’t a specific last day to postmark a ballot, but Cantrell warns, voters should send them in as soon as possible.
That’s because a phase of HB300, an election law the Utah Legislature passed this year, now requires clerks to receive any votes sent by mail by 8 p.m. on election night. 
“We are encouraging people, if they plan to mail their ballot, to do it early, just to allow plenty of time for it to get through the Postal Service system,” Cantrell said.
Dropboxes in every city across the state are also a good option to submit the ballots that may not make it on time in the mail. 



Let us know what you think...


 


This is also the first election under HB69, a 2025 law banning clerks from accessing and disclosing voter records for personal purposes.
Utahns may also notice a change in their ballot envelope design. Utah County and other jurisdictions that hadn’t made the change yet implemented privacy tabs to prevent individual ballots from being traced back to voters’ personal information. 
In another change, while it isn’t required yet, some counties started adding a spot where voters can provide the last four digits of their social security or driver’s license numbers for verification, a phase of HB300 that will officially become effective statewide in 2029.
Voters who are registered to vote but haven’t received their ballots in their mail have until Tuesday, Aug. 5, to request one, Cantrell said. The deadline for voters using the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act is Aug. 11. 
Same-day registration is also available for those voting in person. Voters may visit the state’s election website to read more about the candidates running for public office in their cities. Early voting times vary depending on the county. 
Municipal primaries like these are generally less popular among voters. Turnout in most counties is often in the 20% to 30% range, Cantrell said. That’s a little lower than turnout in primary elections for statewide offices, which last year was in the 46% to 47% range.
Because some races lack candidates in opposing parties, meaning offices will be decided in party primaries, state election officials encourage Utahns to participate.

(Left: Courtesy Cindy Myrex; Right: Courtesy Clint Hollingsworth)Republican voters in Cullman County will choose their nominee for the House District 12 special election for the Alabama House of Representatives on Aug. 12.
Voters narrowed their options from four candidates to Cullman City Councilman Clint Hollingsworth and realtor Cindy Myrex on July 15. Myrex received 49.81% of votes and Hollingsworth got 43.24%, according to election results. 
The district covers part of Cullman County and is solidly Republican. Former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. He resigned in April after not being present for much of the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions.

The candidates

Hollingsworth, 47, said he is trying to get to places that he did not make it to before the July primary.
“I just try to get in front of as many people as I can possible,” Hollingsworth said in a phone interview Tuesday.
Myrex said she is prioritizing spending personal time with voters to listen to their concerns and accurately represent them.
“I just feel like I’m more in tune with the people,” Myrex said in a phone interview Thursday. “It’s about being a strong conservative voice in Montgomery, for our county, and represent the voice of the people and what they want.”
Both candidates have a long list of priorities and ideas if they are elected to office, most of which stem from community concerns. Hollingsworth, who has served on the Cullman City Council for 17 years, said a lot of concerns he hears are local.
“You go to different areas and some people were wanting a traffic light. Some people are wanting road work done,” Hollingsworth said. “I’ve got one place that needs an AC for their volunteer fire department.”
Myrex, a Smith Lake realtor, has heard similar concerns, but is prioritizing being a strong voice in the state legislature and reducing government overreach. 
“My priority is always going to be to be the voice of the people. I don’t know that you can prioritize this many needs,” she said.
Myrex said Friday that voters are concerned about some land on Smith Lake in Cullman County that will be annexed to the City of Cullman, a result of SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills.
“The bigger topic has been the annexation of Smith Lake property into the City of Cullman, and the fact that Poarch Creek Indians owns a portion of that property. And their concern is, could there be gambling, a casino, or whatever on Smith Lake,” Myrex said. “So that’s been more of the issue is, ‘Please work hard to keep that out of our community, and please work hard to stop the any kind of annexation.'”
An amendment in the bill’s final version prohibits building a casino or another place for gambling activities.
In the primary, 4,274 people voted, 12.4% of registered voters, according to results. Myrex is expecting most of those to return for the primary runoff. 
“When I say, exercise your right, I don’t care what side of the aisle you’re on,” Myrex said. “That’s your voice when you mark that box.”
The Cullman Tribune, a local news outlet, plans to host a debate on Aug. 9 at Wallace State Community College. Myrex said she would not attend, but would not say on-the-record why.

Campaign Finances

More than $270,000 have been raised in the primary race, according to campaign finance records. Hollingsworth has raised $147,741.73 since the beginning of his campaign and spent $112,301.75. Almost two thirds of his donations come from political action committees (PACs), where the SV&B and SVBII PACs donated the most at $14,000 between two separate PACs that are operated by the same consulting firm: Swatek, Vaughn and Bryan.
PACs donated $89,483.75 (60.6%), individuals gave $42,719.64 (28.9%) and businesses gave $13,750 (9.3%), according to campaign finance records. A message seeking comment from Hollingsworth about his donations was left Friday.
Myrex has raised $142,302.20 since the beginning of her campaign and spent $111,395.21. Myrex has self funded almost 40% of her campaign with more than $56,000. Businesses have contributed $42,000 (29.5%), individuals have given $35,726 (25.1%) and PACs have given $6,600 (4.6%), according to campaign finance records. The Veterans PAC and the fundraising arm of ALFA contributed a combined $6,100 and the Alabama Christian Citizens PAC gave the other $500.
Myrex said in a phone interview Friday that she wished she had gotten more support from PACs, but is glad that the voters are funding her campaign more.
“To be honest, I’m not the chosen one. I’m not the Montgomery pick,” Myrex said. “I’m thankful that my community has rallied around me and believe enough in me and donated for the win, because that tells me that my community believes in me.”

How to vote

District 12 voters can choose between Hollingsworth and Myrex for the Republican nomination on Aug. 12. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here. The winner will face Democratic nominee Matthew Glover, a 40-year-old former Good Hope City councilman on Oct. 28.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A longtime Alaska fisher who was sentenced in May to a year in jail for illegally exporting crab, much of it disease infected, has now been ordered to pay $1.18 million in penalties for unrelated water pollution charges.
Corey Potter and the companies he managed  — the vessel Knot EZ, Aleutian Tendering LLC and the Alaska Tendering Company LLC — were ordered to pay the combined penalty in a default judgment issued on Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason.
The penalty was for repeated discharges of oily bilge water, which violated the Clean Water Act, according to court documents.
Potter had not responded to the charges, which were detailed in a complaint filed on Oct. 24, or appeared in court on the case, according to the U.S. Coast Guard and federal prosecutors. That triggered the default judgment by Gleason.
Potter’s previous case concerned thousands of pounds of king crab he and his partners harvested in Southeast Alaska and took directly to Washington state. Alaska law requires that all crabs commercially harvested in waters off Alaska be landed and processed within the state. Part of the reason for that is to ensure quality and marketability.
 

  The Knot EZ, seen in this undated photo, had been illegally discharging oily bilge water over multiple fishing seasons, federal prosecutors said. The vessel operated as a tender, delivering harvested fish from catcher vessels to processors. It was owned by Corey Potter, a longtime Alaska fisher sentenced in May to jail time for illegal out-of-state shipment of king crab, much of which was infected with bitter crab syndrome.

	Instead, a significant percentage of the catch that Potter and his associate brought to Washington state was infected with bitter crab syndrome. The parasitic disease, which is linked to warming waters, kills crabs and makes their meat unpalatable, though not toxic to humans.
The water pollution case against Potter is separate. It stems from a Coast Guard rescue of the Knot EZ, which was sinking in Kodiak Harbor in July of 2022. The Knot EZ operated as a tender, a vessel that delivered fish from harvesters to processors, according to court documents.
Guardsmen who responded to the Knot EZ’s distress call discovered that the vessel had an illegal discharge system that was pumping oily bilge water directly into the sea, according to the complaint. Crew members hired by Potter admitted that the illegal bypass system was used daily, according to the complaint.
The vessel was declared to be unfit for service, and subsequent investigation discovered a long-running pattern of such violations in past fishing seasons as well, according to the complaint.
While neither Potter nor his companies responded to the Clean Water Act charges, a public defender representing him in the crab case asked for leniency, based on his age and on the financial hardships he has already endured. Potter, 64, “has been reduced to relying upon family for assistance and has no viable means to support himself,” said the defense presentencing memorandum in that case, which was filed on May 6.

Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) is shown on the floor of the New Mexico Senate during the 2025 legislative session. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A state senator wants New Mexico to adopt a more rehabilitative model for incarcerating and treating young people who are accused of crimes and whom the state deems in need of mental health treatment.
As young people await trial in their delinquent or criminal cases, New Mexico holds them in four county-run youth detention centers in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Farmington and Roswell.
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) told the Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee on Wednesday this leaves communities in northeastern New Mexico, including her district, without any youth detention centers. As a result, the county transports children from Santa Fe who are charged with crimes all the way to Farmington, she said.
“It’s so far away for our families, and it’s just not good for them to be so far away,” Trujillo said. “I think that we, as a state, should take responsibility for ensuring that we have detention centers that meet a standard and that provide the resources that we need to, and that are local and in our communities.”
The problem is statewide, according to Fifth Judicial District Attorney Dianna Luce and Law Offices of the Public Defender Deputy Chief of Operations Jennifer Barela, who discussed juvenile justice and treatment with the committee on Thursday.
Luce and Barela told the committee it’s difficult if not impossible to place children facing criminal charges into mental health treatment. Barela said public defenders who represent children in courts across the state tell her there’s nowhere to place young people for treatment.
“We need to look at more localized treatment,” Barela said. “These kids need to be close to their families.”
Trujillo said she wants to see the state government start building small, non-institutional youth detention facilities close to home. She said she wants a system inspired by the state of Missouri’s Division of Youth Services, which she called a national model and said considers not only a young person’s alleged crime but also their treatment needs.
New Mexico’s own child welfare agency, the Children Youth and Families Department, hired a contractor to implement the Missouri model in 2007, according to Trujillo’s presentation to the committee.
State officials in 2010 adopted a plan to implement the Missouri model which included creating regional youth detention centers, according to Trujillo’s presentation, however, she said counties still haven’t built the facilities because they can’t afford to.
After courts resolve young people’s cases, CYFD provides mental health treatment to girls and boys held in the Youth Development and Diagnostic Center in Albuquerque and boys in the John Paul Taylor Center in Las Cruces, if they meet the criteria to get in, Luce said.
“I’m proposing that we have more of those, and that they look more like a home,” Trujillo told Source NM in an interview on Friday. “It’s not just to detain youth — it’s to provide them intense therapy, to provide them the resources they need.”
The facilities Trujillo is proposing would have the same security measures any detention center would, but would hold smaller numbers of children and be built to not “look so institutional.”
Trujillo’s two proposals are part of a larger package of juvenile justice reforms she wants Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to consider in the 30-day legislative session next year.

Federal officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management held one of their first public meetings on the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport Wednesday– a project nearly three-decades in the making.
The airport would be one of the largest in the nation by land area, sprawling across 23,000 acres of public land in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm. 
Nearly a hundred people attended the meeting to provide public comments on the proposed airport – input that will help guide the federal government as they work through the environmental review process. 
That review will likely center on the airport’s potential impact on two endangered species who call the area home: the desert tortoise and the white-margined penstemon, a small pink bell-shaped flower.

Early maps of the project show that desert tortoises will likely need to be relocated to accommodate the construction of the airport. However, recent studies have suggested that relocating desert tortoises can be detrimental to their survival.
One long-term study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that in the first three years of relocating 158 desert tortoises less than 10 miles from their habitat about 50% died, mostly due to predators.
The airport would also encroach on one of the sole known populations of the white-margined penstemon. A 2021 study commissioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found a 50% chance of extinction for the wildflower in the next 50 years due to climate change and habitat destruction.
The Center for Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter held a press conference outside the meeting to speak on the airport’s potential impact on desert habitat and wildlife.
“If we destroy our desert for sprawl, we will end up harming our ecosystems, harming our air quality, diminishing our water supplies, and affecting people here in Las Vegas very substantially,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity.
Critics of the project said the airport was a sign of reckless sprawl in Southern Nevada, a region experiencing severe long-term drought. 
State officials have suggested the new airport could lead to further development. In 2023, state lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Bill 19 which would allow Clark County to put aside at least 5,000 acres for a new commercial and residential development in the vicinity of the new airport.
“We cannot afford to sprawl all the way down to Jean. We cannot afford the wildlife impacts or the water impacts or the air quality impacts from adding a second gigantic commercial airport,” said Vinny Spotleson, the president of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter.
Several locals who spoke at the meeting questioned the need for a second airport, noting the development of high-speed rail between Nevada and California, and the presence of several other airports in southern Nevada that could be expanded to meet demand.
James Chrisley, the senior director for the Clark County Department of Aviation, said the Harry Reid International Airport will not be able to keep up with projected demand for air travel without the Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport. 
According to estimates by the agency, the Harry Reid International Airport will reach its full capacity of 63 million to 65 million passengers annually by 2030. The airport would accommodate both passenger and cargo flights.
Decades-old decisions have also left the county with limited options when it comes to the location of an additional airport.
“We’re landlocked,” Chrisley said. 
The Harry Reid Airport was initially built in 1942 outside the city of Las Vegas, in a relatively undeveloped area. However, the rapid growth of the Las Vegas metropolitan area over subsequent decades led to the city’s suburbs surrounding the airport, effectively landlocking it.
The Clark County Department of Aviation has evaluated several locations and looked into potentially modifying smaller airports to meet their needs, but concluded Ivanpah Valley was the only feasible option.
More than a dozen sites were evaluated by 2005 as potential locations for the airport before being whittled down to four: Apex, Eldorado Valley, Moapa Reservation, and Ivanpah Valley.
Nellis Air Force Base, Moapa Reservation, and Apex were eventually eliminated due to airspace constraints. Between Eldorado Valley and Ivanpah Valley, the latter won out.
“We’ve revalidated that study recently and continue to look at it just to make sure this is truly the only feasible site,” Chrisley said.
Plans for the airport were first initiated in 2000 when the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Act, championed by U.S. Senator Harry Reid and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, transferred about 6,000 acres of public land to Clark County for a new airport.
The Clark County Department of Aviation submitted their first draft by 2006, but local economic conditions following the Great Recession and other local budgetary constraints stalled the project for decades. In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the federal government to suspend any work on the environmental review.
Chrisley said things changed this year after the Harry Reid International Airport recorded 58.4 million passengers last year, a 1.39% increase over 2023’s previous high.
“We’ve been planning this for 25 years, and I personally have been on this for the last almost 10 years. It’s time. The Valley continues to grow and we need to support the innovation of this community,” Chrisley said.
Preliminary plans show the airport would include a central terminal, two runways, a taxiway system, and an air traffic control tower. The plan would also require an expansion of the Interstate-15 and a new dedicated interchange.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airport-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A horrific crime leads to get-tough policies to ensure the tragedy never happens again.
That happened in 2018, after a failure in Alabama’s criminal justice system led to the mistaken parole of a man who later murdered three people, including a 7-year-old child, during a series of robberies in Guntersville.
Gov. Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall called for major changes to the parole system. Lawmakers delivered. The Board of Pardons and Paroles was soon staffed by people largely skeptical of inmates.
As a result, parole rates plummeted into the single digits. Incarcerated people who made earnest rehabilitation efforts remained trapped in a system racked by violence, which made enrollment in training programs behind bars seem pointless, adding to the chaos. The board made dozens of cruel and ridiculous decisions, including, per al.com, denying parole to a quadriplegic man. State officials now seem to be backing away from the approach.
Today we have another horrific crime that, I fear, may lead legislators acting in good faith to enact policies that could have terrible unintended consequences.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, a former prosecutor of child abuse cases, is reintroducing a bill he filed last year to impose the death penalty on those convicted of sexual assault of children younger than 12.
In support of the legislation, Simpson and his supporters are citing what can only be described as an atrocity in Bibb County. Authorities have charged seven people with running a child sex trafficking ring involving victims ranging from ages 3 to 15.
The details are hard to process. Anyone convicted of these crimes needs to be locked away and never wander outside a prison wall again. And believe me, I understand the desire to go even further and subject people who commit these evil acts to the most severe punishments we can imagine.
But extending the death penalty in this manner is a bad idea. Not because it would be bad for the abusers. Because it would be bad for the victims.
Simpson and his supporters want to overturn a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Kennedy v. Louisiana, which prohibited capital punishment for child rape. In that case, the court voted 5-4 to overturn the death sentence of a Louisiana man who had been convicted of brutally raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. This Supreme Court may do what Simpson hopes.
But they should pause before taking that step. In his majority opinion in Kennedy v. Louisiana, Justice Anthony Kennedy made sure to convey the horror of the crime. But he also noted that pursuing the death penalty meant the traumatized victim, a child, had to discuss her ordeal at length — first with law enforcement, and then at a public trial.
“Capital cases require a long-term commitment by those who testify for the prosecution, especially when guilt and sentencing determinations are in multiple proceedings,” Justice Kennedy wrote. “In cases like this, the key testimony is not just from the family but from the victim herself. During formative years of her adolescence, made all the more daunting for having to come to terms with the brutality of her experience, (the victim) was required to discuss the case at length with law enforcement personnel.”
Kennedy also noted concerns raised by social worker organizations. Child abuse is already an underreported crime, in part because people fear the repercussions for a family member so charged. Imposing the death penalty for child assault could further suppress reporting. Even worse, the justice wrote, making abuse a capital crime “may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill the victim.”
And then there’s the fact that the death penalty is not a deterrent. Alabama has accelerated capital punishment in recent years. Six people died in the Atmore death chamber in 2024, the most in the country.
Despite that, Alabama has nation-leading rates of homicide. In 2022, over 700 Alabamians died at someone else’s hands, a rate of 14.9 per 100,000, the fourth-highest in the country. This isn’t a fluke, either. Since 2014, Alabama has been one of the top-five states in the country for homicide deaths every single year.
Some people may see all this and decide that whatever the consequences, a crime like this can only end in death.
“If it sends even one child predator to an early grave, well, that works too,” Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, said at a Thursday press conference.
It could do that. But only decades after the original crime. And following rounds of appeals where the victim may be forced to relive that horror, over and over again.  While potentially discouraging reports of other assaults.
Is it worth subjecting the victim to that trauma? Is it worth risking a further decline in child abuse reporting? Or putting victims in potentially greater danger?
Anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a child needs to be locked away for life.
But we can’t let our outrage take precedence over the welfare of the victims. If we do, there may be terrible outcomes we don’t intend and never see.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250731_1606042462-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.

Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.










It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.

After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

Mace has officially announced her run for governor in 2026. (File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District became the fifth GOP candidate to enter the 2026 governor’s race Monday.
Mace, the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, officially launched her campaign during an early morning event at her alma mater. She has been teasing an impending bid for months on social media and talking to voters across the state to prepare for a launch.
“I’m running for governor because South Carolina doesn’t need another empty suit,” Mace told supporters. “I’ve walked into firestorms and come out swinging. … I came to draw the line today and hold it.”
Mace joins an already crowded field for the primary. Republicans who have already announced bids over the last month are Attorney General Alan Wilson, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, and most recently, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of Rock Hill.
Attacks and accusations
While the 47-year-old single mother only just made it official, she has been sniping at the competition, both on social media and in front of voters.
Mace has taken shots at Evette as a “glorified ribbon cutter” who only smiles and waves.
“She’s a nice lady,” Mace wrote on social media in June. “No edge. No guts. No shot.”
But Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as South Carolina’s top prosecutor, has been the primary focus of Mace’s criticism. At the start of the year she began calling Wilson a “do-nothing attorney general.”
Then in February, Mace took to the House floor and accused four men, including her ex-fiancé, of “some of the most heinous crimes against women imaginable” during a nearly hour-long prepared speech.
Mace accuses 4 men, including ex-fiancé, of being sexual ‘predators.’ SLED is investigating.

The congresswoman said she discovered thousands of photos taken with hidden cameras as well as recordings the “predators” made of themselves sexually assaulting women over years. She was among the victims.
The State Law Enforcement Division confirmed after her speech that it was investigating at least one of the men for assault, harassment and voyeurism. The investigation started Dec. 14, 2023, after SLED was contacted by U.S. Capitol Police.
Mace also accused Wilson of not addressing the crimes against her and other women.
All four men accused have denied the accusations and one has sued for libel and defamation.
Wilson said neither he nor anyone in his office had any knowledge of the accusations until her speech. It also is not the attorney general’s job to start a police investigation, his office said in a statement.
Since then, Mace has sued one of the other men for defamation. And a woman, identified as Jane Doe, who says she was a victim of three of the men has filed her own civil suit.
All of those lawsuits are ongoing.
Mace’s political career
Mace’s political career began in January 2018 when she won a special election to the South Carolina House representing parts of Charleston and Berkeley counties. She replaced a GOP legislator who resigned amid a yearslong Statehouse corruption investigation.
In 2020, Mace ousted one-term Democrat Joe Cunningham for the 1st congressional seat, flipping the district back into Republican control. The district was then redrawn as part of the Legislature’s redistricting process following the 2020 census to favor a Republican and Mace easily won re-election with more than 58% of the vote.

Mace won her last GOP primary with the endorsement of President Donald Trump. But during her early days in Congress, the two had a rocky relationship.
Mace condemned Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol and was among House Republicans who voted to impeach him in the aftermath. In her first re-election bid, Trump backed her GOP challenger, though Mace ultimately won that primary.
She’s since become one of Trump’s most fervent allies.
“I think that anyone that wants to run statewide or any election, really, in 2026 or 2028 beyond, will need the President’s support,” Mace previously told reporters.
More controversy
Mace has also made headlines for her conflicts with multiple transgender people.
It began with the election last November of Delaware’s Rep. Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress. Mace introduced a resolution to ban transgender women from using women’s restrooms in the U.S. Capitol and House office buildings, later seeking to expand that to all federal property.
Congresswoman Mace doubles down on offensive language to transgender USC student

She was then criticized for using a slur to the LGBTQ community during a House Oversight Committee hearing in February.
In April, Mace got in a conflict with a transgender student at the University of South Carolina when the student asked Mace to apologize for using the word “tranny” during an April event hosted by USC’s chapter of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative viewpoints on high school and college campuses across the country.
Following that exchange, an Upstate transgender woman threatened on social media to kill Mace. The woman was arrested and charged with threatening the life of a public official. That case is still pending.
Town hall series announced
Ahead of officially launching her campaign, Mace also announced a statewide series of speaking engagements that her team is calling “the Mother of All Town Halls,” starting in Myrtle Beach Wednesday.
“No questions off limits, no topics too tough,” Mace’s spokeswoman Sydney Long said in a statement to NBC affiliate WCBD News 2 . “She’ll be traveling across South Carolina to speak directly with residents.”
Mace has previously been criticized for not holding in-person town halls, including a profanity-laden conflict with a man in an Ulta Beauty store who questioned her for her lack of events.

But it won't take effect for at least a few years.","President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill” will make changes to how some people qualify or remain eligible for either Medicaid or food assistance over the next couple of years.
One of those revisions is the implementation of new work requirements — more people will need to work, train or volunteer at least 80 hours a month for access to these programs in the coming years, though there are various exemptions.
Those rules will apply to Medicaid, which is known as HUSKY in Connecticut, as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP.
Supporters say it encourages participation in the workforce and ensures people aren’t taking advantage of safety net programs. But critics argue a majority of people who access these programs are already working and it imposes an extra layer for them to prove they’re engaging in the workforce or in a training program.
Since the “big beautiful bill” was enacted into law only a month ago, states are still figuring out what the changes will look like for applicants and beneficiaries as well as the agencies that’ll need to administer and enforce the new standards.
Here’s what we know so far.
What are work requirements and does Connecticut currently have them?
Public assistance programs may impose rules for some enrollees to be able to access and keep benefits. Such a requirement doesn’t necessarily mean an individual needs to get a job. A person can usually volunteer or participate in a training program to qualify.
Connecticut and most states don’t currently have any for Medicaid, and it will be a first when the new law kicks in on this front.
There are a set of nationwide rules already in place for SNAP benefits: general work requirements and additional ones for able-bodied adults without dependents.
The general requirement means you must register for work, participate in a SNAP Employment and Training program, take a “suitable job” if offered one and must not voluntarily leave a job or change hours to less than 30 hours a week “without a good reason.” There are exceptions for those who are pregnant, in school, as well as for caretakers of young children.
Able-bodied adults without dependents between the ages of 18 and 54 need to work or be involved in community engagement for at least 80 hours a month. If you don’t meet that requirement, you can lose SNAP benefits after three months and may need to wait the three-year period to get them again.
For SNAP, a dependent is currently defined as someone under the age of 18, but it is subject to change as part of the new law.
Who is exempt under the current and new work requirements?
Under SNAP’s current format, you don’t need to meet the work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents if you are pregnant, have physical and mental limitations, have someone under the age of 18 living in your home, or are already excused under the general work requirement like for those in alcohol and drug treatment programs or if an enrollee is studying or in a training program at least half-time.
There are few groups of able-bodied adults without dependents who are currently excused from work requirements but will lose their exemptions under the new law: veterans, those experiencing homelessness, young adults aging out of foster care and parents and guardians who have someone 14 years and older living with them.
Once work requirements are enacted for HUSKY, there will be nearly a dozen exemptions: those who are pregnant and postpartum, foster youth, disabled veterans, those with alcohol and substance use disorders, beneficiaries who already meet the requirement through other federal programs, individuals with a short-term hardship waiver, recently incarcerated people, parents and caretakers of a dependent under the age of 14 or with a disability, and individuals who are medically frail.
When will the new rules go into effect and will it apply to me?
The exact timing and number of people work requirements will affect is still up in the air, unless you fall in one of the exempted categories listed above.
This is the first time Medicaid will be subject to work requirements in most states. The earliest it’ll go into effect is the beginning of 2027. But states like Connecticut may be able to delay it for another two years until 2029 if they show they are making good faith efforts to implement them.
The new rules will apply to the Medicaid expansion population, known as HUSKY D in Connecticut, which includes coverage for low-income adults without dependents.
For this population, to qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient will need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. That criteria will also apply to parents or guardians who have children ages 14 and older.
The state doesn’t know yet how many people in Connecticut could get kicked off Medicaid or won’t be eligible when applying because of work requirements specifically. But early reports about the “big beautiful bill” from Connecticut’s Department of Social Services and the state comptroller’s office estimate more generally that between 100,000 and 200,000 residents could lose their HUSKY coverage in the future for various reasons.
For SNAP, it will expand the work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents with the same minimum hours of work or community engagement for those on HUSKY. It is not clear when the stricter standards will go into effect and a DSS preliminary report said the effective date is “pending federal guidance.”
The law raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. And it will also apply to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older living at home. The bill lowered the age of a dependent, which is currently under age 18.
How will CT implement work requirements?
Connecticut’s Department of Social Services, which oversees HUSKY and SNAP, is in the process of working out how it’ll address the uptick in verifying eligibility and enforcement around both sets of work requirements.
Officials predict Connecticut could see new expenses ranging from $20 million to $50 million, according to a report from the state comptroller’s office. Those costs will likely be used for new technology and increased staffing levels to see which residents on HUSKY are complying with the work requirements and who is exempt.
In Connecticut, 73% of adults on Medicaid are working, according to the nonprofit KFF. But state officials are warning some enrollees who are already working or those who are eligible for an exemption may lose coverage if they fail to provide the necessary paperwork that they’re meeting the qualifications for benefits.
“Many people who are meeting the requirement are projected to lose coverage due to the new compliance paperwork,” the state comptroller report stated in July. “Many of those not working, for example, due to caregiving responsibilities or a disability, would qualify for an exemption, but even significant numbers of those who should be exempt are expected to be disenrolled due to the new bureaucracy involved with proving it.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/snap-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 07:57:10.850049

The demonstration is part of an effort by local activists who assemble every Friday to protest Colt’s manufacturing role.
Bianca Zerio protested outside of the building with her four-year-old daughter. Zerio said she and her daughter have been rallying with the group every Friday for weeks.
“I think it’s important to get kids to hear things and not just see action and to learn to be kind by example,” Zerio said.
Resolution 41, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is one of several joint resolutions of disapproval introduced by Sanders to block arms sales to Israel.
This particular resolution aimed to block the sale of 20,000 Colt M4 automatic rifles manufactured in the Connecticut Colt factory.
Protester Eamon Ormseth says he won’t stop rallying anytime soon.
“The people in power, the leaders of coal, the leaders of our country, the leader of Israel, need to know that we’re not going away,” Ormset said. “People, our children are starving to death in Gaza as the Israeli army is shooting them while they try to get food. And those guns, some of those guns, are being made right here in West Hartford.”
Though the resolution failed late Wednesday night, it was the first to garner a majority of Democratic Senator votes, including one from Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Murphy, a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has recently been outspoken on the issue.
“The images of children starving to death as a famine unfolds across Gaza shock anyone with a conscience,” Murphy said in a statement. “The situation is completely untenable, and I believe the United States cannot continue to militarily support the Netanyahu government so long as it is refusing to take the necessary steps to urgently alleviate this crisis.”
Connecticut’s Senators diverged on the matter, with Blumenthal voting no on the proposed weapons sale ban. Blumenthal joined 17 fellow Democrats who voted no on the resolution, while 27 voted yes.

Vermont should not simply follow the rest of the nation in a backward direction on worker protection. We should be a model state in terms of labor laws.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Casey Jennings: Workplace protections in the Trump administration.","This commentary is by Casey Jennings of Lunenburg. He has a master’s degree in forestry and has worked a variety of jobs outdoors, ranging from the U.S. Forestry Service to the private sector.


With the Trump administration attempting to destroy the National Labor Relations Board and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., introducing a bill in Congress to abolish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, I am calling on the Vermont Legislature to expand worker protection in the state to counter any fallout. 
I ask that private sector employees be allowed to bring their claims to the Vermont Labor Relations Board, that steps be taken to ensure VOSHA will not be impacted by any federal changes, and that H.348, a bill aimed at protecting workers from extreme temperatures, be passed.
I believe it reasonable that employers be required by statute to provide workers with opportunities to warm up when working in winter temperatures. I have witnessed coworkers in single-digit temperatures and subzero wind chills outdoors allowed only one or two short bathroom breaks for 8-hour shifts. One coworker’s nose was frostbitten while others experienced borderline hypothermia. This is unacceptable.
Vermont has also experienced record-high temperatures this summer, with temperatures hitting the upper 90s. It is probable that Vermont will continue seeing these extreme summer temperatures due to climate change.
I remember years ago working in a factory when it was merely in the 80s outside, and over 100 inside. It was quite unbearable, but normal production was still expected — and the one time I expressed concerns to management as well as to OSHA, it was rather callously brushed aside. 
It shouldn’t be accepted as normal when there are reasonable ways of addressing this problem, including extra breaks and better ventilation. A federal proposal was issued by OSHA under the Biden administration to better protect workers from hot temperatures, but it seems unlikely that the Trump administration will follow through with the ongoing rulemaking process.
Vermont should not simply follow the rest of the nation in a backward direction on this subject. We should be a model state in terms of labor laws, and protecting workers from our increasingly extreme weather should be a top priority.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)About 200 new laws that Colorado lawmakers passed this year go into effect Aug. 6, ranging from comprehensive updates to wage theft protections to smaller tweaks in state statutes.
Here are some of the new laws that Coloradans should know.
Stronger voter protections
Colorado lawmakers passed stronger voter protections this year in anticipation of federal rollbacks of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The new law protects access for voters in jail and allows the attorney general to enforce voting rights. It bans efforts to limit someone’s right to vote based on gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation.
Updated wage theft law
A new wage theft law will impose fines on employers that misclassify employee types that affect their compensation. Fines range from $5,000 to $50,000 for multiple violations that are not fixed within two months. The new law will also reduce the time the state needs to wait before paying an aggrieved employee out of the state’s Wage Theft Enforcement Fund from six months to four months, so those people will get their earned money faster.
The new law will also protect contractors from retaliation for taking protection under wage and hour laws. It also makes illegal efforts to use an employee’s immigration status against them to impact their pay and responsibilities at work
Starting next July, the state Labor Department will adjudicate wage theft claims up to $13,000, double the current threshold.
Free state park access to tribal members

	
Enrolled members of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe are now able to enter any of Colorado’s 43 state parks for free with a current tribal identification card. During the bill’s legislative process, the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in northeastern Utah attempted to amend it to include their members.
By next June, Colorado Parks and Wildlife will need to expand its efforts to engage with the state’s indigenous communities about state parks, according to the bill.
Protection for transit workers

	
It is now misdemeanor harassment to interfere with a transit worker, such as a bus driver or train operator, while they are doing their job. Additionally, the Regional Transportation District that covers the Denver metro area is now eligible to receive part of the $350 million voters approved last year for law enforcement agencies and personnel.
Official state mushroom designation

	
Colorado officially has a state mushroom: the Agaricus julius, also known as the emperor mushroom. The bill behind the designation was a project from the politics club at Horizon High School in Thornton. Colorado joins seven other states with official state mushrooms.
Labeling for gas stoves

	
Retailers will need to affix warning labels on gas stoves for sale in the state that read “Understand the air quality implications of having an indoor gas stove,” with a link to a webpage from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment about the health impacts of gas stoves. Research has shown that gas stoves can lead to respiratory conditions and cancer.
Limit on public pet sales

	
It is now illegal to sell a pet, advertise the sale or offer a pet for adoption on the side of the road, in a parking lot or in a public market. People and businesses licensed under the Pet Animal Care and Facilities Act are still able to sell animals in public spaces. The new law does not apply to livestock sales or hunting dogs.
Privacy for ranchers

	
The information of people who request compensation for destruction caused by wildlife, such as wolf killings of livestock, are not subject to open records requests. That includes the person’s name, phone number, home address, business address, personal email address and business email address.
Information about conflict mitigation, the number of damage claims and the amount of money paid out to claimants are still subject to requests.
The bill’s legislative declaration states that ranchers have been reluctant to file claims following wolf depredations out of fear that people will contact them or go to their property to view the wolves. Colorado voters approved gray wolf reintroduction in 2020, and Colorado Parks and Wildlife began relocating wolves to the state in December 2023. Since then, there have been numerous livestock killings in Western Slope counties.
Punishment for AI generated pornographic photos

	
Realistic, sexually-explicit photos created by artificial intelligence are now covered under Colorado’s existing child pornography laws. It is also a crime to post computer-generated explicit photos of someone without their consent or with the intent of harming them. The new law creates a pathway for the subject of an obscene AI-generated photo to sue the person who posted the image.
Dog breeds in rental insurance

	
Insurers are not allowed to refuse, cancel or increase the cost of coverage for multifamily and rental property based on the breed of dog a policy owner has. Additionally, renters in publicly-financed housing will be allowed to have up to two pets starting next year.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gunfire has echoed near Indiana’s K-12 campuses more than 2,700 times over the past decade — a trend that researchers, child advocates, and school safety experts say demands expanded training, stronger trauma support systems, and greater investment in community-based resources.
Data compiled by The Trace’s Gun Violence Data Hub found at least 2,771 shootings within earshot — about four city blocks — of an Indiana school between 2015 and 2024. The data includes traditional public, charter and private schools.
These “school-adjacent” shootings don’t often occur on school grounds, but instead unfolded during or shortly after school hours in surrounding communities, forcing school leaders to cope with trauma that starts beyond their fences but often ripples into classrooms.










Just hearing a gunshot in your neighborhood, knowing that violence is nearby, changes how young people interact with the world.


– Lauren Magee, assistant professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine


Data shows gun violence disproportionately affects majority-Black campuses in the urban core. The five Hoosier schools most affected — all serving majority-Black students — have each endured more than 40 nearby shootings in the past 10 years alone.
“Just hearing a gunshot in your neighborhood, knowing that violence is nearby, changes how young people interact with the world,” said Lauren Magee, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine. “These aren’t isolated moments — they ripple through communities, through school culture, and into the homes of every student who walks past a memorial on their way to class.”
Neighborhoods most affected
The Trace data shows most shootings are concentrated in a handful of Indiana cities — especially Indianapolis, which accounts for more than half of the incidents recorded during the 10-year span. Other heavily impacted areas include Gary, Fort Wayne and South Bend. 
Within those cities, several schools were more affected by repeated gunfire.
Indianapolis’s Brookside Elementary School 54, for example, was within four blocks of at least 48 separate shootings between 2015 and 2024, topping the list of schools statewide.


Several other schools saw similar numbers, including Gary Middle College with adjacent 45 shootings; Holy Angels Catholic School, in Indianapolis, also with 45 shootings; 21st Century Charter School of Gary with 43 shootings; and Ralph Waldo Emerson School, in Indianapolis, additionally with 43 adjacent shootings.
At least 22 schools were within earshot of 20 or more gunshots in the 10-year period, according to the data. Nearly 50 Hoosier schools experienced at least 15 nearby shootings.
“But these aren’t just isolated incidents,” said Meisha Wide, executive director of the Children’s Policy and Law Initiative of Indiana. “We’re looking at systemic issues where families are struggling to meet basic needs, and youth are often unsupervised after school.”
She pointed to The Trace’s data showing that many shootings occur in the after-school window — between 6 p.m. and midnight — when students are leaving school, in transit, or unwinding in their neighborhoods, and when students often lack structured activities and adult supervision.


Wide emphasized, too, that communities experiencing more frequent shootings are disproportionately affected by profound economic challenges.
“If you’re not able to meet your basic needs of finances, this results in finding alternative ways to survive,” Wide explained. She noted that poverty, eviction, and limited job opportunities compound cycles of violence in these neighborhoods.
“It’s deeper than just the proximity of the school,” Wide continued. “It’s going to require pulling back and having a broader lens to understand what resources are like in that area.”
‘Preparedness’ key for schools
Julie Quesenbery, a school resource officer in Columbus and president of the Indiana School Resource Officers Association, warned that preparedness is “critical” when violence occurs near a campus. 
“A plan is only so good if people don’t know what’s in the crisis plan,” she said. “When it’s time to perform, the time to prepare has passed.”

Quesenbery stressed the importance of clear protocols for lockdowns, communication, and reunification. She emphasized the need for controlled building access, well-marked evacuation routes, and routine training for all staff.
Indiana law currently requires schools to conduct at least one manmade disaster drill each semester and maintain a safety plan. The Indiana Department of Education and Department of Homeland Security also recommend schools form safety committees, work closely with local law enforcement, and conduct active shooter training. Still, implementation varies widely between districts.
Quesenbery said “effective” school safety requires a collaborative approach involving the entire school ecosystem — not just officers, but teachers, administrators, families and community partners.
“Safety is not just up to me, it’s not just up to you, it’s up to all of us,” she said. 
She also underscored the significance of mental health services and community partnerships in addressing and preventing violence near schools.
“We can’t just react to the problem,” Quesenbery said. “We have to be part of the solution.”
Wide added that many schools lack the staff needed to support students in the wake of trauma. 
She noted that school counselors and social workers are also in short supply. The student-to-counselor ratio in Indiana — last reported at about 497 to 1 — is among the worst in the nation.
The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 students per school counselor.
“There’s just not enough staff to meet the needs of kids who are experiencing this kind of repeated trauma,” Wide said. “We need more mental health practitioners in schools, and we need them to be culturally responsive and trained in trauma-informed care.”
Beyond the school fence
Experts emphasize that while these shootings don’t occur inside school buildings, their psychological toll can be “incredibly” significant.
Magee’s research found that students who are chronically exposed to community violence — whether they witness it, hear it, or know someone affected — show heightened signs of trauma, depression and behavioral struggles.
“When we ask youth about their safety, what they talk about isn’t always school-specific — it’s walking to the bus, or playing outside, or scrolling social media and seeing another friend killed,” Magee said. “It creates a chronic stress environment.”

In a recent study co-authored by Magee, which examined firearm-related injuries among youth in Indianapolis, she found that adolescent firearm injuries most commonly occurred in public settings, such as streets, parks or near schools.
Although few incidents took place inside school buildings, many happened near schools or along routes students commonly travel.
“One of the most important findings was that firearm violence doesn’t only affect the immediate victim,” Magee said. “The psychological and academic impacts extend to their peers, families, teachers — and school climate more broadly.”
Her research also found correlations between proximity to gun violence and negative academic outcomes — including lower test scores and increased disciplinary action.
ILEARN results for schools with higher numbers of adjacent shootings, for example, were below statewide averages. 
“We’re asking kids to sit in algebra class after witnessing — or hearing — a shooting,” Magee said. “It’s untenable.”
Her research further concluded that Black youth and families are disproportionately exposed to firearm injury and its ripple effects.
That inequity is echoed in a new, separate report from the Violence Policy Center that ranked Indiana eighth in the nation for Black homicide victimization, with a rate of 39.7 per 100,000 in 2023, the most recent year with available data. 
Indiana recorded 290 Black homicide victims that year. Most, about 90%, were shot.
Forty of those killed were under 18 years old, and most were killed by someone they knew. The majority of incidents were not tied to other felonies — they were arguments, disputes or community violence turned fatal, according to the report.
Working towards solutions
Wide’s organization, CPLI, has launched programs like the Youth Justice Leadership Initiative to encourage and assist youth to become advocates in their communities by focusing on violence prevention, peer support and civic engagement.
CPLI’s recently-published best practices report recommends broader community-school partnerships — including engaging businesses to provide mentorships or third-space opportunities, like recreation centers or co-working spaces for teens.

“Often, these shootings are happening after school, during a gap in supervision and support,” Wide said. “Caregivers may be working second shifts, and young people are left with few safe places to go. We see the consequences of that.”
“There are so many vacant buildings in these neighborhoods — why not turn them into youth hubs?” she added. “We need to invest in alternatives to the street.”
Wide and other advocates additionally urged policymakers to look beyond school buildings and consider “the wider neighborhood context.”
“It’s not just about what’s happening inside school walls,” Wide said. “We need a broader lens that sees the whole ecosystem. These are intergenerational issues. And if we don’t meet them with intergenerational solutions, we’ll keep seeing the same patterns.”
She pointed to policies like better tracking of school absences as a step in the right direction.
“You can’t solve truancy if you don’t know why a student isn’t in school,” she said. “Sometimes it’s violence, sometimes it’s poverty, sometimes it’s caregiving responsibilities. But all of that needs to be visible to respond to it.”
Still, Magee cautioned that impact is limited without changes to gun policy itself.
“We can invest in trauma-informed practices, and we should,” she said. “But if we don’t also address the upstream causes — how guns are accessed, how they’re trafficked, how youth are being pulled into violence — then we’re asking schools to clean up a mess they didn’t create.”

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)It would seem as if Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and California Gov. Gavin Newsom don’t have much in common. Yet their recent pronouncements about the need to redraw congressional districts in their states indicate they both are willing to subvert democracy for political gain. 
By moving to redistrict congressional maps mid-cycle, both Abbott and Newsom not only threaten the voting rights of their state’s citizens, but they also threaten to open a Pandora’s box of copycat activity across the country. It’s a dangerous stunt that could cause permanent damage to our democracy.          
Like just about all bad election ideas these days, this one originated in the White House. Earlier this year, Trump appointees at the Department of Justice sent the Texas governor a letter making the controversial claim that four of the state’s majority-minority districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. So, in addition to having a special session to deal with issues surrounding the devastating July 4 floods, Abbott added mid-cycle redistricting to the agenda.
Hyper-aware that Trump’s “Wreck it Ralph” approach to governing could cost them in the mid-terms next year, Republican Texas legislators have made it clear that they prioritize following Trump’s marching orders over protecting their constituents from natural disasters. They were called into special session on July 21 and so far, have spent their time on redistricting, not public safety. That speaks volumes about how important line-drawing is to election outcomes. 
Indiana redistricting earns ‘D’ grade in national report card

But it’s extremely disappointing that Democrats in Texas and beyond have decided on a “fight fire with fire” strategy to bolster their chances of winning back the House next year and are encouraging leaders in blue states to draw maps mid-cycle too. The problem with their cynical approach is that it will continue the deep erosion of fair representation caused by partisan gerrymandering and will result in rigged districts across the country.  
Although he has supported an independent redistricting process in the past, Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke said, “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back to power.”  
But the danger of fighting gerrymandering with more gerrymandering is a deepening of the already heightened sense of disillusionment that so many voters have today. Gerrymandering reduces voters to pawns and often their response is to refuse to play the game, i.e. not vote.  
Newsom’s plan to lead a mid-cycle redistricting charge in California not only threaten the voting rights and fair representation of voters in that state, it will also undermine the state’s Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC), which has become the gold standard for a fair redistricting process.  The governor has suggested that the CRC only has authority to redistrict after the federal census and that the state’s General Assembly could draw maps this year. Any effort to subvert the authority of the redistricting commission will be met by litigation, so any changes to California’s congressional map will not come easy, nor should they.  
Indeed, if Texas, California or any other state chooses to redistrict outside the normal parameters, their resulting maps will be challenged by advocacy groups, causing problems and confusion for candidates and voters alike ahead of the critical 2026 elections. Instead of trying to fight fire with fire, politicians should douse the flames of these cynical power grabs by remembering that playing with fire usually ends up with everything burning down.  
Do they really want to torch democracy for short-term electoral advantage?

Thankfully, there doesn’t seem to be any enthusiasm for these games among Indiana’s Republican leadership. And, at the local level, Common Cause Indiana is working with activists and local elected officials in Valparaiso to pass an ordinance to create a bipartisan citizens redistricting commission to draw maps during the 2032 round of local redistricting. We’re expanding this effort to several other cities soon.  
As the overheated rhetoric continues at the national level, it is truly refreshing to work with Hoosiers who understand that the goal should be fair redistricting, not a ruthless power grab.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)National research laboratories in Colorado, Oregon and Washington focused on addressing climate change and its impacts and improving energy efficiency and affordability for Americans would be gutted under budgets proposed by President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.
The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, based in Richland, Washington and Portland, Oregon, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, would see their funding in the year ahead nearly halved under the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget for the U.S. Department of Energy. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are negotiating spending bills for the next fiscal year that begins in October and will decide on the energy agency’s budget after Sept. 2, when they return from their August recess. 
The national labs are meant to lead research and scientific experimentation in climate and clean energy strategies, including measuring extreme weather risks by collecting and analyzing atmospheric data from around the world and improving battery and grid technologies to get more wind and solar energy flowing to homes and businesses. They also study energy efficiency across U.S. infrastructure and commerce, all of which is meant to save Americans and businesses money and to curb climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Andrea McMakin, a former communications specialist and 34-year veteran of the Northwest Laboratory in Richland, said the U.S. risks losing its best scientists if the proposed funding cuts go through.
McMakin is part of the group Friends of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which has been raising concerns about the cuts. McMakin said the group learned in June that the lab’s former director told staff in a meeting that up to 1,000 people could be cut if the current budget passes, a number that’s been echoed by state leaders. 
“Those people leave. They have to find jobs someplace. And we’re seeing that a lot of other countries are stepping up their recruiting to get U.S. scientists and engineers,” McMakin said. “We don’t want to see that. We want to keep our energy competitiveness and we want to keep our brain power here in the U.S.”










This administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs.


– U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington


A recent report from Politico cites two sources familiar with U.S. Department of Energy facilities who said up to 1,000 people could be cut from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.
Heather Lammers, a spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the lab is talking with the federal energy department to fully understand the impacts of its proposed spending cuts.
The Northwest Laboratory’s public affairs officer, Dawn Zimmerman, did not confirm figures for potential staff cuts and said the U.S. Department of Energy requires all queries involving the federal budget to be directed to its public affairs office. An unnamed energy department spokesperson said in an email that personnel decisions are dictated by the labs directly, not the federal government. 
“The Department of Energy is committed to making the American people’s government more efficient while also growing the output of top-quality science at our national labs,” the spokesperson wrote.
Proposed cuts
Trump proposed in May cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. energy department by about $3.5 billion. Of that, $2.5 billion would be cut from the agency’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — a 74% reduction from its current budget. 
The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, established following the 1973 oil crisis, in recent years has focused on researching, developing and deploying technologies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s electricity sector. That technology includes batteries that can hold large amounts of wind and solar power, and white LED light bulbs that require far less energy than incandescent and fluorescent lights.
The budget also cuts 14%, or $1.15 billion, from the department’s Biological and Environmental Research program, meant to collect and analyze climate change data.
Both the Colorado lab and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory get most of their funding from those two programs. But under Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, the Renewable Energy Lab would lose $387 million in funding – more than half of its current budget. 
Lammers, the spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Lab, said it also receives funding from state and tribal governments and some private industry partners.
“We remain committed to our mission of delivering integrated solutions for an affordable, secure and reliable energy future through research, innovation and strategic collaboration,” she said.
The Northwest National Lab would lose about $280 million, a third of its current budget. 
The lab, which employs more than 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Washington’s Tri-Cities area, which includes Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, according to the area’s development council.
State lawmakers weigh in
Washington’s U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said the Republican budget for the energy department would be a “devastating blow” to the Northwest National Lab.
“Make no mistake: if Trump’s budget request were to become law, it would result in the loss of over 1,000 jobs at PNNL. On top of that, this administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs — this move alone could force major layoffs at PNNL,” she said in a statement.
Murray, the lead Democrat and vice chair on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she would fight the proposed cuts. 
“President Trump’s budget is dead on arrival in the Senate as far as I’m concerned,” she said. “I’m working to write a bipartisan funding bill that will protect investments in our national labs and save the jobs President Trump is thoughtlessly seeking to eliminate.” 
Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, said in an email the Republican budget is “anti-science” and will harm clean energy industries gaining traction and growing in parts of the state.
“I just had five town halls in eastern Oregon where wind turbines and solar panels are taking full advantage of renewable energy options that lower prices for consumers and fight the climate crisis,” Wyden said. “That’s but one clear example of how this latest Republican scheme to slash research investments in clean energy would be both nonsense and anti-science.”
Wyden said he voted against confirming oil executive Audrey Robertson as Trump’s appointee for assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the federal energy agency, in large part because Trump said he wanted to cut renewable energy investments. 
Trump threatened nearly identical cuts for the energy department during his first presidency in 2017, but Congress ultimately ignored the president’s suggested budget for the agency. McMakin said she remembers staff of the Northwest National Lab starting to change the way they talked about their work so they wouldn’t draw Trump’s attention.
“I remember at that time it was like, we have to change. We can’t say ‘atmospheric climate science’ anymore, we have to say ‘earth sciences,’ because it was just one of those language things that if you said climate science or anything about climate you are in danger of getting your funding cut,” she said.

This voting location is one of the most popular in the county. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Tuesday’s primary will gauge the political climate in Washington and provide an early forecast of how the makeup of the state Legislature could change this fall.
Nine Democratic state lawmakers, all appointed to their seats, are running to retain them. It’s a larger-than-usual number of legislative contests in an odd-year election cycle and, for Democrats, a lot of seats to defend.
They don’t have to sweat over all of them. Five involve legislators who are unopposed or heavily favored to finish in the top two on Tuesday and advance to the general election.
Those four other match-ups are attracting loads of attention and bountiful spending by candidates and their allies. 
Contests for two Senate seats will be the first test of voters’ views on higher taxes, budget decisions and new laws passed last session by majority Democrats over the objections of Republicans.
Races for two other seats feature intraparty battles exposing and amplifying strains within the Democratic Party among its progressive and centrist forces.
Here are the four races to watch Tuesday.
Republicans’ best hope
Republicans sense the duel in the 26th Legislative District may be their best chance this year for chipping away at Democrats’ 30-19 seat advantage in the state Senate. 
That’s because Democratic Sen. Deb Krishnadasan, a former school board director making her case to voters for the first time as a lawmaker, faces Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier, winner of six straight House races in the district, the last with nearly 55% of the vote.
They are vying to represent the district that encompasses parts of Kitsap and Pierce counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor.
Krishnadasan, who served six years on the Peninsula School District Board of Directors, was among the vulnerable Democrats voting against her party’s major tax bills and transportation revenue package this past session. 
But that hasn’t stopped business- and Republican-backed political committees from spending a little more than a quarter million dollars as of Thursday to tie her to Democrats’ tax hikes. 
They are hammering out a message that the most significant new tax increases fall on businesses, and some Democrats wanted to go further with heftier levies on large companies and wealthy individuals. 
Caldier’s campaigning on the theme that Democrats overreached and reducing their numbers in the Senate is the best means of preventing a recurrence in 2026.
As the only two candidates, both will advance. Why spend so much money now? Each side hopes to get a sense of which issues resonate with voters. And they know winners of primaries generally go on to victory in the general election.
Republicans’ second-best hope
A similar dynamic is at play in the 5th District in east King County.
Victoria Hunt, a Democrat, who easily won a House seat last November, moved to the Senate a few weeks ago following the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos. 
She’s up against an experienced Republican candidate, Chad Magendanz. A former two-term state representative in the district, he ran for Senate last year and lost to Ramos. In 2022, Magendanz tried unsuccessfully to win a House seat.
As in the 26th District race, a major focus is on the new and higher taxes enacted in the 2025 legislative session.
Unlike Krishnadasan, Hunt did vote for the tax bills and has defended her decision to do so. A political committee devoted to electing progressive Democrats has shelled out $40,000 in an independent effort to bolster her candidacy.
On the other side, the state Republican Party and the same business-backed political enterprise at play in the 26th District are behind $210,000 in spending on mailers, texts and digital ads opposing Hunt. 
That’s a change. Those political forces stayed out of the November election as Ramos beat Magendanz by 3,400 votes. The Senate Republican Caucus didn’t lift a financial finger either, but is doing so now. These forces must be feeling something akin to confidence ahead of Tuesday.



The other 5 races 
In Tuesday’s primary, the top two finishers move on to the general election.
In five races, incumbents are either expected to safely scoot through or they are running unopposed.
Reps. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, and Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, each drew two opponents and both are expected to advance.
In the 41st District, Zahn faces Democrat Vinita Kak of Newcastle and Republican John Whitney of Bellevue. In the 48th District, Salahuddin is challenged by Ranga Bondada and Dennis Ellis. 
Three appointed legislators — state Sens. Tina Orwall of Des Moines and Emily Alvarado of Seattle, and Rep. Brianna Thomas of West Seattle — are all unopposed. Orwall serves the 33rd District with Alvarado and Thomas representing the 34th District.  


On to November for two Democrats? Or just one?
The 33rd District is a Democratic stronghold. It is one of the test sites for how progressive the party’s voters are feeling. 
Democratic state Rep. Edwin Obras, a liberal in his first run for office, is facing a spirited challenge from Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling, a moderate Democrat with a couple of local election wins under his belt. Daryl Jones, a Republican, is also on the ballot.
The big question Tuesday is whether enough Democratic voters turn out to advance both of the party’s wannabe torchbearers. A year ago, Republican candidates in this district collected 30% of the vote in the primary, then 31% in the general election. That means it is mathematically doable for both Democratic candidates to make it through to November.
Obras and Schilling, and their supporters, aren’t waiting to chance it. Obras has spent $131,000 to Schilling’s $126,000 and each has been the target of tens of thousands of dollars of hit pieces from independent political committees. 
A third-place finish for Obras on Tuesday means he won’t return to the Legislature in January. 
Big dollar Democratic showdown
Sen. Vandana Slatter, of Bellevue, and Rep. Amy Walen, of Kirkland, are squaring off in an expensive Democrat-versus-Democrat grudge match in the 48th District, where both enjoy broad support among its voters in Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
Already $700,000 has been shelled out collectively by the candidates and independently-run campaigns of their allies. With both women assured of moving on, all those dollars are about educating voters on some of their differences.
Slatter is the progressive, Walen the business-friendly moderate. The two voted similarly on many bills last session, but differed on a few of the marquee policies. 
Both opposed a bill containing an across-the-board increase in the business tax and surcharges on the state’s largest corporations and financial institutions. And both supported another key component of the $9.4 billion tax package that extends the retail sales tax to some services.
Slatter voted for a gas tax increase. Walen did not. Walen opposed the new rent increase cap. Slatter voted for it.
With no Republican in the running, differences on policies like those could motivate GOP voters to engage. But ultimately, this race will be a barometer of how Democratic and independent voters are feeling. Most have cast ballots for both candidates before and now must choose one.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0189-Large-e1722992752713-1024x728.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 07:57:10.850049

The companies have opposed such moves. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Business groups, gig workers, and freelancers are fighting what they say is the state’s latest attempt to limit the availability of independent contractor status that they say gives workers and businesses needed flexibility.
The opposition targets proposed regulations from the New Jersey Department of Labor that would regulate an examination, called the ABC test, that the state uses to determine whether workers are employees entitled to unemployment, family leave, and disability benefits — or are independent contractors not required to pay into the funds that fuel those benefits.
The Murphy administration has previously characterized companies’ push to classify some workers as independent contractors as one that denies employees benefits required by law. Labor officials’ proposed regulations would ensnare some companies like Uber and Lyft that have fought efforts to classify their drivers as employees.
Kim Kavin is a freelance writer and co-founder of Fight for Freelancers, a group that helped defeat a 2019 bill that would have altered New Jersey’s ABC test.
“This is more of the same. It’s all part and parcel of the same campaign that has been waged for years now trying to restrict independent contracting, and it needs to stop,” Kavin said.
To be marked as an independent contractor, a worker must pass all three prongs of the ABC test, which measures whether a worker is free of their employers’ control, whether a worker’s work is performed outside a firm’s regular course or place of business, and whether a worker is engaged in business independent of a given firm.
Officials could adopt the new proposal after an extended public comment period closes on Aug. 6, with or without changes.
Fighting for workers?
The proposal’s most substantive changes are confined to the test’s second prong, which weighs whether a worker’s services are done outside the usual course or place of an employer’s business.
Examples included in the rules proposal’s text would designate ride-share drivers’ vehicles as a place of business for the companies they drive for. Because workers must meet all three prongs of the ABC test to be classed as independent contractors, that example would require ride-share drivers to be treated as employees.
New Jersey has for years insisted those drivers are employees entitled to benefits and argued they and their employers are liable for unemployment, temporary disability, and family leave payroll taxes.
Uber in 2022 paid New Jersey $100 million to resolve claims of more than $600 million in unpaid taxes and interest the state said were owed due to worker misclassification between 2014 and 2018. The amount owed was reduced after the firm gave the state access to more records, and Uber maintains its employees are independent contractors.
New Jersey last year alleged Lyft, another ride-share company, owed the state $17 million in payroll taxes unpaid due to misclassification. Lyft, like Uber, maintains that its drivers are independent contractors under the ABC test and that its role is limited to acting as a platform that connects drivers with passengers.
Ride-share companies have typically prevailed in lawsuits challenging their drivers’ independent contractor classifications, though the question has not been thoroughly tested in New Jersey courts.
Roughly 20 state legislators spanning both parties have expressed concerns about the rules proposal, including that it may go beyond the statutes and case law governing worker classification. The group, which is growing, includes chairs of the Senate labor, commerce, transportation, and legislative oversight committees.

Democratic legislators in the 18th District said in a Thursday letter to Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo that classifying workers should be the job of lawmakers, not state regulators.
“The question of how to classify workers has been considered repeatedly by the Legislature, and similar efforts to change the standard through statute have not gained approval. The decision to implement such a major policy change through regulation, rather than legislation, risks creating confusion among both workers and employers,” the letter reads.
Sen. Pat Diegnan and Assemblymen Sterley Stanley and Robert Karabinchak, all Middlesex County Democrats, added their “concerns with the proposed rule are wide-ranging and substantive.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Labor declined to comment on criticism of the rules proposal. In a summary attached to the proposal, the department said it is merely codifying practices stemming from statute and case law that labor commissioners have employed for years.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat in the final months of his second term, established a task force in 2018 to examine misclassification.
“Hardworking New Jersey workers should not be kept from receiving the pay and benefits they deserve,”  Murphy said last month to mark the sixth anniversary of the task force’s report. “Protecting our workers has always been a top priority of our administration as we maintain a strong and fair economy. We’ll keep fighting against those who exploit and cheat them.”
A ‘huge concern’ for businesses
Other changes in the proposal would classify customers’ homes as a place of business for drywall installers, limiting their ability to employ independent contractors to install drywall; name caddies working for country clubs as employees; and say truck drivers working for a trucking company may be classed as employees.
Elissa Frank, vice president of government affairs for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the state’s plan would create “employment relationships that don’t currently exist.”
“Those people under the examples that are cited in the rule are currently serving under independent contractor status,” said Frank. “That’s a huge concern because it’s hitting at the flexibility of the business.”
Planned changes to the ABC test’s second prong note that workers outside of a firm’s normal course of business — say, someone hired to clean a dentist’s office — could still be classified as independent contractors.
Other portions of the state’s proposal offer fewer changes but have nonetheless alarmed freelancers and business groups.
The proposal would add a non-exhaustive list of criteria to determine whether an employer controls or directs an individual’s work. That list includes questions like whether the business requires the individual to work set hours, use specific tools, or wear a particular uniform, among several others. 
Some have worried the list’s non-exhaustive nature — meaning officials can consider factors not listed there — would create uncertainty among contractors.
“I wouldn’t say it’s a substantive change, but the fact that it’s non-exhaustive is a difference to the existing standard,” Frank said, adding it could lower the bar to classify independent contractors as employees.
Courts use those criteria when adjudicating misclassification cases.
In Carpet Remnant Warehouse v. Department of Labor, a 1991 New Jersey Supreme Court decision on worker misclassification cited in the rules proposal, justices found carpet installers that did jobs for a carpet sales business were not under the business’ control because the installers could determine the means of installation, freely choose — or not choose — from the business’s posted jobs, and work for the business’s competitors, among other factors. 
The test’s final prong measures whether a worker is engaged in “independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.” It typically measures whether an individual’s business would survive the loss of income stemming from the end of a relationship with one business.
There, too, the proposal adds a non-exhaustive list that includes factors like how many clients the individual has, how their income breaks out among clients, and the individual’s investment in their own tools and equipment, among several other factors courts use when adjudicating misclassification cases.
Frank said the proposal would make some bona fide independent contractors vulnerable to employee classification, raising the hypothetical of a heating, ventilation, and cooling technician who incorporates her own firm, secures her own tools and insurance, and gathers jobs from several clients — including one she works with frequently.
The frequent client’s workload, a lack of employees at the technician’s firm, and her lack of office space could make the hypothetical contractor vulnerable to an employee classification she would not seek, Frank said.
“This hypothetical shows how the proposed rule shifts the bar from functional independence to structural perfection — penalizing legitimate small businesses that don’t have the scale or resources to meet every new evidentiary factor,” she said.

They are advocating for increased state regulations to protect people that have incurred medical debt and to ensure greater pricing transparency from hospitals in the state ahead of medical procedures.
Over a third of U.S. adults face debt from medical or dental bills. The debt is one of the leading causes of bankruptcy in the country, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation supporting independent health care research. The report found that medical debt greatly affects both insured and uninsured individuals and the fear of incurring debt often deters Americans from seeking care.

Oklahoma Senate Bill 889 requires hospitals to make the cost of their “most usable” services transparent to patients so they’re aware of the cost, said Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, the bill author. 
The measure was signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt and will be in effect Nov. 1. 
“If this is implemented across the United States, it could save billions of dollars in health care costs,” Murdock said. 
The new law has “teeth” because providers could face penalties for noncompliance, and hospitals will be more inclined to comply with transparency rules if there’s potential financial impact, Murdock said.
Oklahoma’s State Department of Health is charged with overseeing compliance. 
The agency is “actively preparing,” said agency spokesperson Erica Rankin. There are no anticipated additional costs for implementing the law, she said, and while details are not finalized, the department is confident it will be fully compliant. 
In a similar effort, House Bill 4148, authored by Rep. Suzanne Schreiber, D-Tulsa, and signed into law in 2024, requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients of the institution. 
The Oklahoma Hospital Association is supportive of greater price transparency, said Rich Rasmussen, CEO and president of the group, but overburdensome regulations can affect hospital operations. 
“We don’t want to be noncompliant with any requirement placed on us, but oftentimes, when a state comes in after the federal government has made a policy decision and decides to do something on their own, it creates that noncompliance,” he said. “And that’s what we want to avoid.”
Rasmussen pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which lists which U.S. hospitals have faced civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with federal price transparency regulations. No Oklahoma hospital has faced a penalty, according to the list.
  Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, asks questions about a bill on the Senate floor on May 5. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)
The Hospital Association has gone beyond what’s required by federal law to standardize reporting, Rasmussen said. 
“We began an effort to bring all of our hospitals together on a very broad what we call our community benefit project,” he said. “We have worked together with hospitals all across the state to arrive at, for those who are uninsured or underinsured, what hospitals can do to ensure that if they are eligible for our free or discounted care, that that would be the same measurement that is used across the state.”
Rasmussen said Congress cutting billions in Medicaid dollars will have a domino effect of impacts. 
Hospitals may cut services, forcing patients to travel or not receive care at all. Other Oklahomans will be kicked off Medicaid and have to find coverage elsewhere. 
“We can’t cut our way out of $6.3 billion of Medicaid reductions,” Rasmussen said. 
Rasmussen said he’d like to see greater pricing transparency from insurers, not just providers. Oklahomans with insurance don’t know how much their hospital bills will be and insurers aren’t transparent enough about out-of-pocket costs, he said. 
The Commonwealth Fund’s report found that while insured patients are less likely to owe medical debt than the uninsured, about a third of adults insured through employers still incur debt. 
Oklahoma lacks medical debt protections in place in other states, including no limits on interest rates, credit reporting, and wage garnishments related to medical debt, according to the report.
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, and Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, introduced similar measures during the 2025 session to help minimize the impact of medical debt by prohibiting it from impacting credit scores. Boren and Bennett authored Senate Bill 519 and House Bill 1709, respectively. 
Neither bill advanced from its chamber of origin or forgives medical debt. Both lawmakers said they were interested in pursuing the legislation again when they return next session.

“What I found through representing clients, even some young people, is that the credit rating really is a barrier to finding housing,” Boren said. “And because we have so much medical debt, it’s compromising people’s credit rating, and then it creates a housing issue. So what this bill does is prevent reporting by collection agencies to credit reporting agencies medical debt. It doesn’t prevent the collection of the debt. It just prevents the harm to someone’s credit rating.”
Bennett’s bill specifies that for medical debt to not be reported on someone’s credit, it must be incurred from lifesaving or emergency care. 
The House lawmaker said his bill was prompted by wanting to codify a Biden era rule into state law. 
He said banks were concerned that his bill would prevent them from seeing the “whole picture” behind a consumer before loaning money. Bennett said he’s willing to work with the banking industry on his bill, as long as the integrity of the measure remains intact. 
“As much as I like this idea and want to pursue it, we are tinkering around the edges of a major issue,” Bennett said. “And the reality is, we need an overhaul of the health care industry in America and we’re limited at the state level of what we can do.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Immigration arrests and detentions in Idaho sharply increased in 2025, following trends across the U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in Idaho increased 797% in 2025 from the same time period in 2024, according to an Idaho Capital Sun review of ICE data collected by the Deportation Data Project. The project is led by attorneys and professors from multiple states who obtain public data sets through Freedom of Information Act requests. 
From Jan. 1, 2024, to June 26, 2024, there were 41 reported arrests by ICE agents in Idaho, the data shows. For that time period in 2025, there were 368 arrests. 
Idaho in 2024 and part of 2025 had certified the Elmore County and Jefferson County jails as federal immigration detention centers. From Jan. 1, 2024, to June 26, 2024, there were 65 reported ICE detentions in both of those facilities. For that period in 2025, there were 416 detentions, which is a 540% increase.  
The number of detentions in the first six months of 2025 was more than double the number of detentions recorded for all of 2024.
“We’ve seen an increased number of calls, typically from loved ones whose loved one has been detained,” said Chris Christensen, a Boise immigration attorney. “We have seen a lot more immigration holds … and we’ve also seen a lot more aggressive tactics used by local ICE.” 
Christensen, who has worked in various areas of immigration law since 2009, said he was aware of three recent incidents where ICE agents broke the window of a vehicle to remove someone inside. 
The ages of those detained in Idaho ranged from 18 to 64 years old. 


 Definitions of common immigration terms

ICE arrest: Immigration officials locate and apprehend someone they suspect is in the U.S. illegally. These do not always lead to detentions.
Detention: Some people arrested by ICE agents are detained in facilities such as a county jail or federal detention center.
Immigration hold: ICE may be notified if an inmate in a local jail or prison is likely in the country illegally and will ask the local law enforcement to hold the inmate beyond their release date and transfer custody to immigration authorities.


The youngest people arrested in Idaho were a 6-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy, both from Peru. The two children were arrested at the same time as a 33-year-old woman on Jan. 28 in the Twin Falls area. There is no record showing the woman and children were detained. 
Christensen said in a February meeting with ICE agents in Idaho, local immigration lawyers were told that the agency tries to avoid detaining minors because there is nowhere to hold them in Idaho. Many of those arrested in southern Idaho end up going to a detention facility in Las Vegas, Christensen said. 
The share of those arrested who had criminal convictions declined in 2025 from the year prior. 
Of the arrests made this year, 250, or nearly 68%, of all arrests, were of people with criminal convictions. There were 84 arrests of those with “pending charges,” and 34 people with “other immigration violations,” according to the data. 
In 2024, 34 of the 41 arrests were of those with a criminal conviction, or 82%, and five were of those with pending charges. 
 ICE arrests are up across the U.S., many without prior criminal convictions 

Nationwide, the share of immigrants with criminal convictions has declined overall since January, Stateline reported. From January to late-June, ICE has made nearly 112,000 arrests, and 40% of them were of convicted criminals, the outlet reported. For the same time period in 2024, 53% of the approximately 51,000 arrests were of those with criminal convictions.
Arrests in Washington state rose 35% in the first five months of Donald Trump’s presidency, the Washington State Standard reported, with 782 arrests in 2025 compared to 581 the same period last year. 
Trump administration officials have stated a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests per day; the current average is 711 as of June, the Stateline analysis of data found.

For those who have been in the U.S. for less than two years, officials under the current administration are using a process called expedited removal, Christensen said, which means they may be deported without the opportunity to see an immigration judge. 
As of July, ICE issued a new policy that required those arrested by the agency to remain in detention while challenging their removal, NPR reported. The policy was challenged in court Monday in a class action lawsuit. 
Christensen said this policy reverses a longtime interpretation of the law that allowed those who were considered a low or no threat to the community and a low flight risk to bond out of detention while their case went on in court. 
“Personally, I think it’s the Trump administration using detention to wear immigrants down,” Christensen said. “If you’ve never been in jail before, and you are locked up in an ICE detention facility — which don’t get me wrong, looks exactly like a jail and feels exactly like a jail — people are pretty inclined to give up hope, and maybe give up on their case and return to where they’re from.” 
 Idaho’s law requires cooperation with immigration authorities 

Through a law passed this year and an executive order by Idaho Gov. Brad Little, the state’s regulations largely require cooperation with immigration authorities. 
Idaho State Police partners with ICE to deport inmates without authorization to be in U.S.

On Feb. 18, Little issued an order requiring Idaho State Police and all state agencies to collaborate fully with federal immigration authorities. The order also directed the state’s prison and parole systems to confirm immigration status prior to releasing incarcerated individuals. 
The Idaho Legislature this year also passed House Bill 83, which created new state-level immigration crimes and required cooperation among local authorities and federal agencies for enforcement. 
The ACLU of Idaho challenged the law in court, arguing it superseded the federal government’s authority to enforce federal crimes, the Sun reported. 
A federal judge temporarily blocked the portion of the law that would’ve created state crimes for illegal entry and illegal re-entry, but District Judge Amanda Brailsford did allow the parts of the bill requiring cooperation to go into effect. 
In June, Idaho State Police announced it would enter into an agreement with ICE to assist with transporting undocumented immigrants from Idaho jails to ICE detention facilities. Under the agreement, the state police agreed to spend up to $300,000 for 100 transports, the Sun reported. 
Little supported the effort by utilizing his office’s Emergency Fund to reimburse state police for personnel. 
“Idaho is stepping up to help the Trump administration transport dangerous illegal alien criminals to ICE facilities instead of being released back into our communities,” Little said in a written statement June 5.
There have been no transports under this agreement as of June 30, an ISP spokesperson told the Sun.

The options available to someone who’s been arrested by ICE are different in every case, Christensen said. 
“I think (immigration law) is the most complex body of law out there,” he said. 
The factors at play include a prior criminal history, community ties, the person’s “flight risk,” and others, he said. For those afraid to return to their country of origin, they could apply for asylum or protection under the international human rights treaty, the Convention Against Torture. Some may qualify for protection under the Violence Against Women Act. 
Christensen said he’s also been receiving calls from people who are in the country lawfully, but who fear that may be revoked. His office has additionally seen an increased scrutiny and slower processing of green card applications. 
“I think there is an assault on immigration at all levels,” Christensen said.

Vance and Jeffrey Epstein.  
Minnesota 50501, an organization formed after Trump took office, planned the protest to coincide with “Rage Against the Regime” events nationwide. The smashing, though, was unique to Minnesota — as was the laser-eyed loon displayed on the poster for the event, an image some may remember from the state’s flag contest. 
People looked ready for demolition as they lined up to take a swing at old televisions and watermelons, gearing up in hard hats and goggles.

“[It’s] a safe way to release some pent up aggression and frustrations. Because we live, I swear, just in a constant state of anxiety with the news and just all the chaos,” Melissa Hagen, 44, said. 
Hagen said she was not a frequent protestor but had gone to the No Kings protest in June. “In my generation, or my lifetime, I have not encountered the environment to feel the need to get out. But, I mean, it’s just too much,” she said. 
The sources of frustration were varied — immigration policy, abortion rights, Environmental Protection Agency cuts and Epstein were just a few of the topics discussed by speakers and attendees.

The goal of the protest, beyond venting frustrations, was also to inspire action. Tables from local organizations were standing by for those interested in volunteering. Organizers handed out information with resources for food pantries, housing and work support. 
“It’s just a moment where we need to come together with as many people as we can. The dangers that [Trump] presents to us are immediate and massive,” said Jess Sundin, a local district organizer for Freedom Road Socialist Organization. “I want to smash the system, but until we can do that, let’s smash some garbage.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_0446-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-04 10:58:55.447120

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Hats off to the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, which over the course of the past few months has seemingly transformed itself from a toothless shih tzu into an aggressive, but well-trained pitbull that’s going for the jugular.
For years, the agency and its governing board inspired about as much fear as a cute baby bunny would into the state employees, lobbyists and political candidates that they were supposed to hold accountable. 
The body had also demonstrated a propensity for secrecy, which kept the public in the dark about what they were doing. In 2023, Attorney General Gentner Drummond accused the public board of violating the state Open Meeting Act by discussing the candidate qualifications and details of the search process for their next executive director behind closed doors.
But in recent months something — or someone — has knocked the board’s rose-colored glasses askew, and politicians, lobbyists and statewide political campaigns have been in for a rude awakening. Democrats and Republicans are suddenly discovering they’re dealing with a board that has plenty of teeth and is willing to fight for Oklahomans, consequences be damned.
It’s been an inspiring sight to behold following years of lackluster performance.
In the past few months, Republican State Superintendent Ryan Walters agreed to pay an $18,300 settlement in connection with an improper transfer of funds for a school board election in Jenks and a $5,000 penalty for using his state social media account for personal reasons. Shelley Zumwalt, who once served as a Cabinet secretary for Gov. Kevin Stitt, agreed to pay a $20,000 fine and not to hold any position funded with state dollars for two years to resolve an ethics case involving contracts awarded to a firm her husband worked at. The Commission entered into a settlement agreement with Rep. Ajay Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, to pay the agency $35,000 for a variety of ethics issues related spending campaign funds.
Earlier this month, the Commission disclosed that they’re planning to open another formal investigation into Pittman and will pursue the case in court after she missed payments.
They’ve also disclosed that they’re pursuing a case against the Gamefowl Commission on accusations that it violated financial disclosure rules. The group had been lobbying to reduce the penalty for cockfighting from a felony to a misdemeanor.
Oklahomans appear to finally have the type of board they’ve long deserved and hoped for since 1990 when they voted to create the Ethics Commission and enshrine it into the state’s Constitution so that lawmakers couldn’t abolish it.
I suspect this unexpected about-face is in large part due to Lee Ann Bruce Boone, who in 2024 became the agency’s fourth director. Her predecessor, Ashley Kemp, resigned amid her claims that lawmakers underfunded the agency, making it difficult to enforce compliance.
Kemp probably was correct. Lawmakers for obvious reasons benefit from weak ethics enforcement, and they haven’t really done the agency any favors with funding. Legislators allocated the commission $2.3 million, which is slightly less than they received in the 2025 budget year, according to budgeting documents. It’s also about 36% less than the agency said it actually needs.
But Bruce Boone and the five-member appointed commission she works with have plowed ahead undeterred, holding people accountable for campaign and ethics violations.
But the commission isn’t only aiming to punish. It is moving with an appropriate sense of urgency to consider whether Oklahoma’s elected officials can use campaign funds to cover the cost of security. The request from the state’s top legislative leaders follows the June assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park. They’re hoping to have an opinion crafted before they next meet Aug. 14.
This is the same agency that previously took more than a year to approve a new policy that allows elected officials and candidates to use funds on child care and other caregiving expenses. That change was proposed under Bruce Boone’s predecessor, but the Commission didn’t act on it for months. It took so long, that state Sen. Jessica Garvin, the Republican lawmaker and parent who requested it, had already lost reelection and couldn’t benefit.   
The board has also been transparent about the outcome of its investigations where there aren’t findings of ethics violations, which is a refreshing change. In addition to sending a signal to the public that the board is taking ethics investigations seriously, such disclosure also benefits those officials who are cleared of wrongdoing.
Oklahoma Corporation Commissioner Todd Hiett is one who benefited from this transparency. In May, the Commission cleared the Republican of a conflict of interest allegation stemming from Hiett’s decision to continue to vote on utility rate hikes despite accusations of drunken behavior at a Minnesota regulatory conference.
Perhaps the Commission’s newfound enthusiasm highlights how critical it is that our state leaders pick the correct people to serve on boards and commissions. Because a state agency can only be as good as the board that helps govern it.
The governor, attorney general, Senate president, House speaker and state Supreme Court chief justice each select one of the five board members. The board hires the agency head.
Now perhaps, Oklahomans finally have the right expertise at the helm and a board with the fire to do right by the integrity of the ethics rules they’re supposed to be protecting.
Here’s hoping this board isn’t a one-hit wonder, and they and their successors continue this watchdog mentality for years to come.

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.
After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

In a landscape where print media has been rapidly eroding, Shawn Houck adds a product with Oil City Weekly. In the process, he’s coming full circle.
The post He helms Casper’s top digital news site. Now he’s jumping into the print game. appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Oil City Weekly didn’t quite make its deadline today. 
The weekly’s sister product, Oil City News, has been a digital-only publication for more than a decade, so the staff is well-versed in churning out news. But posting an article and photos online is a whole different affair than shoehorning that same article along with several other stories, letters to the editor, obituaries, advertisements and a sprawling events calendar into 12 printed pages. And just two weeks into the endeavor, staff was still ironing out the process.
“We’re trying to work from going from online to print, as opposed to print to online,” Shawn Houck, the publisher and owner of Oil City Weekly, said from his Casper office that Wednesday afternoon in July. “So we’re trying to find our process.”
Despite the production manager shipping the file to the Douglas press 30 minutes late, Houck’s team remained on schedule to print and deliver the second edition of Casper’s brand-new newspaper the following day. 
The accomplishment marked a small landmark for Houck and the team. One edition is just a newspaper. But with the second edition, he said, “we are now officially a weekly.”
In a media landscape where local news has been rapidly eroding for more than a decade, creating a new print product may raise some eyebrows. Plenty of people warned Houck against what they see as a risky venture, he said. 
But the Casper native isn’t new to building things from scratch or experimenting with media iterations. Along with starting several companies, he owns Oil City News, a site in the vein of the hyper-local websites that began proliferating across the internet around 2010. 
Creating a print publication isn’t new for him either. Houck launched a zine as a college student in the ‘90s. It was a popular pastime then, a punk rock gesture of free expression. 
In a way, Oil City Weekly is punk rock too. It’s a clear step away from the internet that has utterly consumed daily life in 2025. To sit down with a newspaper and read about historic buildings or city council meetings without distractions popping up on screen is to defy the always-online status that has become commonplace. 
“I think there’s nothing more punk rock than embracing this format,” Houck said, “and trying to think about it in a way that will work for today’s news environment.”

Readers, he added, are jazzed to see Casper restored to a two-newspaper town. 
“They’re saying things like, ‘thanks for bringing the newspaper back,’” he said. “We’re not bringing the newspaper back. We’re just distributing it in a different way.”
Back to the roots of print 
Houck is a Casper native, the oldest of six children who grew up in the wind-swept central Wyoming city. He has the wiry build of a marathon runner and the frenetic energy of an ideas guy. His work experience is a blend of advertising, media and upstarts. 
While studying English at the University of Wyoming, Houck enrolled in journalism courses. Outside of the classroom, he published a zine, calling it the 630 Chimichanga — named after his dorm room in White Hall. The small tabloid started as a platform for inside jokes shared among his friends. 
“It was just things we thought were funny,” he said. But over time, it grew to include CD reviews, feature articles, political commentary and regular contributor content. 
He discovered he enjoyed the ad and design side of journalism. After graduating, he started an advertising agency called AdBay and spent many years helming it. 
An admitted serial entrepreneur, Houck had other enterprises percolating. He sold ads to movie theaters around the state, co-owned The Casper Cutthroats baseball team and launched Frontier Brewery, which he still co-owns. In 2020, he sold Adbay and launched Upslope Media. 
Along the way, he acquired Oil City News in 2016, and now also publishes Cap City News in Cheyenne and County 17 in Gillette. That put him in the thick of the hyper-local digital sites that sprouted up to help cover incremental and breaking news in small towns or even neighborhoods. The trend was seen as an effort to fill news holes as traditional newspapers downsized or shifted more coverage to national syndicated wire reporting. It coincided with a rise in social media and represented a way for people to get their news for free.

And it wasn’t always good for journalism, Houck realizes now. 
Longer features and deeper dives faded with the rise of bite-sized news, he said, and daily newspapers took a hit. He also came to realize that digital-first practices like publishing arrest reports only partially tell the story. Oil City News no longer does that. 
“So our understanding of what it means to do it right has changed quite a bit in the 10 years that I’ve been involved with the organization,” he said. 
Oil City News also strives now not to cherry-pick coverage based on what may be “clickbait,” he said. For example, staff makes an effort to cover every item on the city council agenda, not just the controversial ones. 
With a growing team and more sophisticated approach, he said, Oil City has been feeling ready to take another step. 
“We’ve been wanting to do a newspaper for many, many years,” he said. “We saw there was a need for it in our community, and we also saw an opportunity to advertise so that we could better support reporters.”
Offline by design
Casper has a rich history of journalism. It’s home to Wyoming’s largest print newspaper, the Casper Star-Tribune, which traces back more than a century. In its heyday, the paper had a bureau in Washington, D.C, and dozens of editorial staffers. It also had a competitor: The Casper Journal, a free weekly. 
The Star-Tribune acquired the Journal in 2004 and published it until 2022, when it was discontinued. That left a hole in the local newscape, Houck said: the free, community-focused weekly. 
Houck hopes to occupy that role. Oil City Weekly intends to be 100% local — no national or even state news. From the advertising side, he added, it’s a way to expand the offering of Upslope Media. 
Wyoming news veterans like Dan Neal are happy to see the new product.

“We need local news, and that’s where Oil City is focused,” said Neal, a Casper journalist who worked at the Star-Tribune from 1981-2004. “Staff at the Star-Tribune is working hard, but, you know, they’re limited, and so I think it’s great that Oil City is going to take reporting that has already been going online, and getting it in a physical format where people could find it around town, in coffee shops and places like that.”
Competition is healthy in journalism, Neal said. It pushes outlets to be better, faster and more accurate.
Creating a new print product in this internet age can be seen as questionable. And some people warned Houck against it. But, he said, Oil City has a deep understanding of social media and digital news, and he thinks starting from that foundation will be advantageous. Plus, he really believes Casper readers will embrace Oil City Weekly. 
“It just feels right,” Houck said. 
Full circle
Oil City News churns up a lot of content for the website; the staff couldn’t possibly fit it all into the weekly paper, Houck said. To determine what goes into the print product, he said, they will follow two guiding principles. 
First, “we know there’s a lot of important news that we’re covering, primarily things like elected boards, city councils, things like that.” But, he said, internet algorithms don’t often push those stories, favoring instead more sensational headlines. So those stories will take priority — stories about school-board decisions, city development, new businesses.
“We want to provide news to the community that we think is important for them to understand and know about,” he said.

The second principle for determining content is a direct response to readers, he said, who consistently ask for event listings. With that in mind, Oil City Weekly has an extensive calendar of events designed to be pulled out for ease of use. 
Readers also want physical copies of certain types of stories, Houck said, like obituaries, marriage announcements, business stories. Those, too, will be published in the weekly.
Houck used some of his own marketing savvy for the paper’s debut. In early July, Oil City staff and friends dressed up as newsies and marched in the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo Parade in Casper, handing out fresh copies of the first edition to readers. It was fun to see the crowd’s response, he said. 
Holding the physical paper in his hands, he added, “feels awesome.” 
It also reminds him of another time. 
“It’s funny, I found my old zine,” he said. “And I put them side by side. And we’re basically doing the same thing I was doing 20-plus years ago. It’s the feature, it’s the events calendar, it’s a little bit of the cheeky attitude. It’s all those things that haven’t really changed much.”

Decade of data helps illuminate deer family dynamics, offering possible solutions to history of decline.
The post Runs in the family: Study shows most mule deer learn to migrate from moms appeared first on WyoFile .","One early summer day in 2018, in the southern end of the Wyoming Range, a mule deer doe told her 1-year-old fawn to scram. 
The young one did. But she didn’t linger around the mountain meadows where she had been born, like other yearlings kicked to the metaphorical curb by their birthing mothers. Perhaps out of a wandering spirit, or teenage petulance, F210, as she is known, went out on her own. 
Far out. 
In fact, she spent a month making a 120-mile trek out and back over mountains and through foothills in country she’d never seen. Maybe she was one of those deer paving a new migratory route, researchers thought. Or she was looking for somewhere better than where her mother and grandmother and great-grandmother trekked. 
Or maybe she was just in a mood. 
Because by mid-summer, F210 returned to her natal summer range and then in the fall walked diligently back along her mother’s migratory route to their winter range. She then spent the rest of her life making the same migration as her mom, back and forth, back and forth, never to return to that early foray. 
F210’s story joins the catalogue of narratives built by a decade of mule deer collar information in the Wyoming Range. And through millions of data points covering hundreds of deer’s lives, former University of Wyoming researcher Rhiannon Jakopak was able to uncover some truths: More than 60% of mule deer really do learn their migratory paths from their mothers.

Researchers have, for many years, believed that to be true. But it took a massive dataset following the same deer and their fawns year after year to prove the point, which also includes a caveat: Some deer don’t do what their moms tell them. 
The information, which was published earlier this month in the journal Current Biology, gives both a warning and a shred of hope for struggling mule deer numbers, said Kevin Monteith, the University of Wyoming professor who helped start the Wyoming Range project. 
Deer follow their mothers’ paths because they provide the best blueprint for survival. Lose established migratory routes, and we lose the backbone of large mule deer herds, he said. But some deer will forge on their own, and while researchers have yet to determine the success of those wayfinders, the explorers offer some promise that herds can eventually rebuild. 
A decade of data
UW researchers, along with Wyoming Game and Fish biologists, and U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management experts, began in 2013 placing collars on mule deer in the Wyoming Range as part of a larger project to understand mule deer numbers and their continued decline. The Wyoming Range herd historically numbered as high as 50,000, but the herd for years had languished at around 30,000 before the bad winter of 2022-23 plummeted the population to just over 13,000. 
Biologists, managers, hunters and outfitters blamed everything from diseases and habitat issues to harsh winters and predators. Without concrete evidence gained from years of collaring fawns and their mothers, then following up on each death, no one could really know for sure. 
So the Monteith shop began collecting that data. And it was no easy feat, Jakopak said.

Dozens of collars went out in 2015, only for the bad winter of 2017 to hit, killing most of the fawns in the study. The same scenario happened again in 2019 and again in 2023 when many of the deer in the study cohort keeled over. 
“There were so many mother-daughter pairs to start out with in the summer and by the fall only a handful were left,” Jakopak said. “And they still had to make it through the winter.”
But after a decade, researchers ended up being able to follow 16 deer and their offspring over the course of their lives. From that data, Jakopak found 11 deer adopted their moms’ routes, including some fawns who gave birth to their own offspring within yards of where they were born. But five did not follow their moms, which was maybe even more of a surprise to Jakopak. 
“We speak with such certainties with deer,” she said. “But if we’re so certain about something, we don’t leave the potential to discover what is unexpected but true.”
Hope in the wanderers
This story isn’t just about interesting mule deer family dynamics, though. The data could help biologists and land managers find a piece of the solution to declining mule deer numbers, Monteith said. 
Because now researchers know the importance of inheriting a mother’s path. Unlike elk, who will often change migratory routes based on bad weather, a new housing development, a road or an impenetrable fence, mule deer stay faithful. That faithfulness is likely a product of what the migration corridor offers, including the best access to nutritious groceries, good stopover points and an avoidance of possible threats. Once deer find those paths, they stick to them, reproducing, introducing their fawns to the routes, and passing along the secret to longevity.

If we fragment established migration routes with a subdivision, energy field, highway or tall fence, they could lose that knowledge.
The potential bright spot comes in the form of deer who don’t follow mom and instead wander off on their own, said Jill Randall, Game and Fish’s big game migration coordinator. 
If those deer find suitable alternatives, it is possible for herds to rebuild using new, less broken routes. 
“Our climate is changing, and our landscapes are changing,” Randall said. “Maybe a fact that a number of individuals in the population show that diversity and variety prove some adaptability on a population level.”
But that also means managers must look more broadly at landscapes and consider how to conserve larger swaths than just the linear migration route. Because if we want to build back our herds, Monteith said, land managers must first protect the routes that exist for deer like F210, then also consider the bigger picture.

Forcing Mike Lee to drop his public land sale proposal merits celebration, but history signals the fight is far from over, writes guest columnist Chris Madson. 
The post The assault on public lands has a long, sad history with no end in sight. appeared first on WyoFile .","So, under pressure from hundreds of thousands of Americans, Utah’s land-grabbing Sen. Mike Lee withdrew his proposal to put the nation’s public domain up for sale. Much justifiable celebration has ensued. Largely lost in the outcry over his provision in the Big Beautiful Bill Act was an announcement by Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins: The Department of Agriculture is rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule that has prohibited road construction and timbering on 58.5 million acres of national forest.

Opinion

Rollins brought her vast experience with federal lands from her home in Texas to Washington, D.C., where she served as a minor functionary in the first Trump administration and later as the co-founder of a D.C. lobbying group, America First Policy Institute. What she knows about the issues surrounding federal land use could be comfortably contained in a thimble. 
Her order was a canny political move, since it’s likely to split the constituency that voiced outrage over the outright sale of federal land. A substantial part of that opposition came from users of ATVs, snowmobiles and other vehicles designed to move people into the backcountry with minimal sweat. Many will be happy to hear a huge swath of federal land is now open to motor vehicles.
Even more will be alarmed. Backpackers and other wilderness aficionados prefer their forests roadless. So do many big game hunters, since elk, mule deer and bighorn sheep shy away from roads, even the seldom-used two-tracks that wind their way through the public domain. The first step in planning a big-game hunt on federal land is to spread out a map and look for the places the roads don’t go — those are the places big game is likely to be found, especially after the opening morning of the season.
I mention this proposal for a couple of reasons. First, if it isn’t quickly rescinded, it will have dire consequences for those of us who prefer to maintain some places only a horse or boot leather can take us. Over decades of debate, we’ve struck a balance between motorized access on national forests and the unique character of true backcountry. I’m not surprised that a president whose idea of wilderness is the rough on a golf course appointed a woman who comes from one of the most fenced-in, jealously guarded, privately held states in the nation to oversee a system of federal lands that is a powerful symbol of freedom for tens of millions of Americans. Not surprised, just deeply disappointed. 
The second reason I raise this matter is to consider the way it fits in the fight over federal land, a fight that started almost as soon as Yellowstone, the nation’s first national park, was set aside in 1872. In the years that followed that unprecedented action, powerful economic interests in the West started a campaign to get control of the park, maneuvering to build a rail line in Montana from Gardiner to Cooke City, slicing off the northern and western edges of the park in the process. One of the park’s first superintendents, Robert E. Carpenter, was fired when his part in the scheme came to light.
In 1891, President Benjamin Harrison created America’s first forest reserve, a huge tract of high-country timber east of Yellowstone Park that would eventually become the Shoshone National Forest. At first, residents ignored the regulations intended to protect timber, pasture and watersheds from senseless abuse. Then, as the regulations were enforced, the locals pressed their representatives in Washington, D.C., for relief. Several congressmen from the West took up that cause, which was eventually adopted by Speaker of the House Joe Cannon of Illinois.
In 1907, the western anti-forest coalition managed to attach an amendment to a large agriculture appropriations bill. It appropriated $125,000 for the Forest Service, provided: “that hereafter no forest reserve shall be created, nor shall any additions be made to one heretofore created within the limits of the States of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, or Wyoming, except by Act of Congress.” The identities of the authors of this provision are lost in the minutiae of congressional records, but the list of states it was supposed to protect from President Teddy Roosevelt’s ongoing campaign to establish national forests tells us where they lived.
While this contest was simmering in Washington, westerners fought federal authority on the ground. In 1906, rancher Fred Light turned 500 head of cattle loose on the Holy Cross Forest Reserve in Colorado without a permit from the Forest Service. The resulting legal battle went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, funded by a special appropriation from the Colorado Legislature. A similar case in California also made its way to the Supreme Court. The ranchers lost their bid to undermine Forest Service regulations — the court supported congressional authority to establish federal reserves and appoint officials to control the ways they’re used.
Supreme Court decisions notwithstanding, stockgrowers and settlers near the public domain continued to flout regulations and dodge limited enforcement, and the damage to federal land deepened and widened. In 1923, Aldo Leopold, then an assistant Forest Service supervisor in the department’s Southwest region, reported that, on the forests in his district, “overgrazing is responsible for much more abnormal erosion than all other causes combined.” 
The situation worsened as the region descended into the droughts of the 1930s, which led conservation-minded legislators to impose some sort of reasonable management on federal lands, especially the parts of the public domain that were neither part of the national systems of parks and forests nor owned by private interests. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 allowed the secretary of the interior to organize “grazing districts” on those orphan federal lands, issue permits to control grazing and charge a fee for those permits. Oddly enough, the sponsor of the law, Congressman Edward Taylor of Colorado, was an opponent of federal controls and hoped to give locals control over the new federal grazing bureau.
One of the most entrenched opponents of the Taylor Grazing Act was Pat McCarran, U.S. senator from Nevada. When the act took effect, McCarran set about undermining the new federal Grazing Service. He set standards for the election of local advisory boards that favored the biggest ranchers; he made sure the boards could set grazing fees well below prevailing market prices; he pushed regulatory loopholes that favored ranches controlled by banks and he pressed board members to buy their grazing districts outright. Over the next 20 years, he attacked Grazing Service employees for alleged abuses of authority and fought proposals to increase grazing fees. He was his generation’s leader in a war against federal land that was already 50 years old. 
After World War II, U.S. Sen. Ed Robertson from Wyoming took up the cause, introducing a bill that would have turned over federal grazing lands to the states in which they were found and holding extensive “investigative hearings” across the West to root out instances of Bureau of Land Management (formerly the Grazing Services) employees abusing their authority. He pressured the Department of Agriculture to maintain unsustainable stocking rates for sheep and cattle on national forests and helped strangle BLM efforts by slashing the agency’s budget. Other members of Congress championed laws that expanded assistance to permittees grazing public land and limited BLM and Forest Service professionals’ authority to regulate grazing. Frank Barrett, a Wyoming senator, introduced a bill that would have allowed permittees to sell their permits. Thankfully, it failed. At the same time, timber harvests on federal land expanded drastically, with no attention given to restrictions explicit in the federal laws that were supposed to control the Forest Service. 
Through the 1960s and 1970s, the American public at large reacted to the longstanding hegemony local interests had exercised over federal lands. The Wilderness Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and other federal laws sought to protect amenities the nation at large valued, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 kept BLM lands in federal hands while mandating management that considered “the long-term needs of future generations for natural scenic, scientific and historical values” as well as “recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish.” All of this was to be done “without permanent impairments of the land and the quality of the environment.”
The Federal Land Policy and Management Act was a glove in the face of the traditional masters of the public domain, and it elicited a response that came to be known as the Sagebrush Rebellion, yet another attempt to cede federal land to the states. Prominent in the movement at that moment were candidate Ronald Reagan and Orrin Hatch, U.S. senator from Utah.
This brings us into the realm of living memory. Following the Sagebrush Rebellion, Cliven Bundy and his son, Ammon, dared the federal government to enforce its regulations concerning the use of public land. Ammon was found not guilty of occupying a national wildlife refuge at gunpoint, and, after 10 years, Cliven is still grazing his stock illegally on BLM land. 
And now comes Mike Lee at the head of the most recent insurgent action in a fight that has stretched on for 140 years. Should anyone mistake his intentions after his land sale provision was taken off the table, he said that he “continues to believe the federal government owns far too much land — land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation. Massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there.” He promised to continue his efforts to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.” We have a century of abuse of the public domain by a tiny minority of people to help us define what he means by “work” and “American families.” 
Forcing Lee and his cronies to back down was a signal victory, well worth celebrating. So find a friend, face your favorite corner of public land, the place that always brings a smile to your face and raise a libation to success. Then get a good night’s sleep. Tomorrow morning, they’ll be at it again.

Among the responses, lawmakers described the 2025 session as a “mixed bag,” “very successful,” “deeply disappointing,” “highly productive” or “decent.” Some early priorities identified for 2026 include the state budget, property taxes and economic development.
While the Legislature will conduct interim studies and hold hearings this summer and fall, official action is on pause — at least for a while — after state lawmakers adjourned June 2. No plans have been announced for a special session. Some laws took effect immediately during the session. Others will be enacted this fall, most on Sept. 3, or later on.
Lawmakers are expected to return for the 2026 session beginning Jan. 7.

(Fayette County Public Schools)At a Fayette County School Board meeting in April, Lamar Hobson decided he’d had enough.
He had unanswered questions about the school system’s proposed budget, which was being put together without the involvement of a finance director. The district has been without one for several months.
Before he could start speaking during public comment, Board Chair Warner Speakman cut him off. “I’m gonna ask you. Are you from this county? … Do you vote here?”
“You go up to the courthouse and check. I’m on the register,” Hobson, a 1981 graduate of Fayette-Ware High School, said before turning to Board Member Becky Trimm. “I sent you an email this morning. I’m in your district. You ain’t never spoke to me. Not one time.”
Speakman waved a Sheriff’s deputy toward the front of the room as Hobson turned to address a cheering audience.
“The board shows that they are not for us … They’re supposed to be representing us — the people — not a certain … hidden agenda,” Hobson shouted. 
Speakman banged the gavel.
Tension has been palpable between the crowd and the school board this year, though Speakman told Tennessee Lookout that “there has been ‘no’ friction” after he read aloud a letter from the Sheriff’s Office concerning rules for crowd decorum at a June meeting.
This atmosphere comes as the board continues to push toward dissolving the consent decree that has held the school system accountable to the federal government for integrating public schools since 1965. The order was put in place after the government found that Fayette County failed to appropriately desegregate its schools.

By 2023, the school system had worked to eliminate discrimination in staffing, facilities, transportation and extracurricular activities, according to an order from U.S. District Court Judge S. Thomas Anderson.
In recognition of the district’s progress, Anderson approved a new consent decree in October 2023 that restricts desegregation obligations to a few remaining areas. This order requires the district to improve its efforts to recruit and retain diverse faculty, revise discipline policies to prevent racial discrimination and better identify and serve students through gifted programs and dual-enrollment classes, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
It also requires the district to hold parent information and listening sessions multiple times each year and “listen and respond to questions, comments and concerns.”
Repeated comments from Hobson and other community members who attend school board meetings indicate a lack of trust in the school board’s decision-making processes and consideration of public feedback.
The majority of attendees at many of the board’s meetings are Black, mirroring the demographics of the school system itself. Nearly 55% of the school system’s 3,283 students in the 2020-2021 school year were Black, according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection Office.
Six of the eight sitting school board members are white.
Continued scrutiny over minority representation
In February, the board voted to declare unitary status, asserting that federal monitoring is no longer necessary and the school system’s difficulties with representation are in the past. For that decision to take effect, either the plaintiffs – including the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund – would have to agree that the district implemented the order in good faith, or the court would need to schedule an evidentiary hearing to determine the district’s compliance.
Fayette County School District has continued to file the required reports so its “progress toward a unitary system can be monitored,” court records show. The district has not filed a motion for declaration of full unitary status and case dismissal.
In multiple social media posts, Speakman states that ending the ongoing desegregation case is among his top priorities. He said the case and its requirements are costing the district money that could be better used elsewhere.
NAACP dismisses discrimination suit against Fayette County after commission passes new district map

Some community members responded to the school board’s vote with apprehension that removing federal accountability could lead to a backslide in progress.
Fayette County has continued to fall under scrutiny for issues of discrimination in recent years. The U.S. Department of Justice and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund separately sued the county earlier this year over its 2021 electoral map, which the lawsuits said illegally diluted the power of Black voters to elect candidates of their choice. 
Both of the lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed after the county commission approved a new electoral map with three majority-Black, single-member districts in late June. The new map will be used in the 2026 election cycle.
Sitting school board member David Reeves drafted a letter to U.S. Rep. David Kustoff in April, asking the Memphis Republican to “(engage) the Department of Justice” to help Fayette County Public Schools end the consent decree. 
Tennessee Lookout obtained the letter through a public records request that was initially denied by the board’s legal counsel. The letter was never shared with the public despite being reviewed by at least one other board member.

Letter to Congress 
Using Fayette County Public Schools letterhead, Reeves wrote that the district has made “significant progress” in the decades since the case began.
“The ongoing legal oversight poses a considerable obstacle to our mission,” Reeves wrote. “The constraints imposed by the case restrict our operational flexibility, limiting our ability to make decisions best suited to the current needs of our community.”
Reeves signed the letter using his school board title. Legal counsel stated that Reeves was not authorized to write the letter as a representative of the school board and acted without the board’s permission.
It’s not clear if Reeves sent the letter. Reeves did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Representatives for Kustoff did not respond to questions about the letter.
‘They shut (discussion) down’
Latoya Parker, who describes herself as a teachers’ advocate, started attending school board meetings in person in May. Like Hobson, she described the board’s function as a “hidden agenda.”
She said the board votes on big items — like the budget, which was ultimately approved this summer — without much discussion at the full board meeting. 
“When something is going to have to come out, they shut (discussion) down,” Parker said.
Multiple public speakers over the course of several meetings said board members failed to respond to or acknowledge emails from constituents.
Tennessee Lookout reached out to the eight sitting board members via email. Kevin Powers, a former Fayette County commissioner who was appointed by the County Commission to fill a vacancy on the board in May, declined to comment, citing his short time in the seat. Speakman also responded, referencing the Sheriff’s Office letter and declining to comment further. The remaining six members did not respond.

School board members have made some steps toward building a relationship with the community.
Parker said the board’s responses to public comment at a meeting on June 5 were markedly different from the norm. Board members said they had taken down a list of questions voiced by speakers during public comment. One board member suggested the board review rules of order to improve how meetings are run. The suggestion drew applause from the audience.
NAACP Fayette-Somerville Branch President Elton Holmes frequently attends and speaks at meetings. In early July, he entreated the board and newly selected Superintendent Don McPherson to create a policy for answering questions from community members.
“The only way we’re going to be able to work together is we’re gonna have to communicate,” Holmes said at a July 2 meeting. “By giving the answers to the questions … it probably will cut down on some of the animosity that the constituents have right now for the school board.”
At a committee meeting on July 22, Powers said he is “fully in favor” of creating a policy regarding addressing public comments.
“There’s nothing worse than putting up your thoughts about something and then having it look like, eh, we don’t care what’s going on. We do,” he said, asking community members to email all board members their ideas for such a policy.
Speakman echoed Powers as he closed the meeting.
“Anything that you have that you’d like to see, just let us know,” Speakman said. 
Hobson said he keeps speaking at meetings because he feels the board isn’t listening.
“Somebody has to step up and put a voice out there and let the people in the community know that you’ve got a voice,” he said. “All you got to do is come together … and protest this. This is not right.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Gov. Jared Polis wants Colorado to fast-track deployment of new clean energy projects before Republicans’ rollback of billions of dollars in incentives takes effect.
In an executive order signed Friday, Polis directed state agencies to take a variety of steps to “eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks for renewable projects,” citing a “time-limited window for procurement of tax-advantaged wind and solar” before Biden-era credits and rebates are phased out by the congressional GOP’s recent domestic policy bill.
“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon,” Polis said. “We continue to do all we can to make people aware of how you can reduce costs on energy bills and keep money in your pocket.”

The state’s goal, Polis’ order says, is to “integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible.” That could include expedited reviews of new projects by the Public Utilities Commission and invoking the agency’s authority to override local permit denials, as well as “priority air permitting” for electricity generation projects by the state’s Air Pollution Control Division.
Most of the clean energy incentives enacted by Democrats in 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act are set to be quickly phased out under the megabill passed by Republicans and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. Tax credits for utility-scale wind and solar projects will expire for any project not placed into service by the end of 2027. Many consumer-facing incentives will expire much sooner than that, with electric vehicle rebates expiring next month and a credit for home energy upgrades due to end Dec. 31 of this year.
The state has launched an online “energy savings navigator” tool that allows Coloradans to learn what incentives they may be eligible for based on their ZIP code, income level and other factors.
$500 extra a year per household
Officials from the Colorado Energy Office told lawmakers last week that the Republican bill, also known as H.R. 1, will slow the state’s efforts to deploy electric vehicles, heat pumps and other clean-energy technologies. Colorado was already in jeopardy of falling short of its statutory goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, projections showed.
“The state can certainly work to ensure that Coloradans are aware of these credits and are able to take advantage of them as much as they can,” CEO deputy director Dominique Gómez told lawmakers. “But there are obviously some limitations given how quickly these credits are expiring.”
The state now projects fewer than 600,000 electric vehicles will be on Colorado’s roads by 2030, far short of the goal of nearly 1 million it first set in 2019, according to a slide shown to lawmakers.
Colorado’s plans to clean up the electricity sector, however, may be relatively unaffected by the Republican bill — aside from higher costs for utilities and ratepayers.
“While this does likely increase the cost for new wind and solar, it is likely that compared to other new generation sources, this is still the quickest to market, and in many cases, still the most cost-effective new generation source,” Gómez said. “It is difficult for us to say at this point whether or not it will really change the overall trajectory, but we do know that it will make it more expensive.”
Polis’ office claimed Friday that the energy policies enacted by Republicans are projected to cost the average Colorado household $500 a year by 2035.
“Colorado’s swift response to the devastating impacts of H.R. 1 shows true leadership at a critical moment for our economy and clean energy goals,” Emilie Olson, Colorado lead at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United, said in a press release. “We don’t need to wait on the federal government to make progress on the clean energy future that our state leaders have committed to.”

Jeff Landry has declared a state emergency to address what he said is lack of capacity to house violent offenders at Louisiana State Penitentiary. His proclamation allows state officials to expedite repairs at a section of the Angola prison that was shut down eight years ago for security reasons.
The governor’s emergency declaration clears the way for his office to expedite resources and personnel for Camp J, comprising four maximum-security buildings on the sprawling 18,000-acre prison grounds. Once known as the “Dungeon,” most of its cells were designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons.
Warden Darryl Vanoy closed Camp J in 2017 after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were found inside, and approximately 85 correctional officers resigned, retired or were fired as a result of its conditions.
Despite its closure, a portion of Camp J was used as a quarantine site for incarcerated people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Landry’s emergency order suspends state procurement code and public bid law for the state to secure any goods and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency. 
The governor signed the declaration July 25, but news of his action only became known over the weekend. The state of emergency remains in effect through Aug. 23.
There were 4,240 people incarcerated at Angola as of May 31, the most recent state figures available, and 91.5% of them were violent offenders. 
There were more than 29,000 people in state custody across Louisiana, with 55% at nine state prisons. The other 45% are held in local jails where they’re either serving shorter sentences, awaiting transfer to a state facility or nearing the end of their incarceration. 
Violent offenders accounted for 56% of the state prisoner total at the end of May.

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th.  Meet Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Measles is spreading in the United States, and so is the risk of exposure and infection at child care facilities, which often serve kids too young to be vaccinated against the highly contagious disease.
Children’s health is the most immediate challenge amid an exposure, but not the only one. Parents may face three weeks of quarantine that requires them to keep their child at home, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to work without reliable child care.
A mother in Iowa is highlighting just how complicated things can get. Martha Martin has been posting on social media about the ripple effects after a person who visited her 9-month-old son’s day care in Cedar Rapids later tested positive for the illness. The individual was vaccinated and is among seven cases of measles in Iowa as of July 15. Not all of the infections appear to be connected.
It took public health officials several days to notify the day care of the exposure, but Martin’s son — who had not yet received his first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine because of his age — was able to receive a post-exposure antibody known as immunoglobulin. The alert came too late for her son to get an emergency MMR shot, which can be available within 72 hours of exposure.
Martin said she and her husband took their son to an emergency room for the antibody treatment, and she has received some mixed messaging about whether the couple will be on the hook to pay out of pocket. Other children from the day care were given immunoglobulin shots through a clinic organized by UnityPoint Health – St. Luke’s Hospital and the local county public health department. A spokesperson for the hospital system confirmed those details but did not respond to questions about the cost of the shots.
“Day cares can be a terrible place to have a measles outbreak,” said Dr. Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious diseases physician and president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “There’s going to be babies there that are too young to receive a measles vaccine. And they are at very high risk, if they get measles, to get a severe case.”
The state of Iowa has a 21-day measles quarantine protocol for non-immune people, a typical period in part because of how long a person may be able to spread the disease. But Martin said the day care instructed the couple to keep their son at home for 28 days because the antibody extends that period.
“I’m not sure what we’re going to do about that, not sure what we’re going to do about me going to work, my husband, everything like that,” Martin said in one post on TikTok that has now been viewed 2.5 million times.
Martin initially responded to an interview request from The 19th but later stopped communication.
A senior staff member who answered a call at the Iowa day care directed inquiries to local and state public health officials. A spokesperson for the public health department in Linn County, Iowa, said it continues to monitor the day care and other places of exposure as needed after “hours and hours” of contact tracing. A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the day care is open and highlighted its protocol document.
Martin said her son appears to be fine for now, but she knows symptoms can take some time to emerge. She said while her employer has been understanding, she will use vacation days and her husband will take unpaid time off to care for their son. Throughout her posts, Martin hammered one point a few times.
“Get your kids vaccinated,” she said, adding: “Your kids, you yourself not getting vaccinated — you are harming everybody else.”
In late March, a measles outbreak in West Texas reached a day care in Lubbock, where a child with measles infected several children, according to news reports. Some parents were told to keep their kids at home for 21 days of quarantine.
A representative for the Texas day care did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but its co-owner told a local news outlet that the facility took a mix of precautions in order to keep its doors open. That meant sending some children home and isolating vulnerable children into a classroom while they still attended day care.
“Sending an infant home for 21 days is a huge burden on working families so there was the need to balance risk of exposure vs the need for income,” said Katherine Wells, director of the Lubbock Health Department, in an email.
America’s child care system runs under different levels of regulations, with varying rules by state when it comes to handling infectious disease outbreaks.
Ruth Friedman is a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and former director of the Federal Office of Child Care (OCC). She said day cares work under tight financial margins, and infectious diseases like measles could be a major financial blow, a dynamic that has parallels to the COVID-19 pandemic when some centers had to reduce services or close.
“If you destabilize the attendance and enrollment of children in child care, it can very quickly lead to programs closing their doors and child care broadly becoming unavailable to a community,” she said.
Wells said some parents expressed anger about their child being quarantined, while others said they were simply fearful about their children being exposed to the disease, which can make people very sick: complications include pneumonia, brain swelling and death. Children under 5 and pregnant people are among those more likely to suffer complications. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people with measles are hospitalized.
The first MMR shot is typically administered to a child between 12 and 15 months of age, with a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6. Children between 6 months old and a year are eligible for an earlier shot if they live in or travel to an outbreak area or are traveling internationally.
Iowa health officials have begun to recommend that parents consider an accelerated shot schedule for their children, which can include receiving the second MMR shot as early as 28 days after the first dose. Two doses are 97%  effective against measles, which is at a 30-year high around the country.
The risk of measles at day cares is not new. Between December 2023 and January 2024, a day care in Philadelphia reported an outbreak that spread in part because a parent sent a quarantined child to day care despite knowing the child, who was not vaccinated, had been exposed to measles. The child, as well as the parent, later tested positive for measles.
Dr. Ericka Hayes, an attending physician and senior medical director of infection prevention at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the chances of more outbreaks in child care settings will depend on factors like vaccination rates within the facility and how it adheres to its policies around illness. She noted that children are contagious with measles for several days prior to the onset of a rash — often a primary symptom — but other early signs of infection can look a lot like a common viral infection: fever, cough, runny nose, and red and watery eyes.
“So equally important is if a child is sick they should be excluded from day care,” she said via email.
Friedman said the case out of Philadelphia previews a potential conflict that could emerge as parents reckon with health considerations amid work responsibilities that ensure they can pay their daily and monthly expenses. Federal law does not require employers to offer paid sick leave to its workers, leaving such options up to states. In some cases, states are rescinding those policies despite voters’ wishes.
“There’s this tension — what are you supposed to do with your child if you need to work?” she said. “From a family perspective and from a child care sector perspective, I think the implications could potentially be really, really troubling.”

My first car was one of those pollution machines, a used 1968 Buick Gran Sport that gulped a gallon of poisonous, leaded gasoline every 14 miles or so.
It was a different time, one that the Trump administration seemingly is trying to bring back.
In what could be one of the most far-reaching deregulatory moves in U.S. history, the Environmental Protection Agency wants to stop regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks long considered by most scientists to be significant contributors to climate change.
“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Kenworth heavy truck dealership in Indianapolis on July 29.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Zeldin said the administration plans to overturn a landmark 2009 finding by the Obama administration that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants the agency can regulate under the Clean Air Act.
That determination is known as the “endangerment finding” and was the basis for strict tailpipe emission rules enacted by the Biden administration that would have required about half of new vehicles sold in the U.S. being electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030.
Automakers also must meet certain fuel economy standards, which were stiffened by Biden. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in June the Trump administration is planning to roll back the Biden standards, calling them “illegal.”
And under the One Big Beautiful Bill, the tax and spending bill approved by Congress on July 3, automakers won’t have to pay fines for not meeting fuel economy standards for the past three years.
It’s a big gift to automakers that pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the federal government for not meeting the fuel economy standards. But it will likely sting electric carmaker Tesla, which has made billions of dollars over the years selling regulatory credits to other carmakers.
Environmental groups expressed outrage over the EPA’s intent to deep-six climate rules.
“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare.”
Environmental groups have vowed to sue the EPA over the proposed climate rules rollback, possibly delaying any implementation for years.
Even Detroit’s automakers were muffled in their response to the EPA’s move to ditch carbon dioxide rules.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association representing dozens of automakers and suppliers including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis N.A., did not issue a statement about the EPA’s groundbreaking announcement on its website.
That might be because some top auto executives have acknowledged climate change is real and their products are contributing to it.
GM CEO Mary Barra has said electric cars are a key element in the automaker’s long-range plan to have “zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It’s the North Star that guides everything we do.”
Ford Motor Executive Chairman Bill Ford has supported the Paris Climate Accord, which seeks to reduce carbon dioxide levels associated with climate change. Ford Motor also has pledged to be carbon neutral across its vehicles, facilities and suppliers by 2050.
Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are doing their best to torpedo those efforts by conducting an all-out war against electric vehicles.
They’re ending the $7,500 tax credit to purchase EVs on September 30. And they’re eliminating tax credits for home EV charging stations, a move slated to take effect next June.
Trump’s chaotic implementation of tariffs also is being used as a weapon in his war against EVs. The Commerce Department last month slapped a 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite, a critical ingredient in manufacturing EV batteries.
China supplies nearly all the high-grade graphite Tesla and other automakers need to make batteries. But the Commerce Department says China is “dumping” graphite into the U.S. at prices lower than in its home market.
Some experts say the tariff could add $1,000 or more to the price of an EV battery, another huge disincentive for consumers to buy EVs.
Trump’s widespread tariffs on cars, trucks and parts are hammering Detroit automakers’ bottom lines, potentially hurting their ability to adequately invest in new technologies to compete with Chinese automakers that are rapidly gobbling up the global EV market.
Ford and Stellantis cited the impacts of tariffs in the companies’ net losses for the second quarter of the year. Combined, the Detroit Three have paid more than $2 billion in tariffs so far this year.
Trump longs to return to an America he remembers growing up before the federal government started regulating the auto industry.
I’m nostalgic, as well, for my ’68 Gran Sport. But that muscle car is an anachronism best suited for events like the Woodward Dream Cruise.
And besides, today’s quick-accelerating EVs could blow its doors off.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/799px-interstate_270-11644335642.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 06:56:17.137012

(Photo: Getty Images)Across the state, from Memphis to Johnson City, educators are emerging from their summer sabbatical, slogging their way through teacher in-service and counting the hours until they can do what they really want to do: teach students. 
Over the last quarter-century, however, the bureaucracy surrounding public education has substantially increased. From testing mandates to false flags surrounding equitable teaching and learning, classroom teachers have shouldered the burden of navigating the landmines of performative legislation (CRT, Success Sequence, Gun Safety), all while doing their best to ensure students are emotionally, mentally and physically safe to learn subject-specific content. 
Looking beyond the frivolous legislation previously mentioned, the glaring albatross that has been weighing teachers down for nearly two decades is standardized testing. 
Assessing students on one single day of a 180-day year and using that data to determine the success of a student, a teacher, a school, and a district is inarguably flawed. However, like anything that has been in place for 20 years, a habituation occurs — the worst ideas can eventually become acceptable over time.
Recently, the formula used to determine the “success” of a school and or district was changed to place more weight on academic achievement rather than academic growth. 
Without diving too deep into the weeds of data correlation, the success rates of achievement on standardized tests don’t necessarily reflect students’ abilities; instead, those success rates are directly linked to the socioeconomic status of schools and districts.  The wealthier the district, the higher the achievement. The inverse is also true: the poorer the district, the lower the achievement. While the sole measure of student success based on testing is bad enough, weaponizing that data is worse.
Tennessee governor bets big on school vouchers with primary endorsements. Will it work?

Six years ago, Gov. Bill Lee made his first move to introduce educational choice (emphasis on charter schools and private school vouchers) to Tennessee. Using districts with the lowest performance rates as voucher guinea pigs, some GOP state legislators (potentially aided by some suspect back-door deals by former House Speaker Glen Casada) introduced voucher programs into Memphis-Shelby County Schools and Metro Nashville Public Schools That opened the door to the eventual implementation of a state-wide voucher program known as “Tennessee Education Freedom,” which passed in a January special legislative session.
Ironically for teachers and students remaining in public education, teaching and learning are anything but liberated. Educators are inextricably handcuffed to testing and the data mined from it. Since 2019, the state of Tennessee has paid nearly $150 million to the testing vendor Pearson for test materials, scoring, and data organization. When millions of dollars are given to a testing company, the practice of teaching systematically bends to the will of a test’s format — In this case, multiple choice. 
Lost in the pressured pursuit of gaming the data, schools and teachers have fallen victim to assessing students in a way that hinders learning exploration, limits opportunities for creativity, and transforms learning as an evolving journey into a finite outcome of selecting one choice out of four. Every. Single. Time.
But who can blame schools or teachers for gaming the system? These are the rules of the game we’ve been given to play. If we fail to meet the data checkpoints set by the state and federal government, we risk losing funding. If our students don’t answer a certain number of questions correctly on one given test on a given day, a public grade of “F” could be assigned to the school. Public education has been painted into a corner by the corrosive legislation of testing and then, in the cruelest of turns, had that same data weaponized against it as an argument for school choice. 
However, there’s a faint light at the end of this testing tunnel.
During the last legislative session, a measure was introducted to help rectify the testing mess. were introduced. As enacted, House and Senate  bills allow for the creation of an advisory committee to study various aspects of public education in Tennessee, including the methods and frequency of standardized testing. The formation of this committee is the first step in abolishing the toxic culture of standardized testing within public education.
Rarely have I been on board with legislation introduced by Tennessee Republicans. This is an exception. During a time when it’s increasingly difficult to find common ground within a fractured political culture, this specific subject could be what brings bi-partisanship to the foreground. 
As last year’s legislative session came to a close, there was discussion of ending all state-standardized testing in high school and limiting the subjects tested in middle school. 
If that train of thought continues to roll through the advisory committee and into next year’s session, then Tennessee might finally be on its way to living up to the moniker of “education freedom.” 
We all deserve the freedom to teach and learn outside the shadows of high-stakes testing. It’s past time that we make our voices heard.

(Payton Mandell for West Virginia Watch)MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — On a turf field in Morgantown, West Virginia, last week, mine rescue teams from across the state put their training to use as they worked together to respond to simulated hazards that can occur in coal mines as part of the National Mine Rescue Association’s Post 5 Mine Rescue Contest.
The hazards, according to Josh Brady, include what to do if there is an unstable structure, water flooding a mine, a methane bubble or areas with low oxygen — all things that threaten miners’ safety while underground and can, potentially, cost them their lives. 
Mine rescue teams are the ones called in when things go wrong in a mine, said Brady, who is the director of the department of Mining and Industrial Extension at West Virginia University. 
Usually, these situations are clear and the danger they pose apparent. Having individuals trained to correct them, Brady said, means lives are saved and disasters avoided.
Nearby, in the parking lot of the Hazel & J.W. Ruby Community Center at Mylan Park, a different kind of team was working to help miners stay safe from a less obvious but just as dangerous threat: black lung. 
Employees with the National Institute for Occupational Safety were there staffing the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program’s mobile black lung screening unit. It’s the first time the mobile unit has been back in the field since federal government cuts shut it down earlier this year.
Now, following a court mandate ordering the full restoration of services at the CWHSP, Laura Reynolds, the supervisory programs management officer with the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, said everything is back to normal.
“It did take some time — first to stop everything [in April] and then, you know, getting everything back going again,” Reynolds said. “But we’re fully operational again now. Everything is staffed, we’ve got the mobile unit going, and we’re just happy to be back in the community meeting miners where they are.” 
The mobile black lung screening unit provides miners with free screenings to test their lung function and see if there is evidence of black lung. Screenings take roughly 30 minutes per person and include a health and work history questionnaire, a chest X-ray, a blood pressure screening and a spirometry test.
It takes about five people to staff the unit — one to drive and four others who run the tests and see miners.
Joene Patterson, a health technician at NIOSH who works on the unit, said being able to take services to miners directly is critical.
“For a lot of folks, too many, this might be the only time they really come and get their health checked,” Patterson said. “You know, people — men especially — can be stubborn about their health. They don’t think that something bad will happen to them, but we know it does.” 
The screenings are fully confidential and available to both current and retired miners. Reynolds said the check-ins allow miners to make up their own minds about what they want to do depending on the results. There aren’t any mandates that stop someone from working if they do have black lung, but knowing the diagnosis allows them to have options.
“It’s about giving them choices, making sure they’re aware of their health and any risks they might be taking,” Reynolds said. “We aren’t here to force anyone to do anything, but we want to make sure that they’re being educated about what could happen and their own risk level.”
If a current miner shows a positive black lung X-ray, then they can apply for a Part 90 transfer, which allows them to move to a less dusty part of the mine without facing retribution — like a cut in pay or hours — from employers.
For retired miners, the X-rays can be used to apply for black lung benefit payments.
Over the course of three days last week, Reynolds said the mobile unit saw dozens of miners.
“A few people told us they were happy to see us back out here and that was great to hear,” Reynolds said. “We’re happy anytime anyone comes in and decides to get checked out.”

The screenings are critical for early detection of black lung disease. The earlier a case is caught, the more steps people can take to prevent the disease from evolving into a more complicated and debilitating form.
There is no cure for black lung. The best intervention, according to experts, is to limit exposure to dangerous silica dust. 
But limiting that exposure is becoming difficult as dust is more common in mines now due to miners needing to dig through silica-rich sandstone to reach the little coal that remains in existing seams.
In central Appalachia, black lung rates are on the rise; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners here are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. 
One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
The resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to the increased exposure to silica dust.
Jennifer Orrahood, who also works on the mobile unit, said they’re seeing these statistics in real life all the time. It’s difficult, however, since younger coal miners tend to be more resistant to getting screened, Reynolds said.
“They tend not to worry about it, and I guess that’s part of being young,” Reynolds said.
Orrahood said she wants young miners to understand that they aren’t invincible. Risks exist and, if nothing else, it’s important to be knowledgeable about your own health.
“If you’re young, even if you believe you’re totally healthy you should still be getting screened to set a baseline,” Orrahood said. “We hope they’re right, that there’s nothing wrong, but that baseline is critical for knowing that’s the case.”

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories in your inbox every week.
For more than half a century, Diana Skarphol’s family received a check every month from the company that drilled the first successful oil well in North Dakota on their land in 1951.
The checks, from the company that became Hess Corp., were straightforward. Her family, which owns the oil and gas underground, received a percentage of the revenue generated from the company’s sale of the minerals, called a royalty.
But in April 2015, when she opened that month’s check and looked at the accompanying statement detailing her share, she noticed for the first time that a significant portion of the payment had been deducted. About 35% of what she thought she was owed was gone, and she didn’t know why. 
She was so taken aback that she called her husband, Bob Skarphol, a state lawmaker on the verge of retirement, as he drove from the Capitol in Bismarck to their home in Tioga, a small community in the oil-rich Bakken in the western part of the state. 
“Why are there minuses?” Diana Skarphol recalls asking. “Rather than being added in, things were being subtracted. I was puzzled and confused.”
The couple remembers that call because it was the start of a frustrating, decade-long search for answers from the company and of a string of unanswered pleas for help from the state, which has not taken action to help royalty recipients even as other states have. Over the past decade, Hess has withheld about 31%, or $137,635, of the Skarphols’ royalty income to cover the company’s costs to move oil and gas from the well site to market, records show. 
Oil and gas companies owed the state’s private mineral owners, like the Skarphols, an estimated $4.6 billion in 2023 before deductions, according to North Dakota State University research. But those deductions — which can vary greatly — are deeply contentious in the state: The companies claim certain costs should be shared with royalty owners, while owners say that in most circumstances, the deductions shouldn’t be permitted at all. The state itself doesn’t regulate what can be deducted and there is no official accounting of how much of that money is withheld.
The North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica spoke with 18 mineral owners, interviewed experts and lawmakers, and reviewed court records and royalty statements to understand the extent of deductions. A dozen owners provided records of companies withholding 20% or more of their oil and gas royalties. Some monthly statements showed deductions as high as 50%. Similarly, at least one energy company and one independent researcher have found the deductions to be around 20% in recent years. 
The industry’s chief lobbyist said percentages that high are atypical. Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said it would be “impossible” to calculate an average deduction but suggested it couldn’t be more than 7% to 10% based on the cost of transporting oil out of state. If deductions were in that range, North Dakota royalty owners collectively would have lost between $322 million and $460 million in 2023.
The Skarphols’ leases with Hess were signed during a time when oil and gas was often sold at or near well sites. The leases didn’t say anything about deductions. 
“It’s a matter of fairness,” Diana Skarphol said. “We didn’t get any say in it. They just up and changed it. You feel like you’re being cheated. It’s not right.”

While the language in the leases has not changed, the industry has. Most companies now choose to move the commodities away from the well site before selling them, incurring additional transportation and processing costs. They pass on a share of those costs to the royalty owners, which the North Dakota Supreme Court has ruled is legal.
By contrast, North Dakota officials have taken steps to safeguard state-owned royalties. Since 1979, all state leases with oil and gas companies prohibit deductions. When state trustees noticed deductions were being taken anyway, they fought back and have spent years negotiating settlements to recoup those missing royalties. 
But the majority of the oil and gas in North Dakota is privately owned by about 300,000 individuals, according to the industry. And North Dakota policymakers have not taken action that would protect private minerals, an investigation by the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica has found. 
“There’s a double standard,” said Rep. Keith Kempenich, a Republican from Bowman, a community in the oil field. He has co-sponsored several pieces of unsuccessful legislation aimed at helping private owners.
Lawmakers have rejected efforts to rein in deductions and to make it easier for royalty owners to understand what costs are being deducted and why. And oil and gas regulators have claimed they have no jurisdiction to help. 
“It’s ridiculous,” said Bob Skarphol, who has led the advocacy efforts by private mineral owners. “The industry has an incredible amount of influence in North Dakota.”
The state, which owns about 6% of the minerals in North Dakota, has advantages that private mineral owners don’t have. It has the resources to audit companies that pay royalties and to litigate disputes. State law also requires that companies provide electronic copies of royalty and production data to regulators, but private royalty owners are guaranteed access only if they travel to the company’s office, which could be out of state. 
And unlike the state, private mineral owners rarely have the leverage to negotiate a lease that prohibits deductions, and leases don’t expire unless oil production lapses. 
In responses to questions from the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica, officials from three companies that operate in North Dakota — Hess Corp., Slawson Exploration Co. and Zavanna Energy — said they follow the language in the leases. In fact, most leases, like the Skarphols’, don’t explicitly mention deductions. The companies also said that while there are additional expenses to selling the oil and gas farther away from the well site, doing so also leads to a better price for both the companies and the owners. 
The companies, as well as the organization that advocates for the industry, blamed some of the fees charged to private owners on costly state regulations enacted a decade ago. 
“Basically it got really, really expensive and really, really challenging. And I think it put the economics of gas in a whole different position,” said Ness of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which represents more than 550 oil and gas companies in the state. “Pure and simple, the world changed.”
‘Saddled with expenses’
Diana Skarphol was less than a year old when her mother’s family, the Iversons, first leased the rights to any oil found under their land to Amerada Petroleum, which later merged with Hess, in 1949. The Iverson family had immigrated from Norway at the turn of the century. They’d farmed the land for decades, survived the dust bowl of the hard ’30s and were still feeling the effects of the Great Depression. 
The discovery of oil in 1951, setting off the state’s first oil boom, changed everything. Oil executives and workers flooded the small community. Diana Skarphol said her relatives welcomed them and invited them over for coffee.

It was a change in fortune for the Iversons and many other families. “They weren’t very rich farmers. They were just getting by. And this supplemented their income,” she said. The leases promised a 12.5% royalty on the oil’s market value the day it left the well site, “free of cost.” That means that the mineral owner is not responsible for costs to drill or operate a well or other production expenses. 
That’s why families like the Skarphols say they were perplexed when the deductions began.
The Skarphols keep decades of monthly royalty checks, so they can track when Hess began deducting money. A column titled “other deductions” first appeared in 1998 but remained blank until April 2007, when the company began to deduct less than 2% of their royalty, an amount they said was too small to notice at the time. 
North Dakota’s oil and gas industry was on the verge of momentous change. The shale oil boom, triggered by new technologies, had arrived. Crude oil was fetching $100 a barrel by 2008, and the “drill, baby, drill” spirit took hold before the phrase was ever uttered in the White House. 
But the oil was leaving the surface intermingled with vast quantities of wet natural gas, which the companies often disposed of by burning it. The sight of small flames, called flares, became ubiquitous in the Bakken. 
Flaring looked unsightly, polluted the air and wasted a natural resource that could be sold. State officials enacted regulations in 2014 that required companies to curtail the flaring. The industry, in turn, said it has spent an estimated $25 billion so far to build the necessary infrastructure to collect the gas, process it and export it through pipelines.

Companies pass on to owners a share of those infrastructure costs, as well as the expenses associated with processing and transporting oil and gas, sometimes to far-flung markets. Whether owners ought to share in these costs is the heart of the debate.
The industry justifies the shared costs by citing a North Dakota Supreme Court ruling that empowered companies to deduct expenses. That 2009 ruling, which addressed a narrow issue related to natural gas, concluded that the value of the gas for royalty purposes should be calculated “at the well,” where it leaves the ground. 
That laid the groundwork for postproduction deductions. The ruling meant that when calculating royalties, companies could start with the sale price and then deduct the costs incurred after the minerals were extracted — what has been called the postproduction phase — to determine how the resources would have been valued at the well. But to royalty owners whose leases promise a royalty “free of cost,” the fact that companies incur expenses before selling the oil and gas is not their problem. 
“Mineral owners are being saddled with expenses,” said Neil Christensen, the agent for his three sisters who inherited mineral rights in McKenzie County that they lease to Hess. Those expenses, he suggested, should “reduce stockholder dividends, not reduce mineral owner income.”

Private royalties in North Dakota, estimated in the billions

There’s a lot of money at stake. North Dakota Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican who routinely sponsors bills advocating for the interests of both the industry and royalty owners, estimates that companies deduct “at least hundreds of millions of dollars” every year. He says companies should use their revenues to cover the postproduction costs — as they did before the most recent oil boom. 
An executive with XTO Energy told lawmakers in 2021 that the oil and gas company deducts on average $30 million annually, or about 21% of the royalties owed to private leaseholders in North Dakota. Mary Ellen Denomy, a forensic accountant who has audited royalty statements across the country and for at least 30 North Dakotans in the last decade, said that about 22% of royalties are deducted on average — which would have amounted to $1 billion in 2023. These figures are in line with royalty statements that mineral owners shared with the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica.
It’s difficult to verify what specific costs each company deducts because companies don’t detail those, either for royalty owners or for the state, instead providing only broad categories on the statements that accompany their checks.
Hess said it is a “common industry practice” to pass on some infrastructure costs, such as the $1.5 billion the company spent on pipelines, the expansion of a gas processing plant and construction of other facilities in the early 2010s. Hillary Durgin Harmon, a Hess spokesperson, said those investments support economic growth by increasing oil and gas production and transporting it to more markets, benefiting royalty owners and the state overall.
Zavanna Energy also attributed the increased deductions to infrastructure expenses, including the cost of getting landowners’ permission to install pipelines in the state, according to the company’s general counsel. 
“I’ve seen the costs associated with obtaining pipeline easements in some parts of North Dakota increase as much as 3000% over the last 10 years,” Zavanna’s Gillian Wilkin said. “Those increased costs can substantially influence the price that must be paid to get oil and gas to downstream markets.”
Todd Slawson, chairman of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, defended owners sharing the costs to move and enhance oil and gas after leaving the well site. Such “post-marketability” costs, he said, benefit the owners, too.
“The objective of the operator is also to obtain the best prices for all parties,” said Slawson, who owns Slawson Exploration Co., another energy company. “We are all in this together, so everyone wants the best price.”
He called royalty owners like the Skarphols, who inherited leases, “very lucky and fortunate.” “What a great country we live in where minerals can be privately owned — I do not know of another country where that occurs, but there probably are some,” he said. In most countries, oil and gas are largely owned by the government.
Bob and Diana Skarphol didn’t feel fortunate when Hess began taking unexpected deductions in 2015. Nor did Brian Anderson, who also inherited a lease with Hess that his father signed in 1949. Donald Anderson was then a 21-year-old farmer who worked in a coal mine on his property to support his younger siblings. 
The family started getting royalties soon after. But since the company began taking deductions a decade ago, Brian Anderson said his family has lost more than $600,000.
“The fact that they just arbitrarily started taking it just sticks in my craw so bad,” said Anderson, who at one time worked for Hess. “You don’t take anything for 60 years, and then all of a sudden you, abracadabra, can do it?”

By the fall of 2018, Skarphol had talked to enough other mineral owners to realize that deductions had begun appearing on many of their royalty statements — and they weren’t stopping.
Skarphol called a meeting at City Hall in Williston on a brisk October evening to discuss what they could do about it. Dozens of mineral owners filled every seat and stood shoulder to shoulder in the back of the room. 
Janice Arnson, who along with her seven siblings inherited mineral rights from their mother, stood up and declared that deductions were “out of control.” One particular lease, signed by her mother in 2009, began paying royalties a few years later when Hess drilled a well. The deductions were minuscule at first and then skyrocketed to 23% of Arnson’s royalty check in February 2015. “We just want to be paid our fair share,” she said at the meeting.
“I want the Legislature to take this seriously,” said Linda Meyer, a mineral owner in Williams County.
Skarphol, who called the meeting, responded. “Do we want to get angry enough to do something about it?” Skarphol asked the crowd. “I do.”
That night, the mineral owners formed the Williston Basin Royalty Owners Association.

‘Such a hopeless feeling’
The group started with a request at the beginning of the 2019 legislative session for the state to study the issue and consider potential solutions. Lawmakers approved the request, but the committee that selects which studies should be completed discarded the proposal.
In 2021, royalty owners worked with legislators to draft a bill to directly address their concerns. Among other changes, the legislation would have prohibited deductions unless they were explicitly allowed for in a lease and would have permitted royalty owners to audit a company’s records, at the royalty owners’ expense, to ensure they are being paid correctly. 
Curtis Trulson, a retired farmer, shared concerns about the deductions with lawmakers during that session. He receives royalty payments through leases with multiple companies, and he first started noticing his royalty payments were diminishing during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“Nobody ever called and said, ‘Well, we’re going to start taking these costs and here’s why.’ It just started disappearing,” Trulson said. “Almost every operator is doing the same thing now. They didn’t all do it to start with.”

Trulson emailed details of his situation, and a royalty statement, to seven senators on the committee considering the bill drafted by the royalty owners. Some deductions “go totally unexplained!” he told them. The only legislator who responded was the one Democrat, Merrill Piepkorn. 
“I hate to say this because I lean a little more on the Republican side and I’m more conservative,” Trulson said. “Other ones didn’t even bother to respond or say thanks for the information or anything.” He added: “The state of North Dakota doesn’t want to help us out.”
The legislation was turned into a study, which ultimately recommended no changes to state law.
“I had a hard time keeping from screaming,” Anderson said of his frustration during the hearings, which he attended in person. 
The mineral owners tried for more modest changes in 2023. That year, they pushed for a bill that would have required companies to provide royalty statements in spreadsheets. While state law requires that companies provide them that way for publicly owned minerals, there is no such requirement for private owners. 
That legislation failed, too.
“Every time we make any kind of an attempt it seems like the industry has a whole lot more influence over the Legislature in North Dakota than the people do,” Christensen said.
Arnson, who worked with Skarphol to bring concerns about this issue to legislators’ attention, said she feels betrayed by her representatives. 
“It was such a hopeless feeling,” Arnson said. “Have I lost a lot of faith? Yes I have.”

Legislators from both parties who were involved in the efforts to amend state law told the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica that repeated legislative measures have failed because of the industry’s impact on the state economy and subsequent influence in state politics. State and local governments took in about $32 billion in oil and gas taxes between 2008 and 2024, according to a study by the Western Dakota Energy Association. That same study found that more than 50% of all local tax collections are tied to oil and gas.
The industry’s influence “has curtailed any investigation or legislation regarding looking into the validity of the deductions,” Piepkorn said. “Ron Ness is a pretty smooth talker,” he said of the industry’s chief lobbyist. “We just take what he says for gospel.” Ness said his reputation with policymakers as “a trusted and respected voice for the industry” has been “hard earned” over 27 years. 
Bekkedahl, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee that crafts the state budget, said more than half the state’s revenues are tied to oil and gas activity. He called the energy industry’s lobbying efforts on this issue “very aggressive” but said lawmakers need to address concerns about royalty deductions.
“I’ve always maintained that we should, as the Legislature, provide some clarity to this issue so that the courts can make the interpretations with clear statutes in place, which they don’t have now,” Bekkedahl said.

North Dakota Petroleum Council staff have testified to lawmakers that the state should not get involved in what it describes as private contract disputes. 
But the Legislature has gotten involved in other contract issues championed by the energy industry, including this year when it approved legislation related to coal leases. The new state law allows the companies to extract critical minerals from coal without having to negotiate amendments to existing leases. 
Joseph Schremmer, a University of Oklahoma law professor who specializes in the energy industry, said the Legislature can take action on other issues affecting private contracts as long as there is a “legitimate state interest.” 
“The Legislature has the power to do many things that would potentially modify the operation of existing contracts,” he said. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican who is both a royalty owner and a former executive in his family’s oil company, declined to comment for this story. He said in an interview last year that royalty owners should rely on the courts, though litigation is expensive and not feasible for most.
“If you think you have a litigation issue, litigate it,” Armstrong said. “You’re trying to use the state of North Dakota as your private lawyer. If you are in a contract dispute, there is a better place to settle that.”

Diana Skarphol is doing just that. She is one of 34 plaintiffs from the extended Iverson family who sued Hess in 2021 for $10 billion in damages, arguing that the company breached their contracts by taking deductions. 
Northwest Judicial District Judge Robin Schmidt ruled in favor of Hess and dismissed the case last week. North Dakota law, which the Skarphols and other families have been asking the Legislature to change for years, “is not on your side,” she told the plaintiffs in a June hearing.
But where this will end is unclear: The North Dakota Supreme Court has overturned this judge’s rulings on a different case related to deductions. And the Skarphols’ attorney said they will likely appeal. Schmidt also told the plaintiffs they could bring a new lawsuit over a different set of oil wells.
Meanwhile, Bob and Diana Skarphol continue to open the checks each month and calculate their losses. So far this year, Hess has deducted 36%.

Construction is also underway across the street, where a new legislative office is being built to house lawmaker offices and committee rooms. Both projects are a part of a $392 million renovation plan the Georgia General Assembly approved last year.
The Gold Dome has been a symbol of the state since its construction in 1889. Renovation plans are designed to preserve this history while simultaneously celebrating a new chapter.
“It’s a place of history as well as a place of government, and so the building itself should reflect that,” said Timothy Crimmins, co-author of “Democracy Restored: A History of the Georgia State Capitol.”
When the state Capitol was initially constructed, there was a strict $1 million dollar budget and a requirement that Georgia materials should be utilized when possible. Financial restraints made it difficult to locally source some construction materials. This led to Indiana limestone being used for the exterior of the Capitol and European carpets being imported for interior chambers.
The current renovation of the Capitol is being done in the same spirit. Backed by a $83 million restoration budget for the historic Capitol building alone, the project has already incorporated local materials from floor to ceiling.
Shaw Floors, a Dalton-based company, made the new carpet being installed in both the House and Senate chambers. Long dubbed the “Carpet Capital of the World,” Dalton is known for producing between 85 to 90% of U.S. carpet, according to state Rep. Kasey Carpenter, a Republican who represents Dalton.
“It’s a sense of pride obviously for northwest Georgia to make sure that we have a place in the Capitol,” Carpenter said.

Dalton isn’t the only city that has found a place to shine at the Capitol. Dahlonega gold was used last year when Georgia’s iconic dome was regilded during initial renovation stages.
While a lot of change has happened at the Capitol since 1889, Gerald Pilgrim, the Georgia Building Authority chief of staff who is overseeing renovations, said he hopes that by the end of the project, the Capitol will look and feel a lot like its early days.
To bring this vision back to life, Pilgrim and his team have emphasized historical accuracy by hiring historical preservation architects and a preservationist subtractor. Together, even small details like lighting and color schemes have been fact checked. Numerous light studies were conducted after restoring chandeliers from the 1900s to ensure that each bulb emits an appropriate glow.
Lawmakers’ desks are currently being refinished and will all receive a new USB port before returning to the Capitol. Chairs have been replaced with replicas, but old chairs will be kept in storage and be made available by seat-holder’s request.
Skybridge debate lingers
Construction at the new legislative office building has progressed and is on track to be finished by the end of next year.
“At the (Coverdell building) the offices were very small and cramped,” Pilgrim said. “Everybody’s (new) office is going to be the same size. They’re all going to be 226 square feet, which is about double what they currently have, and all (offices) have a window view of either the Capitol or downtown Atlanta, there’s not an obstructed view in the building.”

The eight-story building will also feature a skybridge meant to create an accessible way to move between the new offices on Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. SW and the Capitol building.
Constructing a bridge or tunnel has been a decades-long conversation at the statehouse. Crimmins said an earlier proposal to add a bridge from the Capitol to the current legislative office across Mitchell Street was ultimately rejected. Officials instead reduced traffic with street closures.
When conversations about a skybridge reemerged, the idea was met with concerns from preservationists. Pilgrim said the Georgia Building Authority considered alternatives before deciding that the skybridge was the best option.
“We looked at doing a tunnel with the cost being about four times more expensive,” Pilgrim said. “But more importantly, the tunnel was not going to improve accessibility.”
To address preservationists’ concerns, Pilgrim said the skybridge will bear its own weight and won’t require any demolition. This allows the bridge to be easily removed in future years if the project does not prove to be as successful as anticipated. Construction will use similar materials that match the Capitol’s existing aesthetic and include arches that mimic the building’s renaissance style architecture.
David Mitchell, executive director of the Atlanta Preservation Center, has been a vocal opponent of the skybridge. Comparing it to a “bizarre umbilical cord,” he argues that claims of improved accessibility are ironic considering the limited public awareness and outreach about renovations.
“You’re telling me you’re spending $10 million for something to be used for four months, if even,” Mitchell said, referring to the skybridge. “It’s not like it’s being used 12 months out of the year, and is helping multiple handicapped accessible people. We’re not talking about something like an ADA compliance, we’re talking about during the session when the greatest usage of this will take place.”
Despite continued debate over the skybridge, construction was approved in June when the Atlanta City Council signed over the air rights that will allow the bridge to be built next year.
Original library will be restored

If entering the Capitol from the skybridge, pedestrians will be welcomed through a soon-to-be-restored state library that was part of the original Capitol. The two-story library will bring a variety of books back to the statehouse and offer additional meeting spaces for public affairs.
The library was converted into office space around 1910 and was completely eliminated by 1950, according to Pilgrim. After the restoration, the current offices and copy room occupying the space will relocate to the first floor. An observation space is planned to give visitors a chance to watch the restoration process.
“We’ll have Plexiglas partitions in there so when school groups come in and tour, they’re going to see the artisans in there doing the work,” Pilgrim said.
Renovations and new construction are all on track to be completed by the end of 2027. The three-year project is not expected to interfere with next year’s legislative session.

Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and Tanya Storer of Whitman, who will shepherd the bills through the Legislature. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’ efforts to crack down on delta-8, marijuana and other THC products crossed state lines Friday with a new lawsuit against a nationwide manufacturer and distributor.
Hilgers and his office filed a lawsuit in Lancaster County District Court against Savage Enterprises, a Wyoming corporation based in California. The lawsuit accuses Savage of falling “woefully short” on Nebraska labeling and safety laws and argues that it aims to “entice and ultimately ensnare” children and teenagers.
A Nebraska consumer alerted the Attorney General’s Office to Savage Enterprises, leading to the investigation, according to the lawsuit. 
The investigation included the testing of at least seven vape, gummy or edible products that purported to include certain types or levels of THC that were ultimately inaccurate. The lawsuit alleges the corporation also “recklessly ignored” health warning signs against delta-8 and other tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products and did not appropriately warn consumers.
“Nebraska consumers cannot predict with any degree of certainty which ingredients Savage Enterprises puts into its products, nor understand the potential intoxicating or other adverse effects that may result from their consumption,” the lawsuit states.
Savage Enterprises did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

The lawsuit included a section that specified how many products Savage Enterprises has provided to how many retail smoke and vape shops throughout Nebraska, including in Lancaster County, but the specific numbers were redacted from the filing, including in the official court documents. An attorney general’s spokesperson did not answer a reporter’s question on why the numbers were redacted.
Among the allegations in the lawsuit is that Savage Enterprises offers online purchases without age verification and has used advertising that Hilgers’ office says is geared toward minors.
Hilgers’ office says the advertising included a Black Friday promotion in November 2023 promoting a free Nintendo Switch or Sony Playstation 5, social media content creators promoting Savage Enterprises products on various platforms, a Discord server where employees promote products and offer prizes, funny memes posted to appear “trendy and cool” and packaging with fruity flavors, cartoons, bright colors and childish fonts.
The lawsuit also accuses Savage Enterprises of using sex appeal through “young, attractive models” who it argues posted “sexually provocative” or “scantily clad” images or videos while using THC-containing products from Savage Enterprises.
“Savage Enterprises recklessly disregarded the fact that its strategies would appeal to adolescents and teens and would induce them to try Savage Enterprises’ THC products,” the lawsuit states.
This is the 16th Hilgers-led lawsuit alleging violations of Nebraska’s Consumer Protection Act and Nebraska Pure Food Act since he took office in 2023. His office has sent 225 cease and desist letters, too, including 21 in the last month.
Those letters have been sent to shops from Ralston to Scottsbluff, including 104 smoke and vape shops in Omaha, 82 in Lincoln, four in Kearney and three in Nebraska City.
Hilgers has tried to partner with state lawmakers in legislative attempts to take such products off Nebraska shelves that he maintains are already illegal under state and federal law. Past legislative attempts have stalled but will likely be revived in 2026.
The latest, in a partnership with State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, would classify most “hemp” products as marijuana and severely limit, if not ban, most hemp and THC-containing products in Nebraska.
Hilgers is asking Lancaster County District Court to stop Savage Enterprises and anyone “in active concert or participation” with the corporation from continuing the allegedly illegal behavior. The lawsuit seeks $2,000 for each violation of state law.
“The Attorney General will not sit idly by while Savage Enterprises enriches itself and its owners by endangering the health and well-being of Nebraska’s most valuable asset: its children and teenagers,” the lawsuit states.

U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

Helping them in their efforts is Todd Graves, a prominent Kansas City attorney and chairman of the Herzog Foundation, which participates in the voucher program through an affiliated nonprofit connecting Missouri students and private schools with scholarship funding.
Graves is also a member of the University of Missouri Board of Curators. He filed the motion to intervene in the case in Cole County circuit court last week. 
The lawsuit targets a state tax credit program called MOScholars that relies on nonprofits like the Herzog Foundation — called “educational assistance organizations” — to gather donations and distribute scholarships to students in private, parochial or home schools. Donors can receive a tax credit equal to 100% of their contribution but can use it to cover no more than half of their state tax liability. 
However, the budget signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe includes an injection of general revenue to the MOScholars program, budgeting $50 million in taxpayer funds for scholarships and $1 million to assist marketing the program.
The three parents seeking to intervene in the lawsuit — one from Kearney, one from Kirkwood and one from Springfield — say they’ve used MoScholars and expect their families to benefit from the influx of state money. 
They are represented by EdChoice Legal Advocates, an Indiana-based nonprofit that advocates for school-choice measures. Graves filed the motion to intervene because he’s a licensed attorney in Missouri. 
“Missouri families depend on MOScholars to afford educational options that best fit their children’s needs,” said Thomas Fisher, director of litigation at EdChoice Legal Advocates. “We are proud to support these brave parents who are stepping forward to defend and protect the expansion of the MOScholars program.”
Missouri educators sue state over $51 million appropriation to private school vouchers

The lawsuit, filed by the Missouri National Education Association and two public school teachers, argues a direct appropriation of taxpayer funds to MOScholars is unconstitutional. 
The 2021 law that created MOScholars only prescribes the use of tax-deductible donations to educational assistance organizations as its funding source — not general revenue. The lawsuit contends that a direct appropriation to the program effectively changes the MOScholars law,  and changing state statute in a budget bill is not allowed.
Plaintiffs had hoped a Cole County judge would expedite the case so that a temporary restraining order could be in place before state money is dispersed through the voucher program. 
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey argued his office needed more time to prepare for the case, citing recent departures of two top aides who would have been involved in the litigation. 
“A rushed response could lead to inadvertent admissions or incomplete answers, which would unfairly prejudice the defendants’ ability to present a full and fair defense,” the attorney general’s office said in its filing. 
The judge agreed with Bailey, and arguments over the teacher’s union request for a temporary restraining order are set for late August.
Critics of Missouri’s voucher program argue that shifting state resources into private schools could hurt public education around the state. That’s especially true, they contend, in rural Missouri, where there are few options for private or religious schools. 
“Politicians in Jefferson City and their privatization lobbyists are stealing from our kids,” Missouri NEA President Phil Murray told The Independent last month. “In rural Missouri, that $51 million means losing our music teacher, canceling basketball and watching our schools crumble. They’re killing our small towns.”
Proponents argue the program is a vital resource for families who do not feel public schools are the best option for their children.  
Libby Eversgerd, a single mother of four from Kirkwood and one of the parents seeking to intervene in the lawsuit, said her daughter struggled in public schools before eventually dropping out. When her son started having similar issues years later, she was able to use MOScholars to help enroll in a private school where she says his grades and attendance improved dramatically.
“The recent expansion of the program is constitutional,” EdChoice’s Fischer said, “and will expand education freedom for low-income families and students with learning differences.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/herzogfoundation2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Immigration drives nation’s population growth

Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Patience was thin and the Rhode Island Senate calendar heavy on the afternoon of June 12 as lawmakers sprinted toward the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Time was running out to change the fate of a proposed assault weapons ban, the biggest policy question hanging over the Rhode Island State House.
So Sen. Pam Lauria made it quick. Reading prepared remarks from her phone, she asked to move the bill to a different committee, prompting an outcry from Senate Republicans. Senate President Valarie Lawson quickly interjected, commanding the lawmakers to let Lauria continue. 
Undeterred, Lauria finished and looked up and let her request sink in. The chamber fell into a secondslong, stunned silence. Then, protests and procedural questions poured in.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary assigned to vet the controversial gun safety policy appeared unlikely to advance the legislation. Rerouting the bill to the Senate Committee on Finance would have guaranteed a floor vote, where it was likely to pass.
Lawson ruled Lauria’s procedural request “out of order.” The Senate narrowly upheld Lawson’s conclusion by a 20-17 vote.
For Lauria, it was about gun safety. But it was also a bold move that forced her colleagues to confront the implicit expectations of loyalty above lawmaking. In just 30 seconds, she had recast the conversation and her own reputation — from quiet workhorse to change agent.
“It’s never been about relationships for me, as much as about the policy,” the Barrington Democrat said in a recent interview. “At the end of the day, I am the one that has to live with myself.” 










It's never been about relationships for me, as much as about the policy. At the end of the day, I am the one that has to live with myself.


– Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat


Changing which committee first vets and advances legislation to the full chamber is nothing new on Smith Hill. In 2019, the Senate rerouted the Reproductive Privacy Act, which codified federal abortion protections in state law, from its Judiciary Committee to the Committee on Health and Human Services, which subsequently forwarded it to the full chamber for passage. In 2022, after a proposed ban on high-capacity firearm magazines stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee under a tied vote, Senate leaders advanced the House version of the legislation directly to the floor, where it was approved. 
“Procedures are important, the process is important, but also, the reality is, we make that up,” said Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, who voted against Lawson’s out of order ruling. “If 19 people in that room agree on something, that makes it real.”
Lawson said she ruled Lauria out of order because the Judiciary Committee had already heard hours of impassioned testimony on the bill. 
“Senator Lauria’s motion violated Senate Rules and the legislative process which is at the heart of our work in the Senate,” Lawson said in an email.
The Senate’s adopted rules, however, suggest Lauria’s request was allowed. The chamber’s procedural guidebook lets senators object to the committee assignment of any House bill received during the previous legislative day. 
“Upon objection being made, the presiding officer shall assign the transmittal to the committee requested by the senator making the objection,” the rules state.
Five days later, the Judiciary Committee ultimately advanced an amended bill banning the sale — but not the possession — of assault-style weapons. Proponents defended the watered-down version, noting the legislation still prohibited the transfer of firearms, thus reducing the number of assault weapons in circulation in Rhode Island.
Lauria reluctantly voted for the scaled-back version of the legislation on the final night of the legislative session, signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee on June 26.
Lawson and Lauria became friends after Lauria won state office in 2022. The two East Bay lawmakers texted often, Lauria said. They shared meals in their free time and hotel rooms at legislative conferences. Lauria canvassed for Lawson ahead of the 2024 Democratic primary. Lawson ascended to the president position after the death of  former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio in April. She donated $300 to Lauria’s campaign on June 8, according to the most recent campaign finance statements filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections. 
Four days later, Lauria asked to move the assault weapons ban to a different committee. The two have not spoken since.

A lawmaker who wears a white coat by day
Lauria’s commitment to safer gun laws is rooted in her experience as a trauma nurse at Rhode Island Hospital. Now a nurse practitioner for Brown University Health’s primary care office in East Greenwich, she loved the frenzy, the technicalities of wound care, the chance to help. But the memories of treating patients with gunshot wounds linger decades later.
As a freshman senator, Lauria sponsored legislation mandating safe storage of firearms, shepherding the contested proposal through two years of late-night committee hearings and behind-the-scenes negotiations until it became law in 2024. 
“Statistically-speaking, the safe storage bill will save more lives than the assault weapons bill will,” Lauria said. “But that’s what terrifies people, assault weapons. It’s truly terrorism, and also enormously lethal. We don’t allow cars on the road that can go 150 miles an hour.”
Lauria, who grew up in East Providence, earned both her bachelor’s degree and a master’s of science to be a nurse practitioner at the University of Rhode Island. 
Her political career almost ended after a single campaign season. She lost a bid for a seat on the Barrington School Committee in 2016 after vigorously campaigning against a proposal to start the school day earlier. Her position was informed by her professional and personal experience as a mom trying to get her then-teenagers to get out of bed earlier in the morning.
She lost by 50 votes, finishing fourth in a four-way race for the three open seats on the nonpartisan school board. 
Lauria turned down an offer to chair the town Democratic Committee three times before she said yes.
“Why would it be me?” she said of her reluctance. “I hadn’t been on the committee before. I had no idea what the job would entail. And, I think like a lot of women, you need a few times before you say ‘yes.’”
After five years of helping recruit and train candidates for local office and galvanizing voters as head of the Barrington Democratic Town Committee, Lauria still never saw herself on Smith Hill. When Rhode Island Sen. Cindy Coyne opted not to seek a third term in 2022 and asked Lauria to run in her place for the seat representing parts of Barrington and East Providence, she declined.
Lauria’s husband, David, a music teacher at Mount Hope High School, urged her to reconsider.
“You have to do this,” David recalled telling his wife. “This is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.”
Lauria agreed to try. She succeeded, trouncing a primary opponent and a general election competitor.










Procedures are important, the process is important, but also, the reality is, we make that up. If 19 people in that room agree on something, that makes it real.


– Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat


Months into her first term, in April 2023, longtime senator and former majority whip Maryellen Goodwin died of cancer. Goodwin’s death began a period of grief and instability that would plague the upper chamber for the next three years as Ruggerio’s health also worsened. Ruggerio died on April 21.
The part-time position as state lawmaker consumed Lauria’s evenings and weekends throughout the six-month session. Lauria used three hours of vacation each week, working without a lunch break, to accommodate the Senate’s biweekly afternoon sessions with her day job.
Many of the bills Laura has sponsored or advocated for directly reflect her experiences in the exam room, like a 2023 bill signed into law requiring insurance providers to cover the cost of EpiPen refills.
“I don’t know how she did it, to be honest,” said Dr. Kristen Hubbard, lead physician and Lauria’s longtime colleague at Brown University Health. “You would see her run from here to there each week, and she was always 100% focused when she was at our office, and 100% focused when she was there. She’s tough.”

A growing distance
Lauria voted “present” at the November 2024 caucus to elect new Senate leaders. Lawson, recently tapped by Ruggerio to be his second in command, voted for Ruggerio to serve another term as president.
That was when Lauria felt something shift in their friendship.
Six months later, after Ruggerio’s death, Lauria voted for Sen. Ryan Pearson, not Lawson, for president. When senators were asked to vote on the chamber floor later that day, Lauria voted for Lawson because she knew Pearson could not win. 
They continued to meet to talk through legislative solutions to critical health care issues like primary care reimbursements and the abrupt closure of Anchor Medical Associates. 
“I don’t think punishment is Val’s MO,” Lauria said.”I’ve always been given the opportunity to be heard, and I hope that continues.”
She maintains faith in Lawson as a leader.
“I think that she could, she will, be a good president,” Lauria said. “It’s really always just been about what I thought was best for the chamber.” 
Lawson declined to comment on her personal relationship with Lauria, but stressed her respect for Lauria’s advice and expertise, especially on health care.
DiMario, a friend and confidante to Lauria throughout the chaotic 2025 session, said Rhode Island politics could use more perspectives like Lauria’s. DiMario was unsurprised by Lauria’s stand on the assault weapons ban.
“I think we share an ability to deal with uncomfortable things head-on,” DiMario said. “Honestly, I think our chamber and the General Assembly overall would benefit from more people approaching the work like she does.”
You wouldn’t know it from watching the Capitol TV recording of Lauria calmly delivering her June 12 speech, but she admits her heart was racing and her mouth was dry.
Looking back more than one month later, Lauria said she doesn’t regret her procedural request and would have made it regardless of who was Senate president. But, she acknowledged she might have opted to give Lawson a heads up beforehand.
“I wasn’t trying to make it difficult for her,” Lauria said. “I was actually trying to make it easy for her. In hindsight, would I go back and tell her about it? Maybe. I don’t know what would have happened. I can’t say what would have happened.”

(Photo provided)When children are unnecessarily removed from their homes, experts say the separation puts them at risk of chronic mental and physical ailments. 
With that in mind, four Kentucky libraries are launching programs to keep families together, well resourced and educated, aided with $200,000 in grant money from the national nonprofit Youth Villages. 
Libraries in Jackson, Johnson, Marshall and Spencer counties received around $45,000 each for a variety of programs to help parents meet their children’s needs. 
Britany Binkowski, the executive director of the Youth Village initiative New Allies, said libraries are a “low stigma, high access point of contact for all communities” and make sense for grassroots outreach. 
“They pretty consistently exist in most counties where they can be reached by lots of families, especially those in rural areas, and they’re (places) people trust to get information, to get access to resources,” she said. “They don’t carry the stigma, for example, of going to a child welfare department and asking for resources in a way that might feel very vulnerable.”  
Among other things, the libraries are using the grant month to host trainings on growing food in an apartment setting, teaching parents how to deal with challenging behaviors and how to cook basic recipes, and connecting families to other community resources where they can get car seats and other necessities. 
Libraries are also a more “natural” place to host visitations for parents who are working toward reunification, Binkowski said. 
It’s “often not the case” that a child is removed from a home because the parents are outright bad, she said. Most of the time, parents lack the resources to properly feed, clothe or otherwise care for their children, she said. In fact, about 70% of all Child Protective Services allegations are related to neglect and poverty, the Lantern previously reported. 
“We see substance use disorder and parents who are struggling with that as a significant driver of entries into foster care — not only in Kentucky, but across the country,” Binkowski said. 
Other preventable issues contribute to removal, she said, like a parent not being able to buy a car seat or access safe child care. 
“Things like that can cause safety issues that have to be resolved for a child to remain safe and stable,” Binkowski said. 
‘Before there’s a problem, let’s fix it.’ 
Tammy Blackwell, an author and the director of the Marshall County Public Library, said libraries working in this space is just “logical.”
“Libraries are already reaching families and just doing a lot of good work giving families a place to be and form bonds,” she said.

Marshall County’s grant supported a renovation of the Hardin branch to create a more child-friendly space and funded an eight-week program for mothers of young children called Mom’s Night Out. 
During the Mom’s Night Out program, which will start the first week in September, mothers who are referred by Court Appointed Special Advocates will gather weekly and have a meal together. During the meal, representatives from the Marshall County Extension Office and the health department will lead discussions about stress management, home upkeep and how to cook recipes with staples handed out at food distribution centers like rice and beans. 
Because this is grant-funded, it’s not affected by recent changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, Blackwell said. Congress recently passed the Big Beautiful Bill Act, which cut funding for the SNAP Education program, among other things. 
The Mom’s Night Out discussions will be in a “very non-judgmental way, and not in a lecturing kind of way, but as a conversation and getting those families very comfortable in that space, very comfortable with library staff, comfortable with community partners who they may need to call on at some point,” Blackwell explained. 
“We’re hoping that they build a bond with each other; other people with similar lived experiences, and to really give them a sense of community and resources in order to help the mothers thrive, so that the children may thrive,” she added. “I love that it’s ‘before there’s a problem, let’s fix it.’” 
The first round of the program will only include mothers — Blackwell hopes between 12 to 15 — who have children of preschool to early elementary school age. Should it be successful and receive funding for a repeat, she’d like to expand it to fathers as well. 
“There’s been some coverage of how many kids in Kentucky are in either foster or kinship care situations,” Blackwell said. “It’s a lot of kids, and that really impacts their ability to be successful in life. And anything that we can do to strengthen those families and give those kids, then we need to at least try. And I think libraries are in a perfect position to really make a difference.” 
The 2024 Kids Count report, from Kentucky Youth Advocates and the Annie E. Casey Foundation, showed there were nearly 46,000 youth in foster care in the state from 2021-2023. In that same time period, the number of children leaving foster care and reunited with their families dropped to 32%. Pre-pandemic, from 2016-2018, it was 36%. 
Additionally, in 2024 there were around 55,000 Kentucky children being raised with a relative in a kinship care arrangement. 
The Department for Community Based Services came up with the idea to partner with libraries, Binkowski said. Lesa Dennis, the DCBS commissioner, wasn’t available for an interview but said in a statement that “by meeting families where they are, we’re building pathways to stability, resilience and well-being so no family has to face challenges alone.” 
Removal is ‘traumatizing’

Binkowski, who previously worked as Assistant General Counsel for the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services, said that “a foster care intervention, even if necessary, is traumatizing to everyone involved.” It can damage bonds between parents and their children and upend daily routine and connections, she said. 
“We have a substantial body of evidence that tells us that children do best when they are with their families of origin — when it can be safe,” she said. “We know that connections to biological family, knowing where you came from, feeling like you belong — those are really critical emotional stabilization and safety factors that support children’s growth and development.” 
Experiencing brokenness in the home, abuse or neglect are Adverse Childhood Experiences, which refers to traumas or stressors in a person’s life before their 18th birthday. They include, but are not limited to, parental divorce, abuse, parental incarceration, substance use issues in the home and more. The more such experiences a person has, the more likely they are to have poor health, lower education and economic hardships. Childhood trauma also cost Kentucky around $300 million a year. 
“Enough stressors on a child at early ages without protective capacities to keep them from having negative outcomes can literally take years off of their lives,” Binkowski said. “So, while we don’t want children to experience abuse and neglect … we also don’t want them unnecessarily being removed from their home if the issues are not creating those kinds of negative impacts and we can stabilize a family without requiring removal.”

The bill was signed into law as Act 52 of 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers overwhelmingly approved three laws during the 2025 legislative session meant to increase patients’ access to prescription medication.
One of those laws has since been blocked in federal court, but the other two will go into effect Tuesday.
Act 52 removes the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. Supporters of the law, including some of the state’s largest hospital systems, said patients should benefit from hospital pharmacies’ capacity to afford more expensive drugs and remain open at all hours compared to local independent pharmacies.
Additionally, Act 630 prohibits drug manufacturers from restricting the availability of medication to a “limited distribution network of out-of-state pharmacies.”
  Rep. Brandon Achor, R-Maumelle (Arkansas Secretary of State)
Republican Rep. Brandon Achor of Maumelle, a practicing pharmacist and the lead sponsor of Act 630, said in an interview that manufacturers have the power to limit which pharmacies can purchase their drugs. He called this “a huge public safety issue,” especially when the availability of some drugs is limited to mail-order pharmacies.
“These patients should not be contingent on an airplane or a FedEx truck,” Achor told a House committee in March. “They should be contingent on being able to access [pharmacies] in real time.”
Achor was a co-sponsor and vocal supporter of Act 624 of 2025, which would have banned pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
A federal judge temporarily blocked Act 624 in July after four PBMs and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association filed lawsuits against it. Supporters of the law said it would prevent PBMs from financially straining local pharmacies to the point of forcing them to close, but U.S. District Judge Brian Miller ruled that the law “likely violates” the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause. The state filed a notice of appeal with the court on Thursday, and both plaintiffs and defendants asked Miller to stay further proceedings until the appeal is decided.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association supported Act 624. CEO John Vinson told a Senate committee in April that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by Act 624.
Committee rejects bill to allow nonprofit Arkansas hospitals to hold retail pharmacy permits

The initial version of Act 52 would have simply removed the portion of state code banning hospitals from having retail pharmacies. It failed in committee in January after Vinson and others expressed concerns that competition from hospitals’ in-house pharmacies could snuff out independent pharmacies. A 2023 bill similar to Act 52 did not advance in the Legislature.
Lawmakers amended the eventual Act 52 to replace the deleted code with specific provisions, such as allowing the State Board of Pharmacy to issue permits for retail pharmacies within 250 yards of a nonprofit hospital’s physical location in Arkansas, plus one additional pharmacy permit per 100 beds in the hospital.
Additionally, Act 52 does not place a limit on the number of retail pharmacies that nonprofit hospitals could operate in conjunction with infusion centers, and it allows these hospitals to direct their pharmacies’ services to underserved areas.
 Projected impacts on patients

The Arkansas Pharmacists Association was neutral on the final version of Act 52. Vinson said in an interview last week that the combined impact of Acts 52, 624 and 630 “will benefit a whole lot more people than just this one law alone.”
“It’s not just [about] how many pharmacies there are, but [whether] the patients have a fair market where they can access drugs at the lowest cost where they want to, rather than where a fox guarding the henhouse forces the patients to a pharmacy they don’t want to use through the mail at a higher price,” Vinson said.
Vinson and independent pharmacists have repeatedly denounced PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices and steer clients to their own affiliate pharmacies. They have also claimed PBMs routinely break or skirt around Arkansas’ existing laws meant to regulate them.
Act 900 of 2015 required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, and two 2018 laws prohibited PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors.










These patients should not be contingent on an airplane or a FedEx truck. They should be contingent on being able to access (pharmacies) in real time.


– Rep. Brandon Achor, R-Maumelle, lead sponsor of Act 630


Three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, all of whom sued Arkansas over Act 624 — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a July 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.
Vinson noted that even if Act 624’s lack of enforcement means nonprofit hospital pharmacies can’t provide patients with specific drugs, the existence of those pharmacies due to Act 52 still broadens patient access to other drugs.
Administrators from Baptist Health and Mercy Arkansas Hospitals both expressed support for Act 52 before lawmakers in January.
Baptist does not plan to submit an application for a retail pharmacy permit immediately but still “broadly supports the concept that hospitals should have that opportunity to fulfill the need” for more accessible medications, particularly for infusion drugs, said Jordan Burgess, Baptist’s vice president of government relations and public affairs.
Meanwhile, the Southwest Arkansas Regional Medical Center is in the process of becoming a nonprofit hospital, said Clay Hobbs, chief operating officer of Pafford Health Systems, the locally-owned medical service company that runs the hospital in Hope.
The hospital plans to take advantage of Act 52 upon becoming a nonprofit, and providing reliable access to prescription drugs in an area with few existing pharmacies will be a “great opportunity for our rural communities” in Southwest Arkansas, Hobbs said.

The State Board of Pharmacy is required to process pharmacy permit applications within a month of receiving them, and processing includes an on-site inspection of the facility, board executive director John Kirtley said in an email.
CARTI Cancer Center has 18 locations statewide, including 11 licensed pharmacies. Some of those locations are limited in what cancer drugs they can provide thanks to limited distribution networks, and Act 630 will alleviate that, CARTI CEO Adam Head told a House committee in March, speaking in favor of the legislation.
The only opponent of Act 630 before the Legislature was Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade organization representing drug manufacturers. PHRMA supported the intent of the legislation but wanted more time “to make sure there’s no harm with this new [drug] delivery system,” Sharon Lamberton, the organization’s deputy vice president of state policy and external outreach, told the same House committee.
However, Act 630 will make it easier for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to provide patients with specialized cancer drugs, including those from clinical trials in which UAMS participates, spokesperson Leslie Taylor said Friday.
“We’re able to get them during the clinical trials, but then once we’ve done our part to help with this, that’s over with, and we have trouble accessing the drugs directly,” Taylor said.

This is especially true of his crusade to make the workforce and higher education less diverse.
He’s had success using losing lawsuits, investigations that do nothing but burn Missouri taxpayer dollars and threatening letters that misstate the law. 
On the day that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled traditional affirmative action programs in higher education unconstitutional, Bailey sent threatening letters to Missouri universities and municipalities in which he overstated what the ruling did and implied that all efforts at fostering diversity and inclusion in Missouri must be halted.  
In April, Bailey excoriated the Business Roundtable for having “racist DEI initiatives.” He wrote he would fight “woke political trends and blatant racial discrimination.” In an impressive act of government “jawboning” that Bailey has claimed to oppose in other contexts, he threatened that such policies “risk exposing your organizations to substantial liability.”
Bailey is suing IBM, alleging the company did too much to recruit non-white and female hires. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts (the “DEI” much maligned by the far-right) help companies hire and retain qualified people who they wouldn’t easily find through traditional white male networks. Many studies and companies have explained that diversity is good for profits and innovation, and that you don’t get a diverse workforce without making an effort to recruit one.
Bailey’s court filings come shockingly close to outright stating his contrary premise: women and non-white people are inherently inferior so any increase in their representation is bad. 
IBM argued that Bailey hasn’t pleaded that any Missouri employee or job applicant was discriminated against. Indeed, this looks like Bailey preening for the national anti-diversity warriors rather than addressing a Missouri problem. 
Though you wouldn’t know it from listening to Bailey, diversity is still a permissible goal under Supreme Court precedent. And it is typical for companies to reward executives for advancing corporate goals. 
But the IBM lawsuit looks like another one where Bailey could win with a loser of a case. IBM has long been known for being a model for inclusive policies and a great place to work. IBM’s diversity council began in the ‘90s. It has touted hiring a disabled employee in 1914. But this year it ended most of its diversity efforts. We’ll see whether IBM continues to fight back against Bailey.
Whatever happens, say goodbye to IBM and similarly situated companies employing more people here. Bailey has made it clear that employers should expect legal harassment for exercising their rights to association and free speech in Missouri.
Bailey has also sued Starbucks. His brief argues that the Starbucks workforce has become “more female and less white” — and that this is unacceptable. 
Starbucks appears to be defending the values that the company professes. The company is also likely aware that if it were to abandon its reasonable efforts to have a workforce more representative of its customer base, it could lead to a boycott and a massive stock hit like Target experienced.
Shareholders have realized that reversing inclusive policies is bad for business. Shareholders voted down anti-diversity proposals overwhelmingly this proxy season.
The market has spoken. So Bailey’s latest ploy is to punish free speech in the market. 
Bailey filed lawsuits against two firms that give shareholders advice on how to vote. He claims that they have engaged in “deceptive practices” by recommending inclusive policies. This is one of his many attempts to weaponize the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act, which was meant to protect Missourians from actual fraud.
But frivolous lawsuits against out-of-state corporations are not the only way to light taxpayer dollars on fire.
Bailey can burn up twice the Missouri tax dollars by having Missouri wage legal warfare against itself. See for example, Bailey’s investigation of the Hazelwood School District over an off-campus fight between students of different races, the three year lawsuit against the Springfield School District over demands to search thousands of documents for a list of possibly DEI-related terms that the District estimated would cost $170,000, or his new investigation of the City of Columbia over whether it might be trying to advance diversity and equity.
How does a successful, powerful white man come to have such resentment towards women and people of color for the modest gains we have made that he treats it as Missouri’s biggest problem? How does someone once known as a “reasonable and smart attorney” become a “warrior in the culture wars”? What could compel him to regularly use dehumanizing language about diversity proponents who merely want more people to have opportunities?
Did he get radicalized online? Bailey has filed a surprising number of lawsuits based on tweeted statements or videos. 
His IBM lawsuit cites a video circulated online. He sued Media Matters in response to an Elon Musk tweet (that lawsuit was thrown out as I predicted, but Media Matters had to cut staff due to the costs of Bailey and Musk lawsuits, so that’s another extra-legal win for Bailey). Bailey sued Planned Parenthood over a Project Veritas video, without bothering to get the unedited tape.
Another possibility is that this is how Republicans feel they need to make a name and impress Trump and MAGA. Still, I just can’t muster the cynicism to make it make sense.
Sometimes I wonder what Bailey’s mom thinks. 
I learned that Dr. Jessica Bailey was the first female dean of the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s School of Health Related Professions and a revered and beloved leader there — and a champion of diversity efforts. 
A 2022 article about her retirement describes Dr. Bailey’s mentorship and recruitment of the school’s then chief diversity and inclusion officer. In an earlier article, Dr. Bailey extolls that colleague for being “committed to providing opportunities for students who might otherwise not imagine themselves in a health care profession,” and having “the vision to recognize opportunities to make our health care work force be more representative of our Mississippi population.” 
These are goals that her son claims are unconstitutional and racist.
During Dr. Bailey’s tenure as dean, she oversaw the development of a Diversity and Inclusion Champion Professional Development and Certificate Program. She supervised PhD theses concerning the need to diversify the health work force and bone marrow donors. She was lauded for her personal involvement in a program that recruited young Black men into medical professions.
I asked Bailey’s office whether the attorney general thinks his mother was engaged in illegal “woke political trends and blatant racial discrimination” in general, or specifically with the mentorship program for Black men.
His office responded:
“Attorney General Bailey has no knowledge of these programs administered in another state, years ago, when he was not in office. What he does know is this: DEI programs that condition opportunity on skin color violate the Missouri Constitution and the foundational American promise of equality under the law. Whether it’s in corporate boardrooms, public universities, or government contracting, he will continue to fight race-based discrimination in any form. He has led on this issue since taking office.”  
That’s a clearer “yes, my mother did illegal, racist things” than I was expecting. 
Bailey is not just disavowing the work of his highly accomplished mother, who has referenced the barriers she overcame as a woman in a male dominated field and who worked to help others up the ladder. He is twisting the law to claim all such efforts are illegal.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/011325_Bailey1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.











It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, professor of sports marketing at Clemson University



After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

(Photo courtesy of Butte County Office of Education)Victoria Gomez de la Torre doesn’t know when — or if — the migrant children she serves are going to get the education help they’ve come to rely on.
Gomez de la Torre oversees the migrant education program for 12 central Florida counties. The federally funded service helps the children of migrant agricultural workers, who move within and between states based on planting and harvesting seasons.
Her staff identifies agricultural workers who’ve migrated to the area and helps them enroll their children in school. It also helps connect them with tutoring and medical care.
Earlier this summer, the Trump administration froze more than $6 billion in education funding, including money for migrant education, after-school programs, English-language programs for non-native speakers and other grants. Congress had already approved the money, but the administration said it wanted to conduct a review of the programs.
The administration announced July 25 it would release the remaining $5.5 billion of the money, after unfreezing $1.3 billion earlier last month.
But for Gomez de la Torre’s program, the damage had already been done: Without the money, it had to shut down this summer.

“We didn’t have enough money left over to carry the program,” said Joram Rejouis, the director of program development for the public schools in Alachua County, which includes Gainesville and is the largest of the 12 counties. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage.”
The program came to a complete halt when Gomez de la Torre’s 11 staff members were offered other positions in the school district. Throughout July, about five dozen migrant children across the 12 counties were without summer services. The funds were supposed to go out before the start of the month.
“It’s going horrendously,” said Gomez de la Torre. “Migrant families depend on us, rely on our system and our help.”
The Alachua County program serves about 1,000 to 1,200 children of migrant workers throughout the year, many in rural farming communities. Each year, roughly 17,000 migrant children are served by programs across Florida.
“It is a very valuable program for a very vulnerable population,” Rejouis said. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.”
Migrant children are less likely to have regular primary care and are more likely to face health conditions such as anemia and high blood pressure. Many migrant families who harvest food in the fields don’t have enough food themselves.
The program also helps with communication and translation among parents, teachers and guidance counselors. “We were their go-to for whenever they needed something,” Gomez de la Torre said. “Now, they don’t have us.”

The freeze in funds added to the uncertainty and fear created by the Trump administration’s broader moves to target benefits for immigrants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently announced it had added Head Start to the list of public programs that would be closed to immigrants who are here illegally. After the funding announcement earlier this month, a senior official said the administration had established “guardrails” to ensure the funds are not used “in violation of Executive Orders.”
“It’s anybody’s guess when we’ll come back,” Gomez de la Torre said. “If we’ll come back. If people who chose to retire will return, if their retirement can be rescinded. … Nobody knows exactly how it’s going to play out.”
A similar story is unfolding in California.
The statewide Mini Corps program, run by the Butte County Office of Education, north of Sacramento, connects migrant children at schools and labor camps with bilingual tutors who help them during the school day. Many of the tutors are former migrant children themselves, said Yvette Medina, who oversees the program.
The funding freeze forced the office to lay off around 400 workers statewide, according to spokesperson Travis Souders. Despite Friday’s announcement, the organization is waiting for official word — in writing — before reversing layoffs.
“There’s going to be many students out there who are just going to have another disadvantage to the disadvantages that we already have,” Medina said.
In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, the program was forced to shut down altogether, according to Medina.
Medina grew up in migrant labor camps, following her parents to the fields at 4 a.m. as they picked cherries and grapes before she went to school. Her parents worked throughout the Central Valley, back in Mexico and up and down the West Coast, all the way to Oregon.
“It is devastating,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the migrant program, I know for a fact there’s no way I would have graduated high school.”

 
Migrant families already are gripped with fear as the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids and arrests, which President Donald Trump insists are focused on those with criminal histories.
“They are terrified,” Gomez de la Torre said. “We had families stop sending kids to school and others who fled the country.”
Ruby Luis, a consultant who helps school districts across Florida identify and enroll migrant students in school, also was a migrant child. Her parents worked in orange groves, at strawberry and Christmas tree farms and produce-packing houses.
Program tutors read books with her and gave her school supplies. The program took her on college tours and she enrolled via a scholarship for migrant children — a first-generation college student. She eventually graduated with a degree in biology.
“Just having even somebody to talk to you about going to college — because you don’t have anybody to talk to about [that],” she said. “Having that support was really impactful.
“To take that away, and then now they just have to navigate it themselves, it creates these barriers,” Luis said. “And it can ultimately leave these children not having access to education.”

Sears.As immigrant rights are threatened daily by federal policies under the Trump administration, one of the country’s most influential immigration advocacy groups is losing its leader of more than three decades.
Gustavo Torres, who has served as executive director for 31 of his 34 years with the organization, plans to retire in November.
Before the 64-year-old civil rights advocate steps away, he’s going to strategize with his team on how to provide affordable housing, workplace rights and other services for the immigrant community.
But “My next chapter is…going to dedicate my time to my family,” Torres, who is now the youngest living sibling among eight brothers and sisters, said during a Zoom interview Tuesday while with family in Colombia, South America. “I know CASA will be in good hands.”
While a national search is underway to replace Torres, he will be honored during the organization’s 40th anniversary celebration Sept. 18.
Torres started working with the organization with three people in a church basement in Montgomery County in 1991.
Today, he said CASA has 250 staff members with its headquarters in Prince George’s County’s Langley Park neighborhood, home to one of the D.C. area’s largest concentration of Latinos. The organization also has offices in Virginia, Pennsylvania and a welcome center in Georgia that opened in 2022.
The staff, Torres said, balloons with up to 500 temporary employees hired during election seasons “because we need to keep building power in particular elections where we are located.”
Torres and his team have also increased CASA’s membership base to almost 200,000 people in 46 states and Puerto Rico.
He made CASA the most influential immigrant rights and immigrant services organization in the Mid-Atlantic region, and he’s advocated on those topics with national television appearances on C-Span, and a national rally, which he helped organize, in 2013 in Washington, D.C.
“He’s absolutely synonymous with CASA,” said Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), who chairs the Legislative Latino Caucus.
Before Martinez’s election to the House of Delegates, he worked as a research and policy analyst for CASA from 2020 to 2022.
During Martinez’s time, he spent a month in Georgia when CASA’s sister organization, CASA In Action, helping to mobilize Latino voters during the 2020 election to get Democrats Ralphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff elected to the U.S. Senate.
“I think the biggest lesson that Gustavo taught me was about courage. He always took on fights that were worth it. He was always focused on the most marginalized among us, because he understood, if we improve their conditions, all of our lives become better,” Martinez, 29, said in an interview Thursday. “I’ve always taken that courage is the center of leadership.”
That courage from Torres continues to ensure immigration topics remain in the public discourse in Maryland. The organization has built coalitions with other advocacy groups to expand other services and programs for immigrants such as health care, voting rights and legal services.
Del. Deni Taveras (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the organization’s headquarters, said under Torres’s “fearless leadership,” several pieces of legislation became state law. Some of those include allowing residents to obtain a driver’s license regardless of their immigration status; expanding Medicaid to cover prenatal and postpartum care to those who are pregnant regardless of immigration status; and protecting residents on how to deal with immigration enforcement agents at “sensitive locations” such as a public library, public school and hospitals.
In terms of the immediate future, Taveras said, “This is an opportunity to be introspective and strategic in their [CASA leadership] thinking on how they would like to move forward. We’re going to be right there alongside them as we celebrate Gustavo, and as we work with them to see what their next chapter will look like.”
Fighting Trump, winning elections
Before President Donald Trump (R) was sworn into office in January for a second time, CASA held a “Know Your Rights” events to prepare for enforcement actions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The organization gained experience from the first Trump administration. However, for his second term the president signed executive orders on the first day, including an order to deny citizenship to certain U.S. born children whose parents are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
“I never imagined that we are going to have that kind of leadership in this country,” Torres said. “We say, ‘Oh my God, we made a mistake [the first time].’ But now twice. That is no longer a mistake. Something is very rooted in our country that we need to think about what happened and why this kind of situation is happening.”
One strategy Torres proposes is simple: have politicians speak directly “to Black and brown communities where they are.” One person who he said did that was New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old state assembly member who won the city’s Democratic primary last month.
“What this gentleman did in New York was something very, very powerful,” Torres said. “He went to listen to them. As a good organizer, that is exactly what we need to do.”
He continued: “The leadership in the Democratic Party and other different institutions just go and do those polls and [look at] numbers and hire these big corporate, big companies to do the assessment and [spend] millions of dollars in the campaigns. They don’t speak about affordability. You need to listen to our community. That is how you build power and the capacity to win elections.”
‘Tough moment’
Not all 34 years with the organization have been easy.
It endured controversy in November 2023, after some members issued statements and social media posts expressing solidarity with Palestinians during the war in Gaza that began Oct. 7 of that year.
It led some lawmakers, including Montgomery County’s Senate delegation to publicly scrutinize CASA and threatened to pull public funding. Private donors also announced they would withdraw funding. CASA released a public apology from Torres in response.
Torres acknowledged that it was “a very tough moment” for the organization.
“What I’ve learned from that is was a very difficult moment, but we are going to keep demanding for peace and dignity for everybody, for Palestinian and for Israel,” he said. “We are going to keep doing that, and that is going to be our position about that forever.”
During this year’s 90-day legislative session, CASA leaders lobbied in Annapolis for legislation to prohibit local police from entering into 287(g) agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the 287(g) ban, the biggest loss for immigration advocates this year.
Although that part of the legislation wasn’t included the sensitive locations provision was.
“This is an extraordinary victory that we got to celebrate. We are very grateful for what [the legislature] did in protection of our community,” Torres said.
And, he said advocates will be back next year to push for restriction of 287(g) agreements. One main reason, he said, stems from the Trump administration using that as “a loophole…to arrest and kidnap people who live in Maryland” such as Kilmar Abrego Garica. Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, is both a union worker and member of CASA.
“We are going back in 2026 to convince our policy makers, our friends, the governor, that it’s the right thing to do,” Torres said.
Family time
Well, Torres himself may not come back right away after his retirement becomes official. He plans to spend time with family for at least six months. He may do some work as a consultant.
“But right now, I’m focused on my family,” he said.
Torres and his wife, Sonia Mora, an assistant chief administrative officer for the Montgomery County government, don’t have children of their own, but he plans to enjoy some time with his nieces and nephews.
But before he does that, he has a message to share with Maryland’s immigrant community, including its 250,000 green card holders: “I beg you. This is so very, very important that you become U.S. citizens to protect your rights and your family’s rights,” he said. “When you are U.S. citizen, you have more rights for you and your family, and then you can register to vote and make a decision to vote for whatever you want to vote.”
Some residents, who speak limited English, fear the Trump administration’s tactics to arrest people for simply “being from a Black or brown community.”
“That is the reason why CASA exists to help you in that. We navigate all of those systems. Just call us and we take care of that,” he said. “We’re here to help.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230322TorresGustavo03-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)As the battle for Virginia’s House of Delegates heats up, both major parties are zeroing in on a small number of suburban swing districts that could ultimately decide which side holds the majority come January.
Among the most closely watched races this year are contests in Chesterfield, Williamsburg, Chesapeake, Prince William, and Hampton — five competitive districts that reflect broader political shifts in Virginia and where both parties are making heavy investments in money, message, and manpower, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project.
While Democrats currently hold the majority, their grip on the 100-seat chamber is slim. 
With every seat on the ballot this November — along with races for governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general — the stakes are unusually high. And both sides say they’re ready.
House Democrats are touting historic momentum this cycle, running candidates in all 100 districts for the first time in recent history — including in reliably Republican areas where they haven’t competed in years. 
Their campaign arm recently announced a $9 million TV ad reservation, covering the state’s four biggest media markets — Washington, Richmond, Norfolk, and Roanoke — with more than $8.5 million slated for the final three weeks of the campaign.
“This is how we not only protect our majority, but expand it,” said House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement. “House Democrats aren’t just reacting — we’re setting the pace. This ad buy is about making sure voters hear directly from us, early and often, about what we’re doing to protect their freedoms, lower costs, and move Virginia forward.”
Republicans, meanwhile, are focused on the districts most likely to determine the balance of power. 
While they’re fielding candidates in 83 districts — short of a full slate — party leaders say that’s by design. They argue Democrats are spreading themselves thin in unwinnable territory, while Republicans are concentrating on a narrower, more winnable map.
“They’ve got candidates in 20 of the reddest districts who are going to raise $1,000 — do you think that concerns us even a little bit?” Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake told The Mercury. “I don’t think (Democrats) have as much enthusiasm as we do.”
Peake said GOP House Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, is working hard to raise funds and support candidates across the state, particularly in the 10 to 15 districts seen as most contested. 
“We are fully competitive in all of those, with fundraising and quality candidates who are well known in their communities and working extremely hard,” he said.
Political analysts say the terrain slightly favors Democrats this year, especially in fast-changing outer suburban areas. 
“It’s no surprise that the most competitive districts right now are in Republican hands,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “This is an environment where Republicans are facing significant headwinds for a bunch of reasons, and that’s creating a tailwind that would help Democrats who, in other years, might be more vulnerable.”
Farnsworth pointed to the suburbs of Chesterfield County and Prince William as key bellwethers. 
“The action in this election cycle in Virginia is largely in these outer-ring suburban counties,” he said. “The rural areas tend to be very red, and the urban areas more Democratic. But those transitional places are where Republican fortunes are particularly at risk this year.”
Democrats and Republicans alike agree that a few closely contested races will likely determine the House majority — and perhaps the direction of state government under a new governor.
Here’s a closer look at five of the most competitive House districts in Virginia this year.
 House District 75

In a high-stakes rematch, Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, faces Democrat Lindsey Dougherty once again in a district that’s seen its political balance shift in recent years and that is shaping up to be this cycle’s most competitive contest. 
Covering parts of Chesterfield and Prince George counties and the city of Hopewell, this district leans slightly Republican, but not decisively. 
Vice President Kamala Harris carried it in 2024 with 52.3%, while GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump pulled 46.2%. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., performed even better, winning 54.6% to Hung Cao’s 45.2%. Yet just three years earlier, in Virginia’s previous gubernatorial election, Republican Glenn Youngkin bested Democrat Terry McAuliffe here by a solid 8-point margin.
Coyner, a moderate Republican and attorney who previously served on the Chesterfield County School Board, was first elected in 2019 after defeating Dougherty with 55.1%. She’s known for occasionally bucking her party, notably voting to abolish the death penalty and protect same-sex marriage in Virginia. 
Dougherty, originally from Knoxville, Tennessee, has made her mark in Virginia as a dedicated volunteer advocating for children’s health care and support for single mothers. 
Coyner enters the fall with a financial advantage, raising $546,436 to Dougherty’s $227,774 — despite Democrats’ broader statewide edge in campaign cash.
 House District 71

Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County, is seeking reelection in a district where the GOP holds a narrow edge — but recent Democratic victories suggest the race could go either way. 
The 71st spans parts of James City and New Kent counties, as well as Williamsburg. Harris narrowly won the district in 2024 with 51.5%, and Kaine topped Cao here 52.3% to 47.5%. However, Youngkin beat McAuliffe in 2021 by nearly 8 points, and the area has reliably leaned red in most past cycles.
Batten, first elected in 2019, chairs the House Republican Caucus and leads the “Purple Caucus,” an informal coalition of Republicans in politically vulnerable districts. She previously worked for GOP leaders in the General Assembly. 
Her Democratic challenger, Jessica Anderson, is a lifelong Virginian from Newport News with a background in the insurance industry.
This cycle, Democrats are signaling they see an opportunity: Anderson has narrowly outraised Batten, pulling in $356,915 compared to the incumbent’s $305,863.
 House District 89

With Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake, stepping down after one term, the open-seat contest in District 89 is drawing serious attention from both parties. The district, covering parts of Chesapeake and Suffolk, leans Republican by just over two points — and recent election results paint a mixed picture. 
Harris edged Trump here in 2024, 50.1% to 47.2%, and Kaine performed even better, winning by over five points. Youngkin, however, beat McAuliffe by more than 7 points in 2021.
Republican Mike Lamonea, a retired Homeland Security special agent, is facing Democrat Karen Carnegie, an attorney and community activist with deep ties to local civic groups, including the Girl Scouts and the Ruritan Club. Carnegie’s strong community presence and local activism make her a formidable opponent in a competitive landscape.
She’s also ahead in fundraising, with $205,436 to Lamonea’s $194,811 — a tight margin that mirrors the race itself.
 House District 22

Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, is looking to hold onto his seat in one of the most closely watched matchups in Northern Virginia. He faces a challenge from Elizabeth Guzman, who represented a neighboring district from 2018 to 2024 and is aiming for a return to the House. 
District 22 includes parts of Prince William County and leans slightly Republican.
The margins here have been razor-thin. In 2024, Harris edged Trump 49% to 47.9%, and Kaine carried the district by just over 2 points. Guzman, who unseated a longtime Republican in 2017, ran unsuccessfully for state Senate in 2022 but remains a well-known figure in the region.
She’s also leading financially, with $402,989 raised compared to Lovejoy’s $250,858. Lovejoy, a former Manassas City Ccouncil member and small business owner, won his first term in 2023 and is now defending it in what could become a costly, hard-fought race.
 House District 86

Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, the only Black Republican in the House of Delegates, is in a tough reelection battle against Democrat Virgil Thornton in a district that has become a top target for Democrats. Covering Poquoson, parts of Hampton and York County, the 86th leans Republican — but just barely. In 2024, Harris eked out a win over Trump by 1.1 points, and Kaine took it by a margin of less than 3 points over Cao.
Cordoza won the seat in 2021 and has since attracted statewide GOP support. Concerned about holding the district, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the full Republican statewide ticket — including Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, AG Jason Miyares, and GOP gubernatorial nominee John Reid — recently headlined a joint fundraiser for him in Hampton, despite internal fractions between the candidates. 
Thornton, a community leader running on a platform of economic justice and public safety reform, has outraised Cordoza with $149,805 to the incumbent’s $106,283 — another sign Democrats believe this district could be a sleeper flip.

Mark Warner (D-VA)at a committee hearing in the U.S. Capitol in December 2021. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virignia, recalls how over the years, he and colleagues in Congress used to say “we’re gonna get to housing next, we’re gonna get to housing next.” But it never really came, he said, and now “housing shortages are a real crisis.”
Last week, he called himself and his colleagues out for “kicking the can on housing” since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Though he and others had introduced proposals, the proposals haven’t always succeeded. But he’s encouraged this year, as a package of housing bills he helped craft advanced unanimously through the Senate’s Banking Committee. 
He said that the overall goal is helping states cut through red tape and build more housing to fit their residents’ needs. 
“‘Okay, locality, you don’t want the feds snooping into your zoning — but here, if we give you extra money or extra flexibility, will you be willing to lean in on speeding up the zoning and permitting process?’” Warner said the package proposes hypothetically.
For example, the package includes an “Innovation Fund” that would authorize $800 million to support locally-driven initiatives to expand housing supply and reduce costs. The Housing Supply Frameworks Act would direct the U.S. Housing and Urban Development department to create best-practice zoning and land-use frameworks as guidance for localities. The HOME Investment Partnerships Reauthorization and Improvement Act reauthorizes and updates HUD’s HOME Investments Partnerships Program to help localities facilitate construction of more affordable housing. 
The first bit of the housing bills Warner spoke of on a call with the Mercury was the RESIDE Act, which he co-authored with Indiana Republican Jim Banks. That bill would create a new pilot program to help communities convert vacant commercial buildings — derelict hotels, warehouses, or strip malls — into residential ones. 
“You’ve got deserted strip centers —  they’ve got water, they’ve got power, they’ve got broadband, they’ve got parking,” Warner said. 
Federal assistance can help communities get conversion projects over the finish line, he suggested. To achieve this, the program would operate under HUD to give grants to local governments seeking to acquire, site prep and rehabilitate blighted properties. 
It’s “low hanging fruit,” state senator Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said. Like the U.S. senator, he is also focused on housing legislation and no stranger to introducing it in Virginia.

Some advancing legislation in Warner’s package is similar to measures introduced by VanValkenburg and others at the state level. Not all of the ideas came to fruition, though, as they met concern or pushback from local governments.
Such was the case for a bill by VanValkenburg that would have required localities to adopt by-right zoning for multifamily housing near commercial and business districts, which are often also corridors with public transit. The bill failed, as did his proposal to give state government authority to step in when local governments failed to take steps to create affordable housing. 
Meanwhile, Warner’s Build More Housing Near Transit Act would amend a federal grant program to allow the Federal Transit Administration to give transit projects a higher rating if they are located in areas that adopt policies to encourage more housing near public transportation hubs. 
VanValkenburg noted that federal lawmakers can help accentuate state and local lawmakers’ efforts. 
“Subsidies are things that the federal government can really do to help jump start housing that state or local governments can’t always do in the same way,” he said. “Solutions are going to be solved, fastest, if all three levels of government are working together, and each level of government can bring something different.”
Other measures included in Warner’s housing package streamline efforts between different federal agencies to reduce funding or approval delays for things like new rural housing or preservation of existing rural homes, enhance transparency on loans for veteran homebuyers, and fund a pilot program for grants and loans to help low-and-moderate-income homeowners or certain landlords address critical home repairs and health hazards to preserve affordable housing stock. 
With an estimated shortage of 4.5 million homes nationally, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, lawmakers at all levels are exploring how the public sector can help the private sector. 
Dubbed the Bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, Warner is hopeful that the housing package stands a good chance to become law. 
The fact that the committee voted unanimously, he said, is something he feels “pretty darn good about.”

Glenn Youngkin wants to bring a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) to Southwest Virginia in the course of the next decade. The administration has put together a small amount of funding to search for a larger amount of funding to pay for a study. One of the study questions is what they would use the reactor for – research, possibly, and to provide electricity for the University of Virginia at Wise, or perhaps a data center that the region has yet to attract.
Virginia takes steps to bring advanced nuclear reactor to Wise County

If this all sounds a little sketchy, that’s because SMRs remain a little sketchy. Nuclear companies haven’t yet demonstrated they can attain the holy grail of safe, 24/7 carbon-free power at a competitive cost.  
It’s not for lack of trying. At last count, the Nuclear Energy Agency was tracking some 98 different design technologies around the world for SMRs ranging in size from 1 MW microreactors to utility-scale reactors of more than 300 MW. Only a handful of these have reached the construction phase, and none are operational in the U.S. 
This meager track record hardly reflects the enthusiasm surrounding the industry. It’s not just politicians and profit-seekers; many climate advocates believe the industry must succeed if the world is to have any hope of transitioning our energy supply away from fossil fuels. And polling shows that 56% of the public supports building more nuclear plants. That’s way less than the levels of support for wind and solar but more than support for fracking and coal mining. Still, concerns remain about safety and the proliferation of nuclear waste, a problem neither the industry nor the government yet has a strategy to deal with.
And then there’s the cost. SMRs haven’t shown an ability to compete in the energy marketplace, even against other carbon-free alternatives. As renewable energy and storage technologies continue to drop in price, the economic case for new nuclear remains an open question. 
Nonetheless, both of Virginia’s publicly-owned utilities are exploring SMRs, having secured legislation last year that will allow them to charge customers for millions of dollars in early development costs. Appalachian Power is targeting a site near Lynchburg (not Southwest Virginia), while Dominion Energy says it is evaluating the feasibility of an SMR next to its existing conventional reactors at North Anna. 
Dominion’s 2024 integrated resource plan shows an SMR could be part of its power mix as early as 2035; APCo has no timeline. For either utility, actually building an SMR will require making the economic case to the State Corporation Commission.  
The slow timeline and cloudy cost picture have not dampened enthusiasm for nuclear among Virginia’s elected leaders. The data center boom is exacerbating a shortage of energy and causing utility bills to skyrocket. Keeping the party going means making messy tradeoffs between polluting fuels with volatile prices and low-cost but land-hungry solar. No wonder Youngkin and other leaders hope nuclear will magically allow them to sidestep the hard decisions and party on.
Energy demands, regulations and federal funding challenge Virginia Clean Economy Act

But wishful thinking doesn’t put megawatts on the grid. A recent article surveying the state of the nuclear industry makes it clear that these are early times in the nuclear renaissance, if such it is. The industry won’t be able to scale unless and until production-line manufacturing becomes a reality, and that will be years from now. 
Fortunately for the nuclear industry, it has always been a darling of U.S. policymakers, and that remains true. Nuclear subsidies survived the axe in this year’s Republican budget law, while tax credits for wind and solar were revoked. 
Indeed, President Donald J. Trump is doing his best to further the industry’s prospects, albeit in a ham-handed fashion that almost seems calculated to erode public trust. 
Last month a representative of his Department of Government Efficiency reportedly told the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with ensuring the safety of the industry, that it was expected to provide “rubber stamp” approval to nuclear plant applications after they were tested by the Department of Energy or Defense. A few days later, Trump dismissed all but one of the members of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which provides oversight of spent fuel storage.  
These alarming moves may not do much to dampen the enthusiasm of the Youngkin administration and other boosters. The administration even hopes to lure nuclear manufacturing to Virginia – but it would be in Lynchburg, not Southwest Virginia. 
That calls into question Youngkin’s claims of economic benefits for an SMR in Wise County. If the SMR would be just a one-off for “research” purposes and needs a rich company or state-supported customer to buy the electricity, is it really an investment in the region, or a solution in search of a problem?
Many local residents are skeptical of the administration’s plans, trusting neither the governor nor the nuclear industry. Sharon Fisher, one of the leaders of the Southwest Virginia Nuclear Watch grassroots movement, told me in an email that her group “has extensively researched the nuclear industry with its enormous costs and contaminations.” 
 She pointed me to a 2023 study of health trends in a Tennessee county where a company called Nuclear Fuel Services generates highly enriched uranium fuels for naval reactors. Over the years, unintended releases of enriched uranium, plutonium and other substances have caused an accumulation of radioactivity in the local air, water, and food. The study documented rising cancer and mortality rates in the county, including a rate of premature deaths that is 61% above the U.S. average.   
Rees Shearer, an activist with the Appalachian Peace Education Center, told me in a phone call that SMRs are “the next wave of exploitation” of Southwest Virginia’s resources.
“First they came for the timber, then they came for the coal, now they are coming with radioactivity,” Shearer said.
He explained, “Coal left a terrible legacy of abandoned mines, polluted creeks, and leaking methane. But this pales compared to the potential legacy of high-level nuclear waste stored on site. With SMRs, the amount of this waste can be 100 times more per megawatt than conventional nuclear. This is waste that will last millions of years. This isn’t a fair trade.”
An SMR would also come with the risk of terrorism, either from hacking or a drone attack. “It makes a place that was never a target into a target,” he noted.
Both Fisher and Shearer challenged the notion that SMRs would provide jobs for Wise County residents, even in the construction phase. Modular facilities would be manufactured offsite and assembled by an expert crew from out of the area. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has even approved remote operation of nuclear reactors from an offsite facility, they pointed out.
Well-paying jobs are certainly a priority for the area. Unemployment rates for Southwest Virginia counties have risen only slightly from their Biden-era lows, but poverty rates in some counties remain stubbornly high.
But Fisher says the key to a healthy economy lies in diversification. 
“Wise County was once a major producer of apples. We have vineyards and breweries, and fields for growing grains. Tourism is growing. (We should be) investing in local entrepreneurs and farmers. (And) getting equitable tax revenues from the thousands of large absentee landholdings, which should be used for housing and development.” 
Energy jobs needn’t be off the table, but, said Shearer, “We think the better approach is to put solar on the abandoned mines. We have a ready workforce already trained to do this.” He pointed to an effort already underway that’s being spearheaded by the environmental group Appalachian Voices. 
What the region shouldn’t do, concluded Fisher, is “rely on one industry again that puts our lives and land at tremendous risk.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and 16 states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published this week by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)On Aug. 1, New York became the sixth state to offer free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons.
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

Federal employees may start seeing and hearing more about religion in the workplace, following new guidance from the Trump administration.
All federal employees must be allowed to express their religion at work, the Office of Personnel Management told agencies in a memo last week — as long as it doesn’t interfere with business operations.
Park rangers, for instance, can join a group in prayer when leading a national park tour. And doctors working at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital can pray over patients for their recovery, OPM explained. Security guards are also allowed to display religious items at the front desk of a federal office building.
And as long as it doesn’t rise to the level of harassment, OPM said federal employees are also allowed to try to persuade their coworkers of the “correctness of their own religious views.”
“During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,” OPM said. “However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request.”
OPM Director Scott Kupor said in the memo that agencies should “robustly protect and enforce” federal employees’ religious expressions in the workplace “to the greatest extent possible.”
“Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,” Kupor said. “This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths. Under President Trump’s leadership, we are restoring constitutional freedoms and making government a place where people of faith are respected, not sidelined.”

OPM clarified that agencies cannot punish federal employees for expressing their religious beliefs at the office — for instance, by having religious items displayed on their desks, wearing clothing or jewelry with religious symbols, or discussing religion with coworkers. Federal employees can also display upcoming religious events on communal bulletin boards in the workplace.
Federal supervisors and non-supervisors should also be treated the same when it comes to the ability to freely express their religion, according to OPM’s new guidance. If an employee is unwilling to engage in religious conversations with a supervisor, however, OPM said that the employee cannot be disciplined for it.
Jim Eisenmann, a federal employment attorney and partner at Alden Law Group, said affording more flexibility to federal supervisors in their religious expressions may still lead to some blurred lines in the workplace.
“Supervisors are in a special position in the federal workforce. They hold power and control over employees, employee assignments and employee performance appraisals,” Eisenmann said. “In the past, supervisors had to be very discerning and careful about having any discussions about religion or having religious displays in their offices. They were discouraged from doing that because people could perceive it a certain way, and it could lead to complaints of religious discrimination.”
Under the new guidance, agencies also have to let federal employees privately engage in religious expressions in the workplace. But agencies can still limit the amount of time and determine the places that federal employees are allowed to do so, OPM said.
Federal employees are allowed to engage in religious expressions in groups as well — as long as those expressions don’t happen during “on-duty time,” OPM said. For instance, OPM explained that if an employee asks a supervisor to shut down a coworkers’ gathering for prayer in an empty conference room, the supervisor should “politely” say that the coworkers’ gathering is allowed, and that it can continue.
The guidance for “on-duty time,” however, may also lead to some confusion about when employees are or aren’t technically working, and when they are allowed to express their religion, Eisenmann said.
“The vast majority of federal employees are not punching a clock, so it’s not going to be clear,” Eisenmann said. “If I knock on my boss’ office door and ask to chat, and they’re just reading the Bible, do I know they’re on a break? To me, the distinction can be lost.”

OPM’s guidance comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February, calling for the eradication of “anti-Christian bias.” Trump’s order established a new task force responsible, in part, for reviewing agencies’ activities to identify and eliminate any “anti-Christian policies, practices or conduct,” the White House said in a Feb. 6 fact sheet.
The VA, for one, launched a task force in April to investigate instances of “anti-Christian bias” — in particular, seeking cases where employees believed they were denied promotions for religious reasons, or faced retaliation for seeking a religious exemption to vaccine mandates.
The new guidance aligns with the unanimous June 2023 Supreme Court decision in Groff v. DeJoy, which determined that all employers, including federal agencies, must grant religious accommodations to employees, unless doing so would create an “undue hardship” to business operations. The court’s decision made it harder for employers in and out of government to deny religious accommodations in the workplace.
OPM additionally referenced protections of religious freedom for individuals, including federal employees, afforded under Title VII and the Constitution.
The new guidance is OPM’s second action this month, calling for more flexibility for federal employees “of faith.” On July 16, OPM also encouraged agencies to grant telework exemptions to federal employees for religious purposes — carving out some limited exceptions to Trump’s broad return-to-office orders across the executive branch. The Trump administration said federal employees can request exemptions to telework, for instance, when observing religious holidays, attending services or fasting.
“The federal workforce should be a welcoming place for federal employees who practice a religious faith,” Kupor said. “Allowing religious discrimination in the federal workplace violates the law. It also threatens to adversely impact recruitment and retention of highly-qualified employees of faith.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-475978260-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-08-04 07:57:10.850049

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
Offshore wind leasing is effectively dead in the U.S. following a Trump administration order issued last week.


Large swaths of U.S. waters that had been identified by federal agencies as ideal for offshore wind are no longer eligible for such developments under an Interior Department statement released Wednesday.


In the four-sentence statement, the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said the U.S. government is ​“de-designating over 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.”


The move comes just a day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered his staff to stop ​“preferential treatment for wind projects” and falsely called wind energy ​“unreliable.” Analysts say that offshore wind power can be a reliable form of carbon-free energy, especially in New England, where the region’s grid operator has called it critical to grid stability. It also follows the Trump administration’s monthslong assault on the industry, which has included multiple attacks on in-progress projects.
Amid federal setbacks, Maine ‘closely tracking’ development of Canadian offshore wind



The outlook was already grim for new offshore wind leasing activity following President Donald Trump’s executive order in January that introduced a temporary ban on the practice. Wednesday’s announcement makes that policy more definitive. Wind power advocates say it will erase several years of work from federal agencies and local communities to determine the best possible areas for wind development.


“My read on this is that there is not going to be any leasing for offshore wind in the near future,” said a career employee at the Interior Department, who Canary Media granted anonymity to speak freely for fear of retribution.


Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official ​“wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.

Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as ​“Central Atlantic 2,” which started back in 2023 and is now dead in the water.


The draft area — or ​“call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby wind turbines could interfere with the agency’s instrumentation and radio frequencies.


The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was hosting in-person public meetings from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Morehead City, North Carolina, to gather input from fishermen, tourism outfitters, and other stakeholders. Under a wind-friendly administration, a final designation and lease sale notice would have likely been released this year or by 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.


But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.


Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s ​“big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.


Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2 and similar areas, like one near Guam, and also revokes completely finalized wind energy areas with strong state support. One example is in the Gulf of Maine, where Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for the emerging renewable sector.


These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.

Ever since North Carolina legislators established the so-called “Opportunity Scholarships” school voucher program, sponsors and proponents have pitched it as a means of helping low-income students escape struggling public schools.
Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, a new report from the Department of Public Instruction shows that this was all baloney. The DPI researchers found that just sixty-seven hundred of the state’s eighty-thousand-plus vouchers in the current school year went to students who had attended a North Carolina public school in the prior year.
And while the data for kindergartners
were not yet available, it’s clear that as much as ninety percent or more of new vouchers in 24-25 were for students who have never attended a public school.
In other words, the vast majority of voucher money is going to parents – most of them well-off – who never had any intention of sending their kids to public schools.
The bottom line: School vouchers in our state have nothing to do with quote “opportunity” and everything to do with undermining and privatizing public education. Other explanations are simply false.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Millions of dollars in federal budget cuts to public media have been finalized by President Donald Trump, but state lawmakers in Ohio also made budget cuts in funds mean for public broadcasting, including services for the blind.
Trump signed away $9 billion in previously approved spending on July 24, which included more than $1 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the next two fiscal years. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes federal funds to public media stations including NPR and PBS affiliates in Ohio.
The U.S. House cleared the legislation on a mostly party-line vote, with only one Ohio Republican, Rep. Mike Turner, voting against the measure. All House Democrats voted against it.
But lesser known cuts were made in the state budget, via earmarks in the Broadcast Educational Media Commission.
The commission is a independent state agency that has been around for 60 years. The mission statement for the commission says it seeks to support and fund public television and radio services, including delivering “educational programming and broadcasting solutions statewide.”

The commission “seeks to expand the knowledge of Ohio’s citizens through promotion of educational broadcasting products, funding of the state’s broadcast affiliates and organizations, and collaboration with stakeholders and advocates of technology-driven education,” according to the state’s official website on the commission.
The site states the commission provides “financial assistance and technical services” to eight public TV stations, 15 public radio stations, and six “radio reading services” for the blind.
Those receiving operating subsidies distributed through the commission include The Ohio Channel, which provides recorded and livestream access to government press conferences and meetings, including Ohio General Assembly hearings and sessions.
In total, the state budgeted $10.6 million each to the commission in fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The newest state budget, signed by Gov. Mike DeWine at the end of June, reduces the commission’s budget by 3% in 2026 and 5% in 2027. While it still includes support for The Ohio Channel and Ohio’s Statehouse News Bureau, among others, earmarks for specific resources have been cut.
DeWine’s budget proposed up to $965,000 in each fiscal year to be distributed equally among “Ohio’s educational television stations for the production of interactive instructional programming, with priority given to resources aligned with state academic content standards,” according to budget documents.
But the final budget included Ohio Senate-introduced changes, providing more than $120,000 less than the governor’s proposal in fiscal year 2026, and more than $240,000 less in 2027.
More funding intended to support public educational television and radio operations was cut from DeWine’s proposed $2.65 million in each fiscal year, to $2.3 million in 2026 and $1.9 million in 2027.
A third line item under the Broadcast Educational Media Commission’s budget is specifically intended for radio reading services for the blind. While DeWine’s budget set the earmark at up to $294,000 each for the next two years, the legislature ended up cutting that appropriation by more than $37,000 in 2026 and more than $75,000 in 2027.
Outlets in the state are now preparing to lose their shares of the federal funding, with many worried about smaller local stations who serve as the only news outlets for certain areas, and as emergency alert stations as well.
Luke Dennis, general manager of WYSO in Yellow Springs, told the Capital Journal earlier this month that public media is, “in many places, the only media,” and for those without internet access or the ability to afford it, public media can mean the only source of needed information.
“There’s a very well-established infrastructure for emergency alerts that are made possible through public media,” Dennis said as the federal funding cuts were still being discussed.
WYSO could be looking at about $300,000 in cuts on the federal side, and that may mean a new budget plan. Dennis said that back up plan for funding comes at a time when the station is newly independent, and working on a “lean and mean” budget.
Ideastream, which partners with the state to provide The Ohio Channel’s services, said in June they may have to look at “consolidation” because of the cuts.

Houston Gaines, an Athens Republican, became the first major contender to announce a bid for Georgia's 10th Congressional District. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file photo)It had only been roughly 72 hours since U.S. Rep. Mike Collins launched his run for U.S. Senate before we landed our first big candidate for his congressional seat.
State Rep. Houston Gaines, a Republican from Athens, announced Thursday that he’s running in what is likely to become a crowded primary for Collins’ District 10 congressional seat, which reaches across 18 counties from the eastern edges of metro Atlanta to the South Carolina state line.
“Being your State Representative for the last seven years has been the honor of a lifetime,” Gaines said in a note on social media announcing his congressional run. “Together, we’ve accomplished so much. But it’s time to take the fight to Washington, D.C. If we’re ever going to turn this country around, we need good, common sense people to run for Congress to help President Trump continue to deliver for the American people.”
Gaines’ candidacy is far from a surprise. A former student body president at the University of Georgia, the young legislator was always thought to have congressional aspirations but had declined to run in previous open races for this seat. 
The then-23-year-old Gaines first arrived at the state Capitol in 2018 after defeating Democratic State Rep. Deborah Gonzalez in a competitive district that combined liberal Athens-Clarke County with a trio of Republican-friendly counties nearby. He has routinely won re-election by wide margins in the years since.
In the statehouse, Gaines wasted no time climbing the Republican ranks: He now serves as the vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee and also holds a caucus leadership role. As a Republican lawmaker from a left-leaning college town, Gaines has repeatedly butted heads with his hometown’s liberal city officials over immigration and law enforcement. He is also an important political ally and personal friend of Gov. Brian Kemp, whose Athens home lies in Gaines’ legislative district.
Gaines is hoping to cement his status as an early frontrunner, raising more than half a million dollars in his first 24 hours in the race. But other Republicans are likely to join the race soon.
Topping the list of potential candidates is Collins’ predecessor, former U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, who left Congress in 2022 to wage a Trump-backed bid for Secretary of State. And Paul Broun, another ex-congressman who ironically gave up his seat for an ill-fated Senate run, is said to be eyeing a return to Washington.
Two names you can’t expect to hear? State Sens. Brian Strickland of McDonough and Bill Cowsert of Athens, who are both running in the Republican primary for state attorney general and just so happen to be residents of GA-10.
On the Democratic side, 2024 nominee Lexy Doherty is running for the second time. But any Democrat will face long odds in a district where roughly three of every five voters backed President Donald Trump last year over Vice President Kamala Harris.
“We need our government to work with us, not against us, to make a better life for us and our families,” Doherty told the AJC. “And all we’ve gotten this year from extremists like Collins is chaos and corruption while the ultrarich take tighter control of Washington.”

The alarm rings early for work, but sleep is short, and exhaustion looms large over ever-accumulating bills and a monthly paycheck that won’t stretch far enough. With fingers crossed, the car — on its last legs but too expensive to repair — starts up. Otherwise, it could have been a late arrival to the office or a full day of missed wages. These experiences aren’t an anomaly for ALICE. They’re an everyday reality.
Despite facing persistent challenges, our ALICE neighbors continually step up and serve our communities, including on the front lines of local nonprofits.
According to Zip Recruiter, the average nonprofit salary in Arkansas is $36,000. Meanwhile, for a Pulaski County household with just one adult and a child under the age of two, the survival budget — the minimum cost to live and work in today’s economy — is $49,380.
Today, our ALICE neighbors are working harder than ever, particularly those in the nonprofit sector. When economic uncertainty rises, so does our collective need for services. Combine that with dwindling federal funding, and charitable organizations already under tight budgets are now doing more with fewer resources. At the same time, employees of these organizations, who often wear multiple hats, are taking on additional responsibilities for the same pay.
So, how can we better support ALICE employees while advancing their efforts on behalf of our community? A great place to start is empowering nonprofits — and organizations of all sectors — to implement policies and procedures that create environments where all employees can thrive. With a more equitable workplace, data shows that individuals feel more engaged, which in turn improves productivity, reduces turnover and creates stronger organizations.
That’s just what ALICE@Work aims to do. With the support of the Heart of Arkansas United Way, Blue & You Foundation, Entergy Arkansas, Delta Dental of Arkansas Foundation and Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, business and nonprofit leaders are uncovering the unique challenges that their ALICE employees face.
First up were financial institutions. Now, Central Arkansas nonprofits are participating in the second ALICE@Work cohort. During the process, they’ll complete a workforce assessment and receive regular education in five key areas: benefits and compensation, scheduling and flexibility, professional development, work support and resources, and financial wellness. This hands-on training will enable organizations to develop individualized action plans in alignment with their culture and values.
ALICE@Work is a pragmatic solution to tackling systemic challenges for our state, where nearly half of Arkansas households struggle to make ends meet. As our neighbors’ needs grow and the federal funding landscape continues to evolve, this initiative benefits not only ALICE workers but participating organizations and the broader community. By recognizing the vital role ALICE workers play in our organizations, we can help strengthen our state together.",,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

Despite the strength of the U.S. economy, the gap between rich and poor Americans is increasing.

The wealthiest 1% of Americans have more than five times as much wealth as the bottom 50%, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. That’s up from four times as much in the year 2000. In 2024 alone, the wealthiest 19 families got a total of US$1 trillion richer – the largest one-year increase on record.
And yet 59% of Americans don’t have enough money saved up to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense.
We are political scientists who study human rights and political economy.
In a 2023 study, our team looked at 145 countries, including the U.S., to understand the link between labor rights and inequality. We found evidence that strengthening collective labor rights may reduce economic inequality.
 Empowering workers

Collective labor rights include the rights to form and join a union, bargain collectively for higher pay and better working conditions, go on strike, and get justice if employers punish workers who exercise these rights.
In the U.S., where less than 10% of workers belong to unions, union members typically earn higher wages than their nonunion counterparts.
Through negotiations on behalf of their members, unions can pressure employers to provide fair wages and benefits. If negotiations break down, the union can call for a strike – sometimes winning better benefits and higher wages as a result.
Some U.S. unions don’t have the right to strike, including air traffic controllers, teachers and those working on national security issues. But most unions have some ability to implement work stoppages and impose costs on employers to negotiate for raises and better benefits and conditions.
 Reducing inequality

For our study, we analyzed the human rights in the CIRIGHTS dataset, which uses human rights reports from the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International and other sources to measure government respect for 24 human rights, including the rights to unionize and bargain collectively. The dataset is produced by the University of Rhode Island, Binghamton University and the University of Connecticut. One of us, Skip Mark, serves as a co-director of the project.
Using a scoring guide, a team of researchers reads human rights reports and gives each country a score of zero if they have widespread violations, one point if they have some violations, or two if they have no evidence of violations. The team has assigned scores for all 24 rights from 1994 through 2022.
Using this data, we created a measure of collective labor rights by adding scores for the right to workplace association and the right to collective bargaining. The resulting collective labor rights score ranges from zero to four.
Countries where workers’ rights are routinely violated, such as Afghanistan, China and Saudi Arabia, scored a zero. The United States, Macedonia and Zambia, three countries with little in common, were among those that tended to get two points, placing them in the middle. Countries with no reported violations of the rights to workplace association and collective bargaining, including Canada, Sweden and France, got four points.
According to the CIRIGHTS dataset, the strength of respect for collective labor rights around the world declined by 50%, from 2.06 in 1994 to 1.03 in 2022.


At the same time, according to the World Inequality Dataset, the share of income earned by the 1% with the biggest paychecks increased by 11%.
We used advanced statistical methods to figure out whether better worker protections actually reduce inequality or are just associated with it.


 Gaps between individuals and ethnic groups

We also measured what’s been happening to economic inequality, using two common ways to track it.
One of them is vertical inequality, the gap between what people earn within a country – the rich versus the poor. The more unequal a society becomes, the higher its vertical inequality score gets. We measured it using the disposable income measure from the Gini index, a commonly used indicator of economic inequality that captures how much money individuals have to spend after taxes and government transfers.
We found that a one-point increase in collective labor rights on our four-point scale reduces vertical inequality by 10 times the average change in inequality. For the U.S., a one-point increase in collective labor rights would be about enough to undo the increase in inequality that occurred between 2008 and 2010 due to the Great Recession and its aftermath. It would also likely help stem the growing wealth gap between Black and white Americans. That’s because income disparities compound over time to create wealth gaps.
We also assessed the connection between horizontal inequality, which measures income inequality between ethnic or other groups, and collective labor rights.
Negative horizontal inequality measures the amount of a country’s income held by the poorest ethnic group. Higher scores for this metric indicate that the lowest-earning ethnic group has less income relative to the rest of society. Black Americans have the lowest median income of any racial or ethnic group, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Positive horizontal inequality measures the income earned by the richest ethnic group. When positive horizontal inequality rises, that means the richest ethnic group has more income relative to the rest of society. According to the same Census Bureau report, Asian Americans had the highest median earnings.
We found that stronger collective labor rights, both in law and in practice around the world, also reduce both types of horizontal inequality. This means they raise the floor by helping to improve the income of the poorest ethnic groups in society. They also close the gap by limiting the incomes of the richest ethnic group, which can reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
That is, our findings suggest that when workers are free to advocate for higher wages and better benefits for themselves, it also benefits society as a whole.

(Photo by Vanesa Brashier/Bluebonnetnews.com)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and 16 states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.

Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Alabama resident Roald Hazelhoff treasures his newly won right to vote. When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
Why Republican-led states keep leaving a group that verifies voter rolls

“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
Republicans scrutinize voting rolls and ramp up for mass challenges ahead of election

The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

(Photo illustration by tolgart/Getty Images)As educators prepare for the next school year, one consideration is becoming increasingly pressing: whether and how to embrace AI in schools.
The U.S. Department of Education sent a letter last month reminding educators — including those in New Hampshire — of the opportunity to use federal funds toward artificial intelligence learning tools. 
And this summer, a coalition of New Hampshire groups has produced 77 pages of guidelines for teachers and school administrators to responsibly use those AI tools.
“We have to buckle down and understand it, so that we can help kids be prepared for it,” said Ellen Hume-Howard, the executive director of the New Hampshire Learning Institute, which helped create the guidelines. “And people don’t like change — they don’t like to do things they haven’t done, but that’s what it means to be an educator.”
The letter and guidance have come as New Hampshire schools have increased their use of AI. The state Department of Education has partnered with Khan Academy to provide “Khanmigo,” an AI–powered tutoring program for children, in New Hampshire schools. That program is provided for free by Khan Academy, with no state or local funding required. 
But a number of other programs for schools have emerged that are powered by generative AI, such as Curipod, Book Creator AI, WriteReader, MagicSchool.ai, Eduaide.ai, and Class Companion.
State officials have argued there is a place for AI in schools, with limits. Caitlin Davis, the new Department of Education commissioner, was asked at a hearing what she thought of AI. 
“I see it akin to a pocket calculator 50 years ago. Now, we would never say that there shouldn’t be calculators in classrooms. AI is a tool. It doesn’t replace educators. It doesn’t replace learning. And so we need to ensure that AI is instructor-led and most importantly that student privacy is at the center of all of those learning opportunities.” 
In its July 22 “Dear Colleague” letter, the federal department has listed a number of ways in which it says schools can use the federal funds, from tutoring programs to career and college guidance to learning materials.
Meanwhile, the guidelines, published in June, are designed to give schools a vision of how to proactively introduce children to AI, Hume-Howard said. She argued the technology will soon be ubiquitous, and that children should understand its benefits and risks. 
And Hume-Howard said that while cheating with AI is a problem, if schools are focused only on cracking down on student AI use, they will miss the opportunity to get ahead of the trend. 
“Running away from this would be a mistake, because we would be short-changing our learners,” she said. 
The guidelines, which were created by a team that included the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, the New Hampshire Association of School Principals, the New Hampshire School Boards Association, New Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators, and the New Hampshire Supporting Tech-using Educators, feature a roadmap for schools to implement AI policies. That includes forming an AI task force in each school, coming up with policies and rules to govern the use of AI, and developing training plans to bring educators on board. 
The guidelines also have suggestions for appropriate uses of AI. In English classes, students could use AI to have simulated conversations with characters, or to generate writing prompts, the guidelines say. In math classes, AI can help break down complicated problems, and in science class, students could use AI to analyze lab data and compare an AI interpretation of scientific findings with peer reviewed journals. 
They also name a number of concerns with AI that teachers should take into account during assignments. For instance, AI can hallucinate and give wrong information, or be biased, depending on the source material it was trained on. It can aid academic dishonesty, and it can undermine a student’s critical thinking skills if it is overused. 
The guidelines have a number of suggestions for teachers to combat these risks. “Be purposeful. Align AI use with instructional goals and outcomes — not novelty or convenience,” the guidelines state. “Be critical. Always preview and verify AI outputs for accuracy, bias, and developmental appropriateness” and “Be ethical. Model equitable, respectful, and secure uses of AI tools,” they continue. 
It is not yet clear how many New Hampshire school districts will adopt more AI-based instruction. But some teachers and administrators are showing independent interest.
In March, dozens of teachers assembled at the New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord to attend a daylong workshop on the topic. Day of AI, an MIT-founded initiative, provides presentations to public school staff demonstrating what AI is, how to harness it in the classroom, and how to avoid its pitfalls.
“You think of a shop where there’s hammers and saws and other tools, and there’s certain jobs you should use the hammer for, and certain jobs to use the saw for, and certain jobs you should use the ruler for,” said Ethan Berman, the founder of Day of AI, in an interview. 
Administrators and teachers attending the conference said they recognized the importance of AI, even if they were wary of it. And they agreed that more schools should adopt policies regulating how to use it.
“The AI is here, and it’s not going away,” said Eric Larcomb, the principal of Memorial School in the Sanborn Regional School District.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimarketing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
Americans haven’t saved for retirement. States are creating automatic savings plans.

“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

(Photo by Mimi Ditchie Photography/Getty Images)“Why Trust Science” is the title of a book written a few years ago by Naomi Oreskes. It asks the question and provides an answer that everyone should understand. Oreskes makes the case that the scientific method and its reliance on research, publication, confirmation through repetition, and ever more research — which is all exposed to the examination and critique of a community of scientists — is the essential way to understand our world and all its parts.  
Science derives its trustworthiness from its “collective character,” in which every idea, hypothesis, or theory is exposed to rigorous review, criticism, and the requirement that the data and conclusions be replicable by other independent research. When it sometimes goes “off track,” it eventually comes to correct conclusions through this process.
In today’s world of misinformation and disinformation, which can come from many sources that purport to be based in science, citizens do not know what to trust and easily become confused by opinion and partisan claims. This is why it’s so important to get information from reliable, science-based institutions that subject their work to critical review and that are funded not by industries or political interests, but by governments, nonpolitical foundations, and sources that do not have a particular ax to grind.
One can assert, with ample evidence, that academic and other independent science is what has made America the world leader in medical science, information technology, environmental protection, space exploration, advanced energy technology, and many other fields. We have, for generations, supported with our tax dollars independent research in government agencies and at many of the world’s leading American universities, including the University of New Hampshire. Our science has fueled our technological and medical advancements and inspired generations of young people to become world leaders in their fields.
Today, that foundation of “greatness” is under extreme threat. An administration of scientifically illiterate politicians has decided that if they don’t like what science is telling them, they should simply ignore it and stop funding it. In effect, they have decided, “Don’t confuse me with the facts; I’ve already made up my mind.” Even worse, they don’t want anyone to work on science that might produce facts they disagree with.
The examples over the past few months are numerous, but here is a sampling:

Major cuts to the nation’s medical research (National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others) have undermined the basic research that is critical to ensuring the health of our nation. These include cuts of 39% to the institute that researches heart disease, 37% to the institute that researches cancer, 40% to the program that researches Alzheimer’s, and 38% to research on drug overdoses and suicide. On top of this, the replacement of independent experts on a number of medical advisory boards with people who closely adhere to the dogma of the new administration has undermined the trust of many in the medical field. Doctors have said that they can no longer fully trust federal health guidance and their patients will suffer.
Notable to us here in New England, where the incidence of Lyme disease is the highest in the nation, the program at Cornell funded by the Defense Department to develop a single accurate test for numerous tick borne diseases was eliminated. 
Staffing and budgets for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been dramatically slashed, and the Trump administration budget for next year would close 10 laboratories that research life-threatening weather disasters. The lab that flies the “hurricane hunters” into storms to collect critical data used to predict the path and intensity of hurricanes is among those to close.
The Trump administration budget eliminates funding for the Ecosystems Mission Area, a program in the US Geological Survey that studies nearly every aspect of the ecology of our landscapes and waters in the country. Decades of regular data gathering that has documented how our environment is changing both for good and bad, will be ended. Scientists say this will be a loss that cannot be easily recovered.
The current EPA says it will completely eliminate its scientific research arm. The research program is the basis for nearly all of the air, water, toxic materials, and other regulations required by federal law. The union that represents 8,000 EPA workers has said, “Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts on human health and the environment. Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.” 
Similarly, the administration has cut or proposes to cut science in the national parks, from scientists who provide educational programs to projects that study changes in the landscape over time and the impacts of rapidly melting glaciers. Managing our national parks requires science for good decision-making, and apparently that no longer matters.
As if all of this wasn’t enough to convince one that politicians and their big donors have abandoned science in favor of advancing their own power, the EPA just announced it will propose eliminating a bedrock scientific finding on climate change. Disregarding a worldwide scientific consensus that climate change endangers public health and the environment, the EPA wants to eliminate the “Endangerment Finding” that was established in 2009 and later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. In essence, Donald Trump’s EPA wants to both eliminate any information about climate change and prevent the government from taking any actions that would attempt to slow or stop it.

All this anti-science behavior is truly astonishing. If one doesn’t base decisions on facts, supported by rigorous independent science, what will decisions be based on? Political expediency? Whomever donates the most money to political campaigns?
Adding insult to injury, the White House had the audacity to issue a statement on Earth Day with this headline: “On Earth Day, We Finally Have a President Who Follows Science.”
What?  
The statement went on to list the president’s proposals to cut “wasteful” environmental regulations, champion sound forest management, “end the forced use of paper straws,” and protect public lands. Meanwhile his agencies are gutting whole areas of regulations, demanding environmental rules be suspended to increase drilling and forest cutting on public lands, undoing protections for endangered species, decimating the incentives for clean energy, and reducing fuel economy of autos, which will simply increase air pollution.  
In the face of climate disruption that is creating extreme weather events that are killing people, is our president really spending his time targeting paper straws?
No, there’s no science being followed in this White House. And it will have lasting negative impacts not only on our health and our environment, but remove us from our position as the world leader in science and technology. We will watch China and the European Union leave us behind. So much for making America great.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/yellowstone-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 04:56:15.395237

(Photo Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio General Assembly tacked an expiration date on the state’s independent campaign finance watchdog as part of the latest state budget. On Jan. 1, the Ohio Elections Commission’s responsibilities shift to a new office under the Secretary of State’s umbrella. Beyond that date-certain transfer, much of what happens next is still up in the air. In the meantime, their work continues.
The commission meets
The Ohio Elections Commission meets in a basement hearing room at the Vern Riffe Center, just across the street from the Ohio statehouse. Commissioners sit at a long table on a dais in front of several rows of sparsely filled chairs. The mood among commissioners is light-hearted and collegial. They trade jokes and tease one another about who seconded a motion first.
By and large, the cases coming before them are honest mistakes — part-time treasurers who forgot to file reports or filed them incorrectly. In one case the candidate passed away and the treasurer didn’t realize there was more he needed to do. Many of those incidents receive no penalty or a modest fine of $50-$100.

But commissioners also try to put a foot down after repeated delays. One organization has been struggling to reconstruct its books after a previous treasurer took off with their records. The commission agreed to give them another 30 days. But Commissioner Stephen Caraway warned, “I would be in favor of moving to a substantially higher fine violation, from $50 into the $1000s,” if it’s still not resolved.
In another case commissioners had to throw up their hands. Township trustee candidate Justin Peroli criticized a political mailer sent out by “a multitude of concerned citizens of Lafayette township.” It’s a bogus disclaimer, he argued, because there’s no committee with that name and no campaign finance filings for the mailer.
Commissioners were frustrated but had to dismiss the complaint because they couldn’t serve notice to the non-existent group. A representative from the Secretary of State’s office urged Peroli to file another complaint with them so they could follow up.

Where we’re headed
For the OEC’s critics in the state legislature, that feeble response to obvious violations and repeated extensions for straggling treasurers only underscore the commission’s obsolescence.
“I’ve had a four-year front row seat to how inept this process is,” state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said back in April.
The commission’s perceived shortcomings, though, are a function of the laws governing it. They can impose fines and refer cases for prosecution, but after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Ohio’s false statement statutes, a substantial chunk of the commission’s job went away.
Referring to that case, Stewart said lawmakers never “right sized the operation in response.” As the House’s chief budget negotiator, he pushed to abolish the OEC and transfer its duties to the new Election Integrity Unit with the Secretary of State.
Ohio House budget would eliminate independent campaign finance oversight

Instead of the Ohio Elections Commission, the budget directs the secretary to set up a new Ohio Election Integrity Commission. That unit will investigate campaign finance complaints as well as election law violations like improper registration. It will have five members instead of the current seven, and at least three of the five must be attorneys. Commissioners will be chosen by the secretary and legislative leaders of both parties.
That’s a departure from the current structure where the governor names three Republican and three Democratic members who in turn select a seventh independent member. In all likelihood, the new arrangement will set up the secretary’s designee as the tie-breaking vote. In cases of a potential conflict of interest, the attorney general is meant designate someone else to investigate a complaint.
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Sec. LaRose for this story, but his office did not respond.
How do we get there?
At the close of the most recent OEC hearing, commissioners took a moment to discuss what it will look like to wind down their operation. Commissioner Ernie Knight cut to chase.
“So, for me, the most important part, first and foremost, for the next meeting is to understand at a very granular level, if we have enough capital to get through the end of the year,” he said.
In an interview, Executive Director Phil Richter wasn’t particularly optimistic about funding lasting until the handoff.
“Depending on how you mean, ‘get through the rest of the year,’ not necessarily, no,” he said.
The problem is the funding typically appropriated to the commission lands in April or May in an ordinary budget cycle. That’s obviously too late if they’re handing things off at the beginning of January. Richter said they’re still working through the figures, and if it looks like they’ll fall short, “that would be worked out between me, my budget analyst, (the Office of Budget and Management) and the Controlling Board.”

In the next couple of weeks Richter is going to tell county boards to pause new referrals. He wants the commission to clear as much of its docket as possible before handing things over. Right now, they’ve got roughly 150 cases.
“Of the about 150, I feel like we’ll get through most of those,” Richter explained.
But beyond abstract questions about funding or the transferring of cases, there’s the very tangible question of what to do with the office. What happens with the cabinets full of paper files? Or the desks? Or the staff?
“Great question,” Richter said with a grin. “There isn’t an answer right now — let’s put it that way.”
The budget carries a provision transferring existing staff to the secretary, and Richter is hopeful they’ll be kept on. He’d already been contemplating retirement and said he expects to finish the year and move on, although he left the door open to “other opportunities.”
As for the files and furniture, Richter has had preliminary conversations with the secretary’s staff but that’s about it.
“I don’t know that they want all this stuff,” he said. “but all this stuff at one level becomes their stuff.”
“It could be it all just gets taken and put out to storage, out on Surface Road, and put into the next auction,” he added.

Mike DeWine wants to get rid of proposition bets after two Cleveland Guardians players were placed on leave for gambling allegations. 
DeWine is calling on the Ohio Casino Control Commission to remove prop bets from the type of bets that can be placed in Ohio. 
A prop bet is a wager on an individual player or a specific event in a game, rather than the final outcome of the game. The number of strikeouts a pitcher throws or if a player hits a home run are examples of prop bets.

“The evidence that prop betting is harming athletics in Ohio is reaching critical mass,” DeWine said in a news release. “The harm to athletes and the integrity of the game is clear, and the benefits are not worth the harm. The prop betting experiment in this country has failed badly.” 
DeWine is calling on the commissioners and players unions of Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the Women’s National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer to support the ban on prop betting. 
Ohio does not allow bettors to place prop bets on college athletes. Instead, Ohio bettors are able to make bets on the overall outcome and final score of college sporting events. This happened after NCAA President Charlie Baker wrote a letter to the OCCC asking for the change in 2024. 
Prior to Baker’s letter, DeWine had spoken out against threats made against University of Dayton basketball players shortly after Ohio launched legalized sports gambling in 2023. 
“The Ohio Casino Control Commission took quick action to protect student athletes from unnecessary and potentially harmful threats,” DeWine said back in 2024. “Amending rules to focus bets on the team and away from individual athletes will improve the marketplace in Ohio and properly focus betting attention on the teams and away from individual student athletes.”
MLB placed Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz on non-disciplinary paid leave on July 3 to look into gambling charges against him during Guardians games in June. About two weeks later, MLB extended Ortiz’s leave of absence through Aug. 31. 
On July 28, MLB also placed Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase on non-disciplinary paid leave through Aug. 31 as part of a related sports betting investigation.

Laura Kelly speaks at a rally on May 29, 2025, in Topeka. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Amid all the ominous signs for the unraveling of our constitutional republic — and the 50 state governments contained therein — one last month struck me as particularly bleak.
The Atlantic first reported that Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be leaving the National Governors Association. The bipartisan group claims that it serves as “the voice of the nation’s Governors and a leading forum for bipartisan policy solutions.” Democrats Kelly and Walz apparently didn’t see it that way.
Meanwhile, Kelly has raised her national profile as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association and has called for a robust response to potential gerrymandering in Texas.
The cliche response to this storm of news would be: “I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore.” But we are in Kansas, and in every other state besides. The notion that officials might benefit from listening to one another and working together has been thrown on the partisan bonfire. As Republicans attempt to extract maximum advantage from government, Democrats find themselves forced to react in kind.
None of this reflects reality. According to Pew, the United States splits right down the middle between Republican and Democrat party registration. There’s a similar division between governors, with 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats. But what does the real word have to do with politics?
Apparently Democratic governors have grouched about the national group for some time.
Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker of the Atlantic wrote July 24 that “some Democratic members of the group have privately been fuming in recent months over the organization’s tepid reaction to President Donald Trump’s federal incursions into state matters. They complain that the group did not respond forcefully enough when Trump’s Office of Management and Budget briefly ordered a disruptive pause on the disbursement of all federal funds in January; when Maine Governor Janet Mills and her staff clashed with the White House the following month, over transgender sports; and in June, when Trump deployed the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles over the objections of local authorities.”
That makes sense. But what an unfortunate situation for governance in this country. What an unfortunate lack of spine as the federal government spirals.
Kelly decided not to privately fume any longer, making her unhappiness public. Remember, we’re not talking about a stereotypical wild-eyed leftist here. We’re talking about Laura Kelly, a politician whose primary skill has always been demonstrating her sanity in an otherwise insane world of political maneuvering.
“I just felt like Kansas was not getting a return on investment, and we will keep our eyes on it,” Kelly said, according to KSNT. Dues for the organization run about $100,000 a year. “The NGA does some very good things particularly in the area of training for governor’s staff, but there also needs to be a state rights advocate, and I think they’ve sort of fallen down on that role.”
In the meantime, political tensions have flared over mid-decade redistricting for congressional seats. Lawmakers usually draw maps every decade, following U.S. Census results. However, Texas legislators have been pressed by Trump to create new maps earlier, making it more difficult for Democrats to win U.S. House seats. Given that the governing party usually loses seats in midterm elections, this redistricting could cushion the expected blow for Republicans.
This has enraged Democrats, and leaders of blue states like California have threatened their own gerrymanders in retaliation. Guess who’s OK with that? Laura Kelly.
“I have never believed in unilateral disarmament, and so while I may not want to participate in certain activities, if I have to, in order to level the playing field, I would support my Democratic colleagues who decide to answer in kind,” she told ABC News at a policy retreat last week.
She added: “If the other side is going to pursue this, regardless of the obvious unconstitutionality of it, then I don’t think we have any other choice but to go there. You just don’t go to the front lines without your bullets.”
By running and governing as authoritarian wanna-bes, Republicans have pushed moderate Democrats like Kelly toward bare-knuckle political combat. They have alienated would-be allies, all in the service of the dime-store strongman living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We live in a narrowly divided country, but the GOP has chosen to eschew rules, norms or the barest sense of shame.
Kelly will do fine. I wish I could say the same for our state and nation.

Despite the strength of the U.S. economy, the gap between rich and poor Americans is increasing.
The wealthiest 1% of Americans have more than five times as much wealth as the bottom 50%, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. That’s up from four times as much in the year 2000. In 2024 alone, the wealthiest 19 families got a total of $1 trillion richer – the largest one-year increase on record.
And yet 59% of Americans don’t have enough money saved up to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense.
We are political scientists who study human rights and political economy.
In a 2023 study, our team looked at 145 countries, including the U.S., to understand the link between labor rights and inequality. We found evidence that strengthening collective labor rights may reduce economic inequality.
 Empowering workers

Collective labor rights include the rights to form and join a union, bargain collectively for higher pay and better working conditions, go on strike, and get justice if employers punish workers who exercise these rights.
In the U.S., where less than 10% of workers belong to unions, union members typically earn higher wages than their nonunion counterparts.
Through negotiations on behalf of their members, unions can pressure employers to provide fair wages and benefits. If negotiations break down, the union can call for a strike – sometimes winning better benefits and higher wages as a result.
Some U.S. unions don’t have the right to strike, including air traffic controllers, teachers and those working on national security issues. But most unions have some ability to implement work stoppages and impose costs on employers to negotiate for raises and better benefits and conditions.
 Reducing inequality

For our study, we analyzed the human rights in the CIRIGHTS dataset, which uses human rights reports from the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International and other sources to measure government respect for 24 human rights, including the rights to unionize and bargain collectively. The dataset is produced by the University of Rhode Island, Binghamton University and the University of Connecticut. One of us, Skip Mark, serves as a co-director of the project.
Using a scoring guide, a team of researchers reads human rights reports and gives each country a score of zero if they have widespread violations, one point if they have some violations, or two if they have no evidence of violations. The team has assigned scores for all 24 rights from 1994 through 2022.
Using this data, we created a measure of collective labor rights by adding scores for the right to workplace association and the right to collective bargaining. The resulting collective labor rights score ranges from zero to four.
Countries where workers’ rights are routinely violated, such as Afghanistan, China and Saudi Arabia, scored a zero. The United States, Macedonia and Zambia, three countries with little in common, were among those that tended to get two points, placing them in the middle. Countries with no reported violations of the rights to workplace association and collective bargaining, including Canada, Sweden and France, got four points.
According to the CIRIGHTS dataset, the strength of respect for collective labor rights around the world declined by 50%, from 2.06 in 1994 to 1.03 in 2022.
At the same time, according to the World Inequality Dataset, the share of income earned by the 1% with the biggest paychecks increased by 11%.
We used advanced statistical methods to figure out whether better worker protections actually reduce inequality or are just associated with it.
 Gaps between individuals and ethnic groups

We also measured what’s been happening to economic inequality, using two common ways to track it.
One of them is vertical inequality, the gap between what people earn within a country – the rich versus the poor. The more unequal a society becomes, the higher its vertical inequality score gets. We measured it using the disposable income measure from the Gini index, a commonly used indicator of economic inequality that captures how much money individuals have to spend after taxes and government transfers.
We found that a one-point increase in collective labor rights on our four-point scale reduces vertical inequality by 10 times the average change in inequality. For the U.S., a one-point increase in collective labor rights would be about enough to undo the increase in inequality that occurred between 2008 and 2010 due to the Great Recession and its aftermath. It would also likely help stem the growing wealth gap between Black and white Americans. That’s because income disparities compound over time to create wealth gaps.
We also assessed the connection between horizontal inequality, which measures income inequality between ethnic or other groups, and collective labor rights.
Negative horizontal inequality measures the amount of a country’s income held by the poorest ethnic group. Higher scores for this metric indicate that the lowest-earning ethnic group has less income relative to the rest of society. Black Americans have the lowest median income of any racial or ethnic group, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Positive horizontal inequality measures the income earned by the richest ethnic group. When positive horizontal inequality rises, that means the richest ethnic group has more income relative to the rest of society. According to the same Census Bureau report, Asian Americans had the highest median earnings.
We found that stronger collective labor rights, both in law and in practice around the world, also reduce both types of horizontal inequality. This means they raise the floor by helping to improve the income of the poorest ethnic groups in society. They also close the gap by limiting the incomes of the richest ethnic group, which can reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
That is, our findings suggest that when workers are free to advocate for higher wages and better benefits for themselves, it also benefits society as a whole.

Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.










It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, professor of sports marketing at Clemson University


After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

(Mac Johnson/Nebraska News Service)Nebraska legislators spent much of their recent session debating and parsing the political landscape in two primary areas: the will of the people via the ballot box and the ongoing culture wars, those nitpicky, divisive punch ups, which often cleave communities. 
That focus last session was the subject of an excellent article by Nebraska Examiner reporter Juan Salinas II.
While he meticulously detailed the body’s battles over issues ranging from taxes to school books to whether your cheeseburger came from a petri dish or a pasture, most troubling was the inordinate amount of time senators spent on what can only be described as undoing the will of the people. 
By the end, the majority had watered down, thinned or undermined initiatives already approved by voters regarding paid sick leave, medical cannabis and minimum wage requirements, the latter, while not passing muster this past session, is sure to be debated again next year. 
Governing by ballot initiative is a tedious, meandering process, often exacerbated by lengthy campaigns to gather petition signatures and court filings disputing everything from language to intent. Nevertheless, that’s our way of doing things. 
Yes, democracy isn’t easy. Nor is it quick.
Ergo, I understand and respect — sometimes grudgingly — that once the votes have been counted, game over. For example, after railing in a number of commentaries about how a lie led to a petition that resulted in Nebraska now requiring photo IDs to vote, I dutifully had my driver’s license at the ready to mark my X when the time came. 
True, the Legislature is charged with putting flesh on the bones of passed initiatives. But weakening them in any way truly is at odds with the people’s will. In our system, “Put it to a vote” both poses the question and has the expectation that we follow the answer … even when we vehemently disagree with the result because we have other remedies. (See your local civics class for details. Wait, do we still teach that?)
Politics is the mechanism by which we practice these principles of democracy. At its core is the art of creating and selling an idea, one that the majority of those affected believe will better their or their neighbors’ lives. We call voting our civic duty, though usually a third to half who have the right don’t use it. Even so, having the decision subverted or enfeebled by another elected body should be a non-starter in a democratic republic.
That said, if an initiative that passes turns out to be a real stinker or constitutionally challenged, the separation of powers can reign in or block such nonsense going forward. Legislators know that and should act accordingly. 
Ballot initiatives as a political solution have become popular. Paid petition circulators and expensive PR campaigns routinely accompany such efforts. Legislators should expect to continue to deal with them while never minimizing the power and voice of a vote of the people nor alter the initiative’s focus.
I hesitate to talk about the culture wars for a number of reasons, not least of which is that I too often seem to write about the horrors and hijinks of too many who don’t like how others chose to live, love, pray, eat, read … the list could go on. 
The Legislature last session joined the fray debating transgender issues and sports, lab grown meat, what books kids can read in school, and, most curious, that Nebraska public schools should only be deemed full and functioning if they posted the Ten Commandments in every classroom. The proposal never made it out of committee. Thank God.
I’m often hard-pressed to see what problems are solved by shaking down colleges and universities for being “woke.” Or banning books not simply because you don’t want your child to read them, but because you don’t want anyone’s child to read them. Or continually obsessing about transgender youth, which, in practice and new laws, effectively questions their actual being — who they are. 
While issues such as trans athletes’ participation in scholastic sports are up for debate, it seems that much of what has transpired in legislative chambers, political debates and coffee shops about trans kids specifically and the LGBTQ+ community generally could have been avoided by simply minding our own business.
But what do I know? White hot culture war arguments still erupt on social media and nearly 600 pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation were proposed in state legislatures in 2025. Go figure. 
Here’s the most critical point of the culture wars: What are the spoils for winning?

Al Capone liked to relax in Miami Beach.
Ex-dictators, junta leaders, and death squad commanders from Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, Honduras, Venezuela, and Panama have moved here when things got too hot at home.
Then there are the dodgy New York billionaires, including the felonious current occupant of the White House and his erstwhile pal, the late Jeffrey Epstein, who installed themselves in ocean-front mansions and became Florida Men.
Epstein’s girlfriend/posh pimp Ghislaine Maxwell made herself a Florida Woman, too, shopping for young girls in Palm Beach County.
Then she moved north, although not by choice: She was sentenced to 20 years for sex trafficking and imprisoned at FCI Tallahassee.
Now the feds have whisked her off to some tennis prison in Texas.
If you’re a halfway rational human being, you probably haven’t given much thought to her over the past six months, what with the attacks on science, the attempts to wreck higher education, the dismantling of environmental protections, and destruction of the rule of law.
 Obsession
Our brothers and sisters in MAGA, however, just can’t get her out of their heads.
They’re fixated on her, Jeffrey Epstein, and these alleged files which may or may not still be sitting on the attorney general’s desk.
They’re convinced the files contain mighty secrets about nefarious cabals, Pizzagate, Lizard People, and sex island dirt on the Clintons.
Pam Bondi claimed on Fox “News” she would “review” the files then put Epstein’s stuff out there for everyone’s delectation.
Yet no files have been forthcoming, and boy, is MAGA mad.
Recently some “personal finance” website voted Tallahassee the ninth most boring city in America.
Unfair!
Until last Friday when Maxwell left us, everybody wanted to visit Tallahassee.
Florida’s capital was the focus of the political world, an object of slathering fascination especially among podcast hosts, news junkies, cable TV reporters, Never Trumpers, Ride-or-Die Trumpers, and people on psychotropic medication.
Call that boring? We hadn’t gotten this much attention since the Great Presidential Vote Count Screw-Up of 2000.
Trump acolyte Todd Blanche (his side-hustle is being Bondi’s deputy AG) recently descended upon the United States Courthouse in downtown Tallahassee to interview Maxwell in the presence of her Miami attorney David Markus.
 Look over there!
Blanche and Markus admit they are good friends but swear there’s no conflict of interest, no sir, nothing to see here.
We don’t know what they said, but Ghislaine-o-mania isn’t going away.
Hoping to distract us, the regime keeps hollering “Squirrel!”
The FBI just released 230,000 files on the assassination of Martin Luther King.
National Security Tsarina Tulsi Gabbard has accused Barack Obama of treason, claiming he cooked up a coup against Trump in the 2016 election.
Speaker Mike Johnson was all for releasing the Epstein files until he wasn’t (maybe there was a phone call from the Oval Office?), so he adjourned the House early to avoid a vote on it.
Trump himself has been slinging delusions around like a chimp with a barrel of feces, claiming the Epstein files were created by James Comey or Joe Biden or maybe sinister Greenlandic elves.
When that didn’t seem to work, he started barking about changing the names of NFL teams in Cincinnati and Washington back to “Indians” and “Redskins.”
Then he tried to change the subject by flouncing off to Scotland (where three-quarters of the population heartily despise him) to (in order of importance) 1. Play golf; 2. Make a “trade deal” with the EU that will cleverly raise costs for Americans.
The Scots and the international press made sure nobody forgot how the president and Florida’s favorite pedophile used to be bosom buddies, dogging him with questions and snark.
There’s a grand sign at the entrance to his Aberdeenshire golf course proclaiming “Trump International Golf Links.” Underneath, somebody placed a smaller, quite official-looking sign which said, “Twinned with Epstein Island.”
 Overboard
Neither heat domes nor killer floods nor ICE agents nor gloom of night will stay Americans from their fixation with Epstein and Maxwell.
And so — inevitably — back to Florida, always the humid center of bad behavior, back to Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach palace of horrors, and back to Ghislaine Maxwell, surely the most uptown inmate in FCI history.
She was once an heiress, the youngest child of megabucks London newspaper baron Robert Maxwell. As a student at Oxford, she was described as a “shiny glamazon.”
But her father was not only physically and emotionally abusive, he was embezzling from his own company and defrauding its employees.
In 1991, they found Robert Maxwell face down in the sea.
He’d been sailing near the Canary Islands on his yacht “The Lady Ghislaine.” Nobody ever figured out whether he jumped or was pushed.
Next thing you know, Ghislaine is Jeffrey Epstein’s arm candy, hard at work procuring young girls for him.
Like Trump, Epstein was a New Yorker trying to be a big deal in Palm Beach. In 1990 he bought a 14,000 square foot mansion and partied at Mar-a-Lago.
Like Trump, noisome stories about sexual abuse swirled around him like a nasty cocktail of skunk spray and dog poop.
 Enabling Epstein
You will not be surprised to learn that the state of Florida played a major role in enabling Epstein.
Having amassed vast evidence he’d raped and sexually assaulted at least a dozen under-age girls, Palm Beach County cops searched his Palm Beach mansion in 2005, only to find his six computer hard drives had disappeared.
Epstein finally got arrested, and though a federal grand jury returned a 60-count indictment, he was allowed to plead guilty only to “soliciting a prostitute.”
In 2008, he was put into the private wing of the Palm Beach County jail. He had his own television room. His personal driver arrived every morning to take him to his office.
Turns out the Palm Beach County state attorney, the FBI, prosecutors and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida — a man named Alex Acosta, later appointed Secretary of Labor by Donald Trump — colluded to give Epstein the sweetest of sweet deals: a 20-month sentence.
He served about a year.
This is corrupt even by Florida standards.
When he got out in 2009, Epstein went back to living the lifestyle of the rich and infamous while the young women he assaulted and exploited were forgotten.
We might never have known all this were it not for the relentless and brilliant work of journalist Julie Brown, whose 2018 series in the Miami Herald gave voice to his victims: She tracked down more than five dozen of them.
 ‘Pyramid scheme’
Brown’s reporting detailed how he’d prey on homeless girls or especially vulnerable kids, paying them to bring in other girls.
This sex-trafficking “pyramid scheme,” as Brown calls it, was run by Ghislaine Maxwell.
Maxwell would visit South Florida gyms and spas, telling petite blonde high schoolers — apparently Epstein’s “type” — they could make big money giving massages to “this old guy.”
She encountered 17-year old Virginia Giuffre working at Mar-a-Lago’s spa and convinced her to “work” for Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre said Epstein passed her around to various men, including Prince Andrew and prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz, instructing her to have sex with them. Prince Andrew denied the allegations but he wound up reaching a settlement with Giuffre. Dershowitz has also repeatedly denied allegations. Giuffre dropped her allegations against Dershowitz in 2022 and said she “may have made a mistake.”
Trump claims he had no idea what his good friend Jeffrey was up to back then, variously insisting he ditched Epstein for being “sleazy” (insert your own pot-and-kettle joke here) or they quarreled over Epstein’s “stealing” his pretty young Mar-a-Lago employees.
Brown’s attention to the shady nonprosecution deal in Palm Beach eventually led to his 2019 New York arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.
Epstein, of course, is now dead, most likely by suicide — though lots of MAGAs don’t believe that.
Virginia Giuffre is also dead, definitely by suicide.
Ghislaine Maxwell, however, is still here.
She wasn’t exactly living her best life in Tallahassee, spending her days giving yoga classes, teaching etiquette (even criminals want to be ladylike!) and, no doubt, explaining over and over that her name is not pronounced “Gizz-Lane.”
MAGA (and quite a few Democrats) want her to talk; she wants out of prison.
She may be about to get lucky.
 Pardon
Thanks to Trumpists’ rich fantasy life, in which everything is a conspiracy of the Deep Swamp, she suddenly has some power.
She says she’ll testify in public as long as Congress agrees to a few little provisions as spelled out by her lawyer, chiefly immunity and a chance to see the committee’s questions in advance.
She also doesn’t want to appear before them until after the Supreme Court hears her appeal, in which she makes the thoroughly bizarre argument that the nonprosecution deal the Southern District of Florida cut with Epstein should apply to her, too.
Classic Florida move: The rules are different here.
Anyway, if they don’t comply, she’ll take the Fifth.
Trump keeps saying he’s “allowed” to pardon her, though he evades the question of whether he actually would.
That, no doubt, depends on what kind of dirt he thinks she has on him and whether that outweighs dirt she might have on his perceived enemies.
Here in Tallahassee, we’re feeling a little sore, a little mad at Texas for stealing our celebrity sex offender.
But once a Florida Woman, always a Florida Woman.
Texas will never take that away from us.

This bill prevents that.,"Spare me the fake outrage about Senate Bill 1370. Claims like those made in “No kings? CT Democrats might want to look in the mirror” wrongly cast doubt on legislation that creates quality jobs for Connecticut’s working families.
Let’s be clear: SB 1370 didn’t create a loophole, it closed one. For years companies have dodged fair wage standards by shifting construction work to nearby “off-site” locations. Working families were getting hung to dry because of a stupid technicality. 
With SB 1370, common-sense finally prevails. Skilled workers will get paid fairly, and public dollars will support quality local jobs. This bill went through a transparent, public process, with a hearing, a committee vote and broad support that earned its place in the budget. Our lawmakers and the governor were absolutely right to get it done.

Vital health coverage and food assistance programs are being slashed to fund massive tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. A mass deportation agenda is infused with hundreds of billions of dollars. The LGBTQ+ community is under heightened threat.  A provision to immediately “defund” Planned Parenthood from the federal Medicaid program makes access to reproductive healthcare more precarious than ever.
The rollback of rights and resources is not hypothetical. These are deliberate choices, with devastating consequences for people in every corner of our state.
That’s why, months ago, Protect CT, a coalition of 11 statewide advocacy and service organizations, came together to sound the alarm and share a roadmap for resilience and safety. Now, with the recently signed-into-law One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the harm is no longer looming; it’s landing.
Connecticut took some important steps this past legislative session that go beyond incremental, and that will help advance progress. We celebrate efforts to invest in early childhood and K-12 education, and acknowledge the thoughtful planning to set aside funds for an economic recession. These are good examples of why we love Connecticut and what will continue to make our state a great one. This is also a testament to decades-long community advocacy and political will—doing what’s right even when it’s hard. 
However, Connecticut’s response has been uneven at best. 
While modest funding increases were made to Medicaid and the EITC for families, and marginal improvements were made to the state’s Trust Act, these investments and policy changes fell short of what’s needed. In fact, in a troubling unwillingness to address certain issues, the Gov. Ned Lamont threatened to veto important bills and concepts had they gone to a vote in the regular session. What’s more, the Governor vetoed the primary housing bill of the session. 
There has been talk of a potential special session to respond to the federal reconciliation bill. While this is an important next step, if our elected leaders are serious about protecting Connecticut, we cannot afford to remain reactive. A special session should address federal funding gaps as well as the various crises (like housing) that have been and continue to be felt by residents across our state. The only way forward in Connecticut is to proactively pass and enact ambitious policies that will allow Connecticut to rise and meet this moment.
We have a plan to make that happen.  
The federal landscape has changed. We are living through unprecedented times unlike anything we’ve seen in a generation. And, in spite of this, the partners of Protect CT still believe in what’s possible. We believe in the values the people of this state hold: fairness, justice, and opportunity for all. But belief is not enough. We need bold action. 
So, to every state leader who failed to vote for immigrant protections: these people are important members of our community and our economy – we must stand by them. 
To those who support reproductive freedom and transgender rights, now is the time to take bold action that protects access to vital health care for those who need it today and for years to come.
When you call for affordability for families but haven’t yet passed a state-level child tax credit: now is the time to provide meaningful support to families to help manage the high cost of living.
And to those who say now is not the time for bold action: If not now, when?
The next legislative session cannot be business as usual because these are not normal times. The stakes are too high. We will continue to fight for a future where our residents are safe, supported, and free, no matter what zip code they live in, how much money they make, or where they were born. But we can’t do it alone. 
We call on state leaders to act boldly and urgently: to protect immigrants, safeguard access to the full spectrum of healthcare, and pass a child tax credit. If you’re ready to fight with us for a better Connecticut, join us:  Call your legislators and Governor Lamont today and ask them to move forward with these measures to protect Connecticut and move us forward.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York began offering free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons on Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so.
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)
A group of state attorneys general, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of mounting an unconstitutional pressure campaign against gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges actions taken by the Justice Department to investigate and halt gender-affirming care across the country.
The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict gender-affirming care at the federal level through threats of criminal and civil penalties, while skirting state laws that protect transgender patients’ health care.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

As federal investigations and funding threats roll out, hospitals across the country are shutting down their gender-affirming care programs for minors — including in areas where access to this care is protected by state law. Clinics and medical programs have shuttered in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois and Washington, D.C., among others — despite state laws that protect the care’s legality. Multiple hospitals have attributed shuttering or pausing their gender-affirming care programs to President Donald Trump’s executive orders and federal administrative actions, including the Yale health system and Denver Health in Colorado.

The White House recently celebrated these closures as a direct result of Trump’s executive orders.
“The administration’s actions put providers in an impossible position: either comply with unlawful federal threats or violate state laws that require nondiscriminatory access to medical care,” New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office said in a statement.
James and other attorneys general suing the Trump administration argue that these actions are not based in law, since no federal statute prohibits gender-affirming care in the United States. Instead, these actions are an intimidation tactic to suppress the health care, the lawsuit alleges. Through the courts, they are attempting to halt the Justice Department’s actions.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the attorneys general of states where gender clinics have recently shuttered, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. They assert that gender-affirming care is legally protected in all of their states and that federal efforts to block that care violate states’ rights provided by the 10th Amendment.
Over the past few months, federal agencies have begun to follow through on Trump’s executive orders regarding gender-affirming care.
In early July, Chad Mizelle, chief of staff at the Justice Department, announced that the agency had launched at least 20 subpoenas into clinics involved in gender transition care, alongside subpoenas to drug manufacturers and investigations into hospitals providing the care. Doctors are being subpoenaed for patients’ private information, the New York Times reports. The agency is following the White House directive it received in January, via executive order, to broadly investigate gender-affirming care. In these directives, the Trump administration has incorrectly conflated the care with female genital mutilation.
The New York lawsuit challenges these actions, as well as FBI criminal investigations into three children’s hospitals that currently provide gender-affirming care or have done so in the past. Although the lawsuit is being brought against Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, it also references other actions taken by federal agencies targeting gender-affirming care — including an all-day event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission. That event, titled “the dangers of ‘gender-affirming care’ for minors,” is where the Justice Department first announced its subpoenas for confidential patient information.
Major medical groups including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The new president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which sets global standards for doctors and nurses providing health care to trans patients, has expressed concerns that banning gender-affirming care will simply drive the care underground and endanger patients.
Transgender people, as well as the families and parents of transgender youth, are feeling increasingly worried and scared as the Trump administration targets their identities and their health care. For years, states have banned gender-affirming care for minors in red states and through Republican-controlled legislatures; but now, with the crackdown taking place on a national level, trans people living in blue states and liberal cities face the same threat.

[…]","A protester being escorted out of the ballroom at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel in Orlando on August 2, 2025 (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)ORLANDO – The Republican Party of Florida has never been more powerful than right now.
It has controlled the governor’s mansion for nearly three decades – and also currently holds all three Cabinet offices, maintains a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and maintains a more than 1.3 million voter registration lead over Democrats.
Yet several top-leading GOP leaders at the Florida Freedom Forum in Orlando on Saturday warned that complacency and infighting could give an opening to their political rivals.
“Don’t get high on your own supply,” said Gov. Ron DeSantis. “There is nothing permanent in politics.”
For proof, both the governor and his close ideological ally, newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, referenced two proposed constitutional amendments on last year’s statewide ballot that nearly passed.
Amendment 3 would have legalized adult recreational cannabis, while Amendment 4 would have enshrined abortion rights into the state’s Constitution. Both received more than 55% support, a clear majority but not enough to break the 60% threshold required for passage.
“If the left can spend $250 million running these ballot initiatives, they can turn this into California through the backdoor,” DeSantis said. “Without ever having to control the Legislature. Without even ever being able to elect a governor, again, and we could wake up in 10 years and all of a sudden, we’ve got a left-wing state. And so Amendments 3 and 4 were really a big test for this state.”

“Never, ever underestimate leftists and their ability to lie, cheat and steal,” added Ingoglia. “Leftist and progressives know they can’t win in Florida as candidates anymore. So now they’re trying to buy our Constitution in an effort to turn this state into California. Massive voter fraud. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent. Vague language. Enticing titles. Foreign money. Last year’s amendments should be a wake-up call for every God-fearing Republican in this room … they’re not going to let up, and neither should we. Guard our Constitution!”
Left unsaid was the fact that in reaction to those proposals, the Legislature passed and DeSantis signed into law a measure that Democrats say has made it significantly more difficult to pass (or even get on the ballot) citizen-led constitutional amendments in the future. The criticisms over Amendment 3 are also notable because the measure was backed by President Donald Trump and state Sen. Joe Gruters, who Trump is now backing to become chair of the Republican National Committee.
So it could be seen as notable that Byron Donalds, the Naples-based Republican U.S. Rep. who President Trump endorsed in the 2026 gubernatorial race, said the only thing that could shut down the GOP’s momentum in Florida is intraparty fighting.
“Listen man, we cannot fight among ourselves in this moment,” he told conservative influencer Benny Johnson in a conversation. “The wind is at our back. 1.3, 1.4 million voter advantage in the state of Florida. We are winning. And the only way you stop winning is when we start fighting each other, because this person wants to be in charge. That person wants to be in charge. Or I want my committee. ..we need to stay united and we need to keep winning.”
Donalds has already won the backing of Trump for governor, but DeSantis has declined to endorse him so far.
Other officials who spoke at the event —which also included an award handed to Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff who has been at odds in the past with DeSantis — included Attorney General James Uthemier, who like Ingoglia, was appointed to his position by DeSantis earlier this year (in his case to replace Ashley Moody).
While relatively unknown except in Florida political circles before his appointment, Uthmeier has been in the news frequently this summer, warning local officials they could be removed from office if they don’t get with the DeSantis agenda on illegal immigration.
Uthmeier took a victory lap of sorts telling the audience how he had come up with the notion of the detention facility in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
And he accused state Democrats who recently paid a visit to the site as “political grandstanding” and said they cared more about the undocumented than American families who have suffered from the open border policies under former President Joe Biden. “Which is why their party is getting their butt kicked every single day,” he said.
Uthemier also reminded the crowd of Republicans that he will be on the ballot next year.
“If you want somebody who’s soft on crime, that’s lenient, that wants illegal immigrants to get an easy way out, I am absolutely not your guy,” he said.
 A day of protests

Uthmeier also had to deal with a protester who began shouting at him early in his presentation, one of more than half-a-dozen such outbursts that took place throughout the day at the Rosen Shingle Creek hotel.
  One of several protesters who were ejected from the ballroom at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel in Orlando on August 2, 2025 (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)
“Get this guy outta here,” he shouted. “You know what? I think we’ve got a spot in Alligator Alcatraz for that guy.”
Nobody was interrupted more than DeSantis.
“You’ve got to do a better job than that if you’re going to interrupt,” he proclaimed after a fourth protestor began shouting out during his speech. The protestor was escorted out of the ballroom and DeSantis offered: “That was a weak performance.”
Two other protesters also were escorted out earlier in the morning after shouting at U.S. Rep. Randy Fine, who was in conversation with fellow Republican congressional members congress Daniel Webster and Aaron Bean.
The group of activists issued a press release later in the day explaining their actions.
“Republican lawmakers have made it difficult to register complaints,” read a portion of the statement.  “They’ve dodged town halls, ignored petitions, ducked our phone calls, and generally done everything they can to avoid hearing from any constituents who don’t already agree with them.”
Joy Metzler, who wore a “Veterans against Fascism” T-shirt and described herself in the press release as a “recently separated Air Force Veteran,” blasted Florida Republicans for helping to construct the immigration detention center, saying they had “built a concentration camp in our own backyard, a stunningly disrespectful insult to my grandfather, who fought against the Nazis in WWII.”
The intermittent outbursts were mostly treated as annoying distractions in a day otherwise set aside for a celebration of GOP dominance in the state.

(South Dakota Searchlight images)There is early, bipartisan interest in serving as the next governor of South Dakota.
Republicans already have three announced candidates for the primary in 2026, with one more likely contestant waiting in the wings. Democrats have signed up a 19-year-old college student with hints that an adult or two may also seek that party’s nomination.
So much early interest in the job is baffling because being governor of South Dakota is a task that is getting tougher by the day. So far, the U.S. House and Senate have acquiesced to the Trump administration’s attempts to cancel federal funding that has already been approved by Congress. Those actions will mean profound changes for state budgets.
19-year-old at the top of the ticket is no way to build a party

The irony is that the Republican candidates applying for such a tough job have all, to some degree, offered their loyalty to Donald Trump. According to a South Dakota Searchlight story, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden has already spent $187,000 to build his name recognition in the state. In his commercials and mailings, the name that often appears next to Doeden’s is Trump’s.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson doesn’t have to run ads claiming loyalty to Trump as he has been in Washington, D.C., doing the president’s bidding. Johnson voted for a “big, beautiful bill” that is estimated to add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. He also gave his approval to the president’s plan to claw back money that had been allocated for South Dakota Public Broadcasting, financially hamstringing a state institution.
Not much is heard yet from state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen who doesn’t have Doeden’s money or Johnson’s name recognition. Since Hansen is from the same MAGA/“patriot” wing of the state Republican Party as Doeden, it’s unlikely he would break with Trump on any issue. Undeclared as a candidate so far is Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has had nothing but praise for the president.
Yet, as Trump and his minions continue to take a machete to the federal budget, he only serves to make life tougher for the next governor of South Dakota.
An easy reference for this can be found on South Dakota Searchlight’s “Federal Fallout” page, containing stories detailing the impact of federal budget cuts in this state. A scroll through the stories shows some of the challenges that the next governor will face as federal funding starts to disappear:

$5 million of extra costs for the state to manage the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
$2.2 million cut from South Dakota Public Broadcasting.
$5.6 million cut from efforts to expand digital access.
$2.8 million for teacher training.

Remember, in South Dakota, a million dollars still goes a long way. Consequently, replacing a million dollars in the state budget will be hard work. The state budget is $7.3 billion. Of that, $3.1 billion comes from the federal government.


Federal Fallout
South Dakota impacts from federal funding cuts and policy changes.
Read the latest > 


Ultimately, there’s no telling how much the federal government’s share of the state budget will shrink. Cutting foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting were just the first of Trump’s rescission efforts to erase federal spending that has already been approved by Congress.
All of this is happening at a time when South Dakotans are upset about the continual rise in property taxes. The next governor will be faced with the task of figuring out how to moderate or cut those taxes while also finding a way to replace federal funds that have gone missing.
Some of these federal cuts will be felt in the next session of the Legislature. A South Dakota Searchlight story about a meeting of state fiscal experts included a projection that lagging revenue could result in as much as $24.5 million less for the next state budget.
These candidates who want to be governor should pay close attention to the funding problems faced by Gov. Rhoden and legislators in the next session. There is still plenty of time between now and January for Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress to make more cuts. The struggles in Pierre will serve as a harbinger of the challenges the next governor will face.
Fear of Trump’s wrath sparks an almost blind loyalty within the Republican Party. These GOP candidates for governor must ask themselves if they really want the job of running South Dakota government while the party leader they praise is working overtime to make the job more difficult.

The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.


– Justin Mcelwain, Pittsburg, Kan., resident


Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
‘Not a bumper sticker bill’
The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
Democrats ‘fight back’
This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

In both of his terms in office, Donald Trump has taken aim at each of the principal ways that people from other countries can become naturalized United States citizens
The post A nation of immigrants imperiled  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AT THE RECENT graduation ceremony for Northern Essex Community College’s Center for Adult Education, we celebrated the accomplishments of 24 students who had completed their high school equivalency exams, dozens more who finished English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs, 15 inductees into the National Adult Education Honor Society, and six newly naturalized citizens of the United States, who, waving American flags, treated the crowd to a surprise performance of “God Bless America.” 
Adult education programs like these are offered by community colleges, school districts, and non-profit organizations across the country, and are in high demand by people seeking a second chance at improving their lives through education; by employers looking for talented, credentialed workers in a tight labor market; and by immigrants drawn to the promise of America. 
Recently, these programs seemed to be at risk, as the Trump administration announced that $716 million in adult education program funding that was supposed to be distributed to states by July 1 was being withheld. The administration said the freeze on these funds was due to a wider review of resources allocated to education, under suspicion that, according to a spokesperson at the Office of Management and Budget, “Many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”  
Last week, facing mounting criticism, the Trump administration said that it will release the adult education funds – along with more than $4 billion in other funding for K-12 schools and higher education that had also been held back.  
That news was a huge relief. Still in place, however, is a directive in letters sent by the US Department of Education to colleges rescinding guidance that had been in place since 1997 that allowed federal funds to be used for undocumented residents in some adult education programs. The letters notified them the “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” executive order signed by President Trump in February is intended to “prevent spending of American taxpayer dollars on Federal assistance for illegal aliens,” and therefore, colleges should no longer admit undocumented students into these programs. 
While the focus in these recent announcements is on ending federal support for undocumented residents, it is clear from other White House communications and actions that the broader agenda is to practically eliminate immigration into the United States entirely. 
In both of his terms in office, the Trump administration has taken aim at each of the principal ways that people from other countries can become naturalized United States citizens, including: 

Family-based sponsorship: A way for a US citizen or lawful permanent resident to sponsor close relatives for a green card that President Trump has derided as “chain migration,” and vowed to curtail by reducing the categories of eligible family members, increasing income requirements, and imposing stricter, more time-consuming vetting processes. 


Employment-based sponsorship: A way for an employer to sponsor a foreign national for a green card with a qualifying job offer that Trump is aggressively trying to limit through stricter interpretation of H1-B visa requirements, setting higher wage requirements for work visas, and enhanced vetting of visa applications, which slows processing time and presents barriers for employers seeking to fill vacant positions. 


Refugee or asylee status: A process used to recognize individuals fleeing their home country because of a fear of persecution that the Trump administration has nearly eliminated by suspending the US Refugee Admissions Program, suspending asylum applications for anyone attempting to cross America’s southern border, and ending Temporary Protected Status designations for asylees from Afghanistan, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and other strife-torn nations. 

These steps are in addition to the Trump administration’s attempts to end birthright citizenship, which has been guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution since 1868; and severely limit the number of international students studying at American universities through travel bans, suspension of visa interviews, social media vetting, and other steps designed to dissuade aspiring scholars from other countries from considering American higher education. 
Despite this array of restrictions on everyday people attempting to emigrate to the United States, Trump has proposed, and even set up a web site for wealthy foreigners interested in applying for, the “Trump Card,” which offers US citizenship to anyone willing to pay $5 million for the privilege. 
The president is not alone in pursuing these immigration restrictions.  Although it passed by the narrowest possible margin in Congress, the recently enacted “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” contains a number of provisions, like a 300 percent increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $45 billion for construction of ICE detention facilities, and $46 billion for border wall construction, designed to deter would-be immigrants to America. 
Taken together, Trump’s executive orders since January and his signing of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” Act represent a radical shift in federal policy toward immigrants, based largely on myths and misinformation, like claims that immigrants are overrunning the US population, are more prone to committing violent crime, and are taking American jobs or relying on welfare assistance. In fact: 

The proportion of foreign-born residents of the US is the same today as it was in the early 1900s. While the share of the population made up immigrants has increased in recent decades, it is now same as it was at the turn of the 20th century. According to the Migration Policy Institute, in 1910, 14.7 percent of US residents were born in other countries. Today, that figure is slightly lower, at 14.3 percent. 


Immigration is stabilizing our population. Massachusetts has experienced a net migration of native-born citizens out of the state each year since 2011, and we have slipped from 9th to 16th place in population size. Immigration has been the only way we did not actually lose population overall. And the same is true across New England, which has the oldest average population of any region in the country and, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has noted, is being reenergized through immigration.  The consequences of losing population are significant, and include a smaller workforce, fewer consumers, and fewer representatives in Washington. 


Immigrants are educated: According to the Migration Policy Institute, 48 percent of recently arrived immigrants have a college degree, compared to only 38 percent of native-born Americans. 


Immigrants are law-abiding: One of the big fears often stoked about immigrants is crime, and accusations that those seeking asylum or citizenship are violent criminals. But numerous studies over the years have demonstrated conclusively that immigrants commit fewer crimes and have lower rates of incarceration than native-born US citizens. 


Immigration improves our economy: According to a study from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, “Most economists agree that the effects of immigration on the US economy are broadly positive,” and include: 


Increased wages: Immigrants often do not compete for the same jobs as native US citizens, putting minimal downward pressure on wages. Rather, immigrants’ consumer needs increase the demands for goods and services, and studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers over the past few decades. 


Improved innovation: Immigrants account for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity. 


Higher tax revenue: Contrary to one often expressed belief, most immigrants, including those in the country without authorization, pay significantly more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. According to a report by Pew Research, immigrants in the US illegally contribute more than $12 billion annually in state and local taxes. The average estimated tax rate of unauthorized immigrants is 8 percent, while the wealthiest one percent of Americans pay just over 5 percent. Approximately 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants contribute to Social Security—a benefit they are not even eligible to receive. 


Saving retirement: The US population is getting older. In 1990, there were five workers in America for every retiree. Now, there are only three. Without immigration, by 2030 that ratio will fall to only two—not enough to sustain our population of retirees. 

Over the past few national election cycles, our nation has seemingly swung from one extreme to another as each party has sought to impose its vision for immigration on a population that appears equally divided over which way to turn. 
A few years ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, ever the pragmatist, suggested that what we really need is “A high wall with a big gate,” an approach that would balance our very real need for national security and social cohesion with our equally compelling need for shoring up our aging, birth-rate-declining population with the energy and vibrancy of immigrants seeking a better way of life. 
The last time Congress passed meaningful comprehensive immigration reform that moved us in that direction was nearly 40 years ago, when President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants and increased funding for border security, but also provided amnesty and a path to citizenship for nearly three million undocumented immigrants. 
President Reagan, and indeed leaders of both political parties until recently, recognized the importance of immigration to the very essence of what it means to be an American. 
In his final speech as president, which is worth taking a few minutes to watch as a reminder of why he was called “the great communicator,” Reagan noted, “We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people—our strength—from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.”  
Then he cautioned, “If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.” 
Four decades later, under the policies being implemented by the Trump administration, we are rapidly spiraling in the direction Reagan feared for the nation. 
Reagan added one more particularly poignant point, which was inescapably obvious to the crowd watching those half-dozen newly naturalized American citizens wave their flags and sing “God Bless America” at the recent graduation ceremony for Northern Essex’s Center for Adult Education: “Those who become American citizens love this country even more.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)As residents rally to alert neighbors to immigration agents around the city, Durham City Council member Javiera Caballero warned Saturday that anyone could be arrested off the street and detained.
Speaking to an audience of around 70 at a “State of Durham” town hall held in the Durham County Main Library, Caballero said the massive boost in funding given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the recent congressional megabill would only embolden the agency to abduct noncitizens and citizens alike.
“Once that money really hits, what’s going to happen to our community is actually quite terrifying. And so when I say we’re going to have to put our bodies on the line, it’s not hyperbole,” Caballero said. “They will disappear folks, they will kidnap folks, and it’s not just going to be folks who, quote, shouldn’t be here.”
Though the discussion, moderated by organizers with Kids Voting Durham and a journalist from INDY Week, ranged from housing and transit to education and crime, the presence of ICE and other ways the city might be targeted by immigration enforcement proved a recurring source of anxiety among audience members.
Caballero said she was proud of the city for mustering an “amazing community response” to ICE agents spotted at the Durham County Courthouse, apparently seeking to detain a man ahead of his initial court appearance. Their presence became widely known through immigrant advocacy group Siembra NC’s “ICE Watch” program, which trains spotters who monitor their communities for ICE amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
“Those are the kinds of things we’re going to have to be doing, bringing attention to it and then really fighting for our community,” she said. “When we say that Durham is a welcoming place, it’s not just a tagline — we believe it.”

‘It’s about mass deportation’
Nida Allam, who chairs the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said standing up to ICE will take a collective effort from residents.
“Showing up when there’s ICE sightings, making sure community is out there to witness, record, document what is happening to make sure that our community stays as safe as possible, and that there’s a record of these incidents so that way we can protect our community,” said Allam, among the local officials who spoke out at the courthouse last month.
She pointed to the case of Greensboro man Mohamed Naser, a Libyan father of five detained in July who has spent weeks in a Georgia detention facility. Though he was granted bond, ICE denied his release. “He has been here on a valid visa, is a pending asylum case, and unfortunately, they have taken him away from his family, he’s the main breadwinner,” she said.

“We know that U.S. citizens have been taken all over this country already, and kept in detention for weeks while they’re trying to get legal services to get themselves out,” Caballero said.
Durham School Board Chair Bettina Umstead stressed that “every student is welcome in our public school system,” and noted that they do not ask for the immigration status of enrollees. Asked how Durham Public Schools would address ICE agents attempting to come onto the property, she was circumspect.
“Our principals all have a guidance document around what to do in the public school system, and I think there was a message sent to families that we are aware of what’s going on,” Umstead said. “We want to be really mindful of what we’re sharing publicly to everyone to make sure that our policies and procedures around safety at school stay something that remain private.”
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham), who billed herself as the bearer of bad news throughout the forum, said the passage of House Bill 318 over Governor Josh Stein’s veto would only expand ICE’s ability to seize North Carolinians. The bill requires sheriffs to vet the immigration status of detainees and hold them beyond their time of release pending ICE action.
“It’s no longer about public safety, it’s about mass deportation, and it’s right out of the Project 2025 playbook,” Morey said. “We’re still going to fight it, we’re going to do all we can to take that back.”
After she alluded to the fact that the bill became law only after a single Democrat joined with Republicans to override the veto, an audience member interrupted: “Let’s name her name, Carla Cunningham.”
‘What’s affordable?’
In stark contrast to clashes over immigration, Durham officials described continued support from the federal government in expanding the city’s and region’s transportation infrastructure.
“The federal government hasn’t really cut transit dollars — that’s not what we’re seeing so far,” Caballero said. “That’s one space that we’re kind of very much holding our breath around, but the federal dollars are still moving forward.”
She described the city’s plan to move forward on a bus rapid transit project through a federal grant, upgrading a line from Duke Hospital through downtown to Wellons Village, one of the highest ridership communities in the city. “Bus rapid transit is basically your regular bus line but way nicer and faster,” she said.

At the interstate level, Caballero noted that federal funding also continues to support the S-Line “Raleigh to Richmond” Amtrak expansion, which is set to create a faster passenger train line connecting Washington to Atlanta through North Carolina and neighboring states. She urged residents to make their voices heard in the upcoming midterm elections to ensure that elected members of Congress continue to support the state’s transit initiatives.
She expressed frustration, however, that so much of the state-level transit dollars are tied to the widening of old roads and the construction of new ones — to the point that the Triangle West Transportation Planning Organization, which she and Allam serve on, expects to forgo much of the North Carolina Department of Transportation funding.
“Having an effective General Assembly that doesn’t hate its cities would be great,” Caballero said. “[We decided] we didn’t want to take NCDOT dollars that were just going to expand roads and make them wider, that we really wanted to move away from that, that it did not align with our goals around transit and climate.”
Allam said transit and housing affordability are the two biggest issues where she sees the potential for bipartisan collaboration. She noted that Johnston County, long a Republican stronghold, is on track to be the fastest growing county in the state from now to 2055 — creating the same pressures around growth that have long affected more urban and left-leaning areas in the state.
“Affordable housing 10 years ago was a Raleigh issue, a Charlotte issue. It wasn’t a Johnston County issue, it wasn’t a Person County issue,” Allam said. “And now, it is.”
Morey said affordability would be out of reach so long as workers in the state are underpaid.
“What’s affordable? When you’re paying people $7.25 an hour minimum wage that hasn’t gone up in 20 years, how are you ever going to have affordable housing?” she asked. “Putting a down payment, the rent, the dream of buying a house is going out of reach for people and we need to do better.”
‘Bored kids cause trouble’
Another area of concern around federal funding is education, city officials said, pointing to after-school and summer programs that rely on money from the Department of Education that has been in doubt. Those funds were frozen by the Trump administration and only released after lawsuits from dozens of states, including North Carolina.
“When that federal freeze happened in the summer, there was a lot of concern from community partners that work directly with our Durham Public Schools students over, can we fund our program? This is where students go after school,” said Umstead, the school board chair.

Officials connected the existence of these programs and other educational opportunities with crime prevention. Discussing gun violence, Umstead touted a “text-to-tip” program allowing students to report potential threats as well as mental health investments like therapy provided on school property.
“The role the school system needs to play is to make sure students have connections to all the opportunities that are listed there,” Umstead said. “How do we make school an exciting place for students to be, that’s a connector to the other places?”
Caballero, a mother of three teenagers, pointed to crime reports showing teenage boys getting access to guns, often stolen out of unattended vehicles, and warned that “bored kids cause trouble.”
“There’s not enough for them to do, you can’t even go to an arcade in most places in Durham because it’s a 21-plus establishment, and so we have to do better by our youth,” she said. “How do we, as a community, make sure that we’re offering what we can to our kids and keeping them busy?”
Speakers also criticized attacks on reading materials and diversity, equity, and inclusion in schools. Morey called a set of bills seeking to ban DEI in North Carolina “horrific,” and said it was vital that lawmakers uphold Stein’s vetoes on them.
“It is criminalizing a concept, diversity, equity, inclusion, our country is built on,” Morey said. “In my eight years, they’re the most despicable bills I have ever seen.”
After the forum, resident David McCole said the bills seeking to ban DEI were his top concern. He added that he was impressed with Morey’s earlier comments on income inequality, adding that he was glad she called out tax breaks given to corporations under changes to North Carolina’s fiscal policy.
“Our General Assembly is not doing enough or anything to look at where we stand and helping our workforce, the people at the lower level of the economic scale,” he said. “How do we improve their ability to be able to afford things such as rent or housing, things along those lines? I loved her comments on that.”
Attendee Najerie McMillian said she was disturbed by the ongoing ICE arrests in the community.
“It’s disheartening to hear what ICE is doing.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
In Utah, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s Office shared its letter  to the Department of Justice in response to its request, which says the state has provided its publicly available voter registration list. Henderson’s office also pushed back on the department’s claim that Utah has “the lowest rate in the nation for voter registration records removed from the voter registration rolls.”
“Utah remains one of the most proactive states for maintaining current and accurate voter registration rolls,” explaining that the department was relying on the limited reporting available from Utah’s 25-year-old system, which is being replaced.
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

She is chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. She has served in the Vermont Senate since 2023 and was previously Montpelier’s mayor from 2018 to 2022.


It has been heartbreaking to see flash flooding occur in Vermont for the past three summers, and increasingly around the country as well. 
I, for one, do not want to let this kind of news begin to feel normal. This is not the Vermont I grew up in. It is already hotter and wetter from climate change, and there are a number of things we can do as individuals, homeowners and renters to be prepared for the next natural disaster. 
What the last three years have taught me is that flooding and erosion can impact anyone anywhere in Vermont, depending on what areas receive intense rainfall. So it’s important that we are all prepared for that possibility.

Every choice we make matters — and the choices we make right now will affect how prepared we are for our next natural disaster. Here are some practical steps you and your family can take to be better prepared for potential flooding events. Some of them may apply to you, some may not, but these are taken directly from Vermont Emergency Management’s website:

Install “check valves” in sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains in your home.
Ensure your home is ready. Where possible, minimize damage from basement flooding by elevating utilities and materials that could be damaged by limited basement flooding.
Anchor fuel tanks to ensure that they do not wash away, which can create a safety and environmental issue inside or outside of the home.
Develop a family emergency kit, which could include food and water, medications, a first aid kit, and a flashlight with extra batteries, amongst other things.
Make a family communication plan. Designate an out-of-state relative as a central point of contact.
Be prepared to turn off electrical power when there is standing water, fallen power lines or before you evacuate. Know how to safely turn off gas and water supplies before you evacuate.
Contact your insurance agent or local government to discuss flood insurance coverage.

Other recommendations from ready.gov include: knowing evacuation routes, safeguarding documents and planning with your neighbors.
Also, if you have not signed up for VT-Alerts — which, according to the state’s website, is “used to notify the public of emergency situations,” such as evacuation information, severe weather advisories and roadway interruptions — now would be a great time to do that. 
You can sign up by following the instructions on the VT-Alert website. WCAX reports that only 90,000 Vermonters have signed up to receive these alerts — 14% of the state’s total population. I would highly recommend doing so to anyone living or working in Vermont.
Finally, I’ll add one recommendation of my own. Since we know these events are driven and exacerbated by climate change, we all also have an obligation to do what we can to reduce our fossil fuel consumption. 
Thankfully, most renewable alternatives are much cheaper to operate than their fossil fuel counterparts. Maybe this means taking the bus or carpooling; leasing or buying an EV or plug-in hybrid; or adding a heat pump, pellet stove or another renewable heating system. 
For each of us the solutions may look different, but it’s important that we are all looking to take that next step toward the ways in which we can reduce carbon pollution.
Meanwhile, the Legislature will continue to have more work to do this next session to protect and prepare Vermont for potential natural disasters. This includes ensuring that Vermont’s dams are safe and that we are protecting our wetlands to help prevent and reduce the risks from these kinds of events in the future.
We all have a part to play. We can all make a difference to ensure that our families and neighbors are safe and able to weather the storms that we know are likely to continue on into the future.
You can access multi-language translations, a free workbook and other resources on the Vermont Emergency Management website.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-03 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Tommy Duff might attempt what few have done: win a governor’s race in first campaign,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/03/tommy-duff-governor-campaign/,"Column: If ultra successful businessman Tommy Duff does run for governor of Mississippi in 2027, history will not be on his side.","If ultra successful businessman Tommy Duff does run for governor of Mississippi in 2027, history will not be on his side.
Duff of Hattiesburg, who along with his brother James are listed as the state’s only billionaires, according to Forbes Magazine, has made no secret of the fact he is considering a run for governor.
If he does, it will mark the first time for Duff’s name to be placed on ballot for public office. The 68-year-old would be starting his political career vying for the highest office in Mississippi.
Combustible Vicksburg contractor Kirk Fordice, a unique politician in Mississippi on many levels, is the only person in the modern era to win the Mississippi governorship in his first venture as a candidate.
All other successful candidates for governor in the modern era have held other elected offices before capturing the seat.
Going all the way back to the 1950s, Ross Barnett was a successful trial attorney before running for governor — his first elected office. He lost the governor’s race twice before finally winning the post in 1959 and then becoming a national figure as he fought to maintain Mississippi’s segregated society.
A few other people have tried to win the governor’s mansion in their first campaigns. They have not been successful.
People always say a candidate needs strong name identification to run for governor. Even though he has not run for statewide office, Duff has the wherewithal and presumably the willingness to write seven — and maybe eight — figure checks to develop that recognition. And with his money, he has the ability to craft the narrative he wants Mississippians to hear.
But what we don’t know yet is whether Duff has the “it” factor. Will Duff look comfortable in his own skin traveling around the state asking people for their support?
Often, though not always, it comes down to the old adage that people vote for the candidate with whom they would have a beer or glass of tea.
It can take a special personality to navigate campaigning. Experience on the campaign trail helps develop the skills to do and say the right things in often stressful circumstances. It helps to be quick on your feet.
Andy Mullins, a longtime administrator at the University of Mississippi and before then an aide to Gov. William Winter, tells the story of Winter campaigning.
Winter entered a drug store in south Mississippi and went to the pharmacist to ask for his support. The pharmacist told him in no uncertain terms, Mullins said, that he would not vote for Winter because he would not help get his son into medical school.
After enduring a verbal beating from the pharmacist, Mullins recalled what Winter said as he left the store: “Put the pharmacist down as undecided.”
Who knows how Duff will perform if he does engage in his first campaign. He may be a natural.
Many thought Tupelo businessman Jack Reed was a natural in 1987 when he entered the governor’s race as a political novice. Indeed, he did appear to be one, but he ran into and lost a close election to a politician with more experience in Ray Mabus.
Reed will go down with others, such as Mike Sturdivant and John Arthur Eaves Jr., who waged and lost their maiden political campaign for the hard-to-obtain office of governor.
Sturdivant, a Glendora farmer and businessman, spent a large sum of his own money running in the Democratic primaries in 1983 and 1987. Eaves also wrote large personal checks to his campaign against incumbent Haley Barbour in 2007.
Duff recently appeared at an economic forum hosted by Mississippi Today and JPMorgan Chase. During his on-stage interview before the hundreds of attendees, he deflected most questions and laid out few policy specifics.
But Duff has plenty of time to develop a campaign platform before the 2027 election. The question is whether he has the skills to connect with Mississippians as he delivers it.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/29120449/MSRS153.jpg,,,2025-08-03 07:56:58.465586

But there are ways to improve those roads that reduce pollution and strengthen against floods.

BURLINGTON — Vermont’s dirt roads span 8,534 miles — more than the straight-line distance between Burlington and San Francisco three times over. They contribute to the state’s rustic charm, bring tourists looking for gravel biking and are beloved by rural residents.
They are also particularly vulnerable to floods. 
Runoff from any type of road can harm water quality, but Vermont has some 1,300 more miles of dirt than pavement — and that dirt is subject to easy erosion. 
With the state experiencing an increase in flooding, those old roads are hitting waterways and their ecosystems hard. 
And the state is pretty much stuck with them. “Putting in paved roads is very expensive, and we just don’t have that kind of funding in Vermont to want to do that,” said Jim Ryan, former manager of the Vermont Municipal Roads Program with the Department of Environmental Conservation.
But there are ways to improve those roads that reduce pollution and strengthen against floods. 
Like paved roads, dirt roads are essentially impervious, meaning they do not absorb water, said Beverly Wemple, a University of Vermont professor who helps lead the college’s Water Resources Institute. When it rains, water washes across those surfaces, eroding sediment and running into ditches or bodies of water.
Phosphorus likes to bind to sediment, meaning it gets swept away too. In excess, it fuels harmful algae blooms — as is the case in Lake Champlain, where runoff has deposited high levels of the nutrient. Large sections of the lake are on the federal impaired waterways list.
Phosphorus aside, those sediments can hurt aquatic ecosystems where plants and animals struggle to survive in water choked with dirt and debris. 
Wemple’s research helped bring attention to dirt road runoff at a time when Vermont was focusing more and more on water quality. 
A 2008 lawsuit alleging poor pollution control forced federal and state officials to revise plans for Lake Champlain. State lawmakers passed the Vermont Clean Water Act in 2015, anticipating stricter standards. Those came a year later when federal officials tightened limits on phosphorus in the lake. 
People wanted a better understanding of where the phosphorus was coming from.
Funded by the Lake Champlain Basin Program, Wemple studied the impact of Vermont’s transportation network on water quality.
Tropical Storm Irene hit while research was underway, allowing Wemple’s team to also see what happens to Vermont’s roads when they flood, she said. 
The study, released in 2013, proved erosion from dirt roads was a significant source of sediment in waterways — and confirmed phosphorus attached to the sediment was polluting Lake Champlain. It also included research on ways to keep water off roads and reduce runoff.
“That research essentially gave us the first piece … of scientific evidence of the importance of our road network as a source of pollutant transfer but also of the potential for some fairly straightforward practices to minimize that pollutant runoff,” Wemple said. 
After the new phosphorus regulations, the state created a permit program that set road standards for towns. It aimed to reduce erosion contributing to phosphorus pollution. The Department of Environmental Conservation and Agency of Transportation run the program. 
Towns must record the condition of their roads and key characteristics — such as whether they connect to water and whether they use storm drains, or ditches and culverts, for drainage. Over half the roads in Vermont connect to waterways, the state says.
The Agency of Natural Resources says open-drainage roads — those with culverts and ditches — are often gravel and produce the most phosphorus. Those roads are where the bulk of the standards are applied.
Towns must upgrade roads not up to code. For a dirt road, this usually means improving drainage: lining ditches with stones and vegetation to filter out sediment.
There are also improvements to the road itself. Crowning a road, or lowering the sides so the high point is in the middle, helps it shed water, as does removing berms and ruts that trap water. Another element: properly sizing culverts, the tunnels that allow water to pass underneath roads. 
“We were able to document that many of these practices are quite effective in both reducing erosion and making the transportation network more flood resilient,” said Wemple. 
Through the Agency of Transportation’s Better Roads Program, towns can apply for grants to cover projects.
Making improvements also helps protect from floods, said Ryan. Working as a deputy stream engineer in the aftermath of Irene, and doing “flood forensics” after the 2023 floods, he found that up-to-standard roads came away in better shape.
Where there was damage, the culprit was most frequently culvert size, he said. Often the issue stemmed from small culverts under driveways or over intermittent streams. In heavy rain, culverts have to handle more water than usual. If they’re too small, they flood or get blocked by debris, leading to a domino effect where one failed culvert takes out several others down the road, Ryan said.
Municipalities are slowly updating their roads. Ryan said Vermont towns have an average of 25 miles of roads running directly into waterways and are upgrading about a mile a year.  
Flood resilience can get a boost right away, but maintenance is ongoing. 
“There’s no finish line there. The road grader always has to go out and put a proper crown on the road, remove the grader berm, lower the road’s shoulders and clean out the ditches,” Ryan said.
His observations are set to be tested: Wemple just began a two-year study on the impact of the road permit program on flood resilience in 2023 and 2024.
“We hear anecdotally … that it looks like places where we’ve upgraded the storm water infrastructure on roads, there were fewer damages,” she said. “But we don’t have the scientific evidence to back that up yet.” 
Wemple said people often ask, Should we just pave the roads?
One factor is uncertainty about which is worse for water quality. Wemple said there’s not much difference between paved and unpaved.
But there’s also what she called “the societal question.”
“Many of us in Vermont are quite attached to our rural landscapes and those unpaved roads,” she said. “And if we paved them, people would drive a lot faster. And we’d lose some of that rural ideal that we are really attached to.” 
Eric Barker lives on a dirt road in Underhill close to where he grew up. When he chose where to raise his family, a dirt road was a priority. 
“I don’t even think we looked at a single lot on pavement,” he said.
His driveway requires a lot of care, and his car has gotten stuck in the mud at inopportune times, but he said it’s worth it.
“I think you have to have the right vehicles, and I think you have to have the right mentality,” he said. He values the privacy his home allows for his family — and the sparse traffic. 
Dirt roads also draw tourism. Waterford resident Fritz Fay is president of Northeast Kingdom Gravel. The organization’s mission is to bring dollars to the Kingdom by mapping gravel biking routes and attracting tourists. 
The sport has exploded in recent years — and Fay said Vermont, with its sprawl of dirt roads, is ready made for it.
Big events and concentrated trails can overwhelm small towns, and locals often resent that, Fay said, but gravel biking is gentler. 
The NEK has witnessed that scenario in East Burke with the popular Kingdom Trails. Gravel biking brings in a few people at a time across multiple towns, Fay said. 
“It’s scattered, and that’s an advantage,” he said. 
The benefits go beyond drawing cyclists, though.
“If all these roads were paved, it’d be one less kind of unique thing to come to Vermont (for),” he said.

WESTON — When the Weston Theater Company announced its musical now playing would be a stage adaptation of the 1954 film “White Christmas,” some locals wondered about the seeming incongruity of orchestrating summer with sleigh bells in the snow.
More residents, however, are worried about an even bigger toppling of tradition.
Upon its start in 1937, Vermont’s oldest professional acting troupe performed in a white-pillared playhouse on the postcard green of its namesake Windsor County town of 623 residents.
In 1962, a fire ravaged everything but the building’s Doric columns. In 1973 and 2011, storm overflow from the neighboring West River flooded the cellar of the restored structure. But come hell or high water, the company always reopened in keeping with the theatrical credo “the show must go on.”
Then on July 10, 2023, a record downpour swallowed up the playhouse’s basement and first floor. The troupe relocated to a smaller second stage at the nearby Walker Farm with hopes of bailing out the main theater in time for that summer’s musical — fatefully, the splashy “Singin’ in the Rain.”
But two years later, the playhouse sits empty as its nonprofit operators wrestle with questions about finances and the future.
“Our estimate right now is we’re three years out from getting back into the building, and when I tell people that, they’re shocked,” said Susanna Gellert, the theater company’s executive artistic director. “They think, ‘Why can’t we be back in tomorrow?’”

The answer, according to all involved, is almost as complicated as the bureaucratic paperwork they’re swimming in.
The theater company doesn’t own the playhouse, which was built as a church in 1839. Instead, the troupe leases it from the Weston Community Association, a volunteer-run nonprofit that also oversees the nearby 1795 Farrar-Mansur House museum and Cold Spring Brook Park.
In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene washed away a $700,000 renovation of the playhouse’s dressing rooms, prop shop and orchestra pit. Twelve years later, the 2023 floodwater rose about 30 inches higher, swelling cleanup costs to nearly $500,000 and the proposed reconstruction to as much as $5 million.
Both the community association and theater company are seeking damage reimbursements from insurance carriers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They’re also planning separate fundraising campaigns to pay for their parts of a shared restoration project.
But the state fire marshal has closed the playhouse to the public until the community association replaces the alarm and sprinkler system — a nearly $200,000 expense that volunteers have yet to figure out how to fund.
“A lot of the people we know who are capable of writing a big check are reluctant to do so until all of the building mitigation has been done,” community association President David Raymond said. “It’s a Catch-22 situation.”

The community association and theater company are not giving up. They recently welcomed U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, to tell him about the cleanup challenges shared by dozens of communities statewide.
“When you look at this town at the helicopter level, we’ve got probably $12 million to $15 million worth of capital needs in the playhouse, fire station, post office, school,” Weston Town Moderator Wayne Granquist said. “That’s incredibly far beyond our capacity to raise money. We need to have external help.”
Welch didn’t promise federal funds, just words of understanding.
“The Weston Playhouse is such a community resource,” the senator said.
Planners are aiming to move all of the playhouse’s electrical and mechanical systems and backstage and storage space above the most recent flood line.
“It’s going to be a push to get the building sustainable, and then a push to get it functional again,” said Rebecca Marzalek-Kelly, the theater company’s general manager.
In the meantime, the theater company is presenting its 89th summer season at its nearby Walker Farm performance space.
“We’re doing what work we can right now so that we’re ready to get back into the playhouse once it’s ready,” Gellert said. “But all of that starts with funding.”
Raymond, for his part, knows the playhouse may be within walking distance of everything in town, but he and his community association colleagues have a long road ahead.
“Hope,” Raymond said when asked what kept him going. “And patience.”

The race to replace Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is crowded on both sides.
Whitmer, a Democrat and potential 2028 presidential contender, is term-limited. The current Democratic primary contenders are Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist; Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson; Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson; and Marni Sawicki, the former mayor of Cape Coral, Florida. If elected, Gilchrist would be the state’s first Black governor.
The crowded Republican field includes Rep. John James, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox and Anthony Hudson, a truck driver who ran for Congress in Michigan’s 8th District in 2024.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, is also running for governor but as an independent candidate, potentially throwing a wrench into the dynamics of what is expected to be one of the closest and most competitive 2026 governor’s races.
Michigan has long been a key swing state — and a pipeline for women leaders — where control of the governor’s office has switched between Democratic and Republican over the last 40 years. Former President Joe Biden won the state by 2.8 points in 2020. In 2024, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin won her election to the U.S. Senate by just 0.3 points while President Donald Trump carried the state by 1.4 points.

(Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Daniel Cressy yawned, tired after three days of watching a machine pull blood out of his body, extract his stem cells and pump the blood back in. Tubes protruded from the side of his neck, preventing him from turning his head. He gestured toward them while sitting in his hospital bed at the Manning Family Children’s Hospital.
“It’s uncomfortable at first, but then you kind of get used to it,” he said Wednesday.
The tubes were annoying, but, to Cressy, the reward is more than worth the discomfort: freedom from sickle cell disease. This procedure marked the first major step toward what he hopes is a long-lasting cure for the rare genetic blood disorder.
Over the next year and a half, Cressy’s genes will be altered to remove the trait that causes his red blood cells to sickle, or harden and bend in a way that blocks blood flow and causes immense pain. He will be the first patient in Louisiana to complete the gene therapy treatment.
The 22-year-old’s stem cells will be sent to a lab in Scotland where they will be treated with an enzyme to reach a specific part of the cells and edit the gene to stop his blood cells from changing shape. Then, Cressy’s edited stem cells will be returned to Louisiana and infused back into his body. More than 90% of the patients in a clinical trial who received this treatment known as Casgevy, went at least a year without sickled cells blocking blood flow.

(Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)
The process is long and expensive. Between insurance approvals, paperwork and preliminary doctor appointments, it took Cressy nearly a year to get to this room. But, for Cressy, it’s the only way to achieve his dream of becoming a commercial pilot.
Three years ago, Cressy discovered his love of flying, but after hours of lessons, working toward his certification, he was told his dream might be impossible. People with sickle cell disease seeking a pilot’s license face scrutiny over their health backgrounds from the Federal Aviation Administration.
High altitudes can make cells more likely to sickle, creating the risk of intense pain while in the air if there isn’t enough oxygen.
“The Office of Aerospace Medicine routinely reviews evolving medical therapies and updates policies when there is proof that new treatments are safe in the aviation environment,” said an FAA spokesperson in a statement.
Cressy applied for his medical certification in 2022 but was rejected despite several appeals. To Cressy, his condition was manageable. Unlike many people with severe cases of sickle cell disease, he hasn’t needed frequent hospital visits and blood transfusions to avoid pain.
“One thing that people don’t understand is that sickle cell affects everybody differently,” he said. “I believed that I could fly without getting cured.” But the FAA disagreed.
When Cressy first asked for the treatment, his hematologist, Dr. Zach LeBlanc, said no. To LeBlanc, a career in aviation didn’t seem like a top medical priority. But Cressy’s passion – and an official rejection from the FAA – changed LeBlanc’s mind.
“The more I got to know him, I understood that it wasn’t as superficial as it appeared the first time,” said LeBlanc, a pediatric hematologist with the hospital who was part of clinical trials to develop another long-term sickle cell cure. “He was really serious about this, and he understood the risk.”

Traditionally, bone marrow transplants have been the primary way to provide long-lasting relief, but patients have to fit specific criteria and find an unrelated donor with a close genetic match. The right bone marrow donor is hard to find, and Cressy didn’t have many options for a cure until two gene therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2023. Children’s Hospital is the first in the state to be approved to administer the treatments.
Cressy and LeBlanc hope other sickle cell patients will soon receive better care.  The Louisiana Department of Health recently estimated that at least 3,000 people in the state have been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.
The disorder occurs mostly in Black people like Cressy. It’s caused by a genetic mutation that evolved and spread across much of Africa as a response to malaria. People who only have one sickle cell gene are at least 90% more resistant to malaria, but if a person inherits two sickle cell genes, they will develop the painful disorder.
Many health care providers and researchers, including LeBlanc, now acknowledge how the medical community has historically neglected and stigmatized patients with the disorder. But LeBlanc believes, especially with the addition of new treatments at Children’s Hospital, that such care is starting to improve.
“Sickle cell disease in the state of Louisiana is hopefully in a time where it can really change,” he said.
There are still vast areas in rural parts of the state where basic care for sickle cell isn’t available, especially for adults, but there’s been an uptick in attention, he said.
Advocates for people living with the disorder say that attention is much needed. Courtney Davis is the deputy executive director of the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana. He said the state legislature has begun to pay more attention to the disorder, forming a commission and starting a registry to monitor the prevalence of the condition in 2021.
“There’s a lack of knowledge about sickle cell,” said Davis, who is also living with sickle cell disease. “We’re always trying to garner more support for sickle cell all over the state.”
Compared to other rare disorders like cystic fibrosis, there’s a large disparity in both public and private funding for sickle cell treatments and cures, researchers have found. Disparities in health care for Black Americans also affect how patients are treated.

Rhonda Chube, a community health worker with the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana, said her clients often face stigma when trying to receive care. They struggle to get hospitals and employers to understand the severity of their pain, she said.
“They may look okay physically, but what’s going on inside their body is where the problem is,” she said.
The condition also comes with financial burden due to hospitalizations, transfusions and regular doctor appointments. Chube and Davis said it’s nearly impossible to survive the disorder  without insurance.

Cressy chose to undergo a gene therapy treatment that cures sickle cell disease in order to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot. (Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)
Many patients also need insurance in order to afford a curative treatment like Cressy’s. The medication alone costs $2 to $3 million. The stem cell collection and infusion, among other doctor visits, add another few hundred thousand dollars.
Lynn Winfield, Manning Family Children’s Hospital’s senior director of patient care services, said it can take more than a year for private insurance providers to approve reimbursement for the procedures. Without that guarantee, neither the patient nor medical providers can afford the treatment. Medicaid recipients are easier to get approved, but Winfield said she worried that could change with recent federal cuts to funding.
Winfield said the hospital is already lining up more patients, including a boy from Shreveport.
Cressy hopes he is only the beginning. He plans to advocate for more people with sickle cell as he goes through treatment and is excited to eventually become one of the first commercial pilots with the disorder. Cressy will be following in the footsteps of a friend with sickle cell who participated in a gene therapy clinical trial in Atlanta two years ago. They met through a Reddit post, bonding over experiencing the same roadblock to aviation. That friend, Cressy said, has since received a pilot’s license.

“Becoming aviators with sickle cell was once something that people thought was impossible,” he said from his hospital bed, wearing a Mr. Impossible t-shirt that he created. “My buddy has already proved to the world that it’s not. Nothing is impossible.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Less than a month after I moved to Durham for graduate school, Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Helene, the deadliest storm to ever hit the state, took 108 lives and caused an estimated $48.8 billion in damage. Less than a year later, Tropical Storm Chantal killed six North Carolinians and did more than $56 million in damage to Orange County. This is just one of the 13 counties for which Governor Stein declared a state of emergency. The physical and emotional trauma being felt during this time reminds me of watching my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana struggle to overcome tragic extreme weather events.
As a Gulf Coast native, I’ve felt the presence of natural disasters my entire life. When I was three, I evacuated New Orleans with my mother and younger sister ahead of Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke, my dad watched the water rise up, filling our street and submerging our front lawn, creeping up the steps to the top lip of our front porch. We were lucky the water began to drain before it could make it into the house.
As I grew older, I felt Katrina’s legacy in New Orleans. Many people were not as fortunate as my family – some lost their homes and others their lives. Some who made it out during evacuations or in the storm’s aftermath never returned to New Orleans. I worry for my family that still lives there.
Throughout my childhood and adolescence, we experienced other large storms. None were as seriously damaging as Katrina, but it was common to wake up to felled tree branches and flooded streets. In 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida whipped through New Orleans, leaving the city without power for over three weeks at the hottest time of the year. Unfortunately, such extreme weather experiences were not limited to my time in New Orleans.
The morning after Chantal hit Durham, my coworkers and I watched live news reports of the 130 casualties caused by flash flooding in Texas. Twenty-seven young girls were killed by the floods while attending a sleepaway camp similar to the one I attended for seven summers.
While watching these reports in shock and horror, I listened to people calling the disaster an unavoidable “act of God.” Of course, we should dedicate thoughts and prayers to the families suffering during this tragedy, but the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather is not random. It is directly attributable to human-induced climate change. To prevent future tragedies, we need accurate forecasts and warnings, timely federal relief programs, more resilient infrastructure, and climate action plans.
It is mystifying to me that the president claimed that he is investing in technology to protect people from extreme weather events on the same weekend he slashed support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and renewable energy. We need to be proactive, not reactive, and that means investing in climate adaptation.
Devastating extreme weather events are our new reality, no matter what state you live in. If it’s not a hurricane, it’ll be a tornado like the one that hit St. Louis in May of this year. Or wildfires like those that burned through Los Angeles in January. Or an extreme heat wave like the heat dome that is triggering heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida this past week.
As someone just starting to establish a career and life as a young professional, I fear the upcoming years during which extreme weather will become an even more powerful and disastrous force. Flooding from Chantal in Durham wiped out an entire suspension bridge in the Eno River State Park, where I frequently hike and recreate with friends. This is reality for my lifetime, and I want to do something about it.
We need to get serious about climate action. Without concerted environmental efforts, communities will continue to suffer, and people will needlessly die. We need to make our voices heard.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182574-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-03 06:56:17.412214

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Nevada has had either the highest or one of the highest unemployment rates in the U.S. over most of the 21st century. In the latest report Nevada has the nation’s second highest jobless rate, behind only the Musk-ravaged District of Columbia.
Occasionally Nevada’s notoriously persistent high unemployment rate is attributed to almost optimistic factors, like an economy in transition that is diversifying away from service sector jobs.
But for all the state tax breaks ladled to pretty much any expanding or relocating company that asks for one, before Trump killed it earlier this year Canadian tourism still supported more jobs in Southern Nevada than manufacturing does. Statewide, manufacturing only accounts for less than 4% of the state’s total employment. Nevada remains primarily a service sector economy with a service sector workforce.
From 9-11 to the Great Recession to the pandemic and now the tariff chaos, every time Nevada’s service economy starts to emerge from a crisis, it gets hammered by another one. (And through it all, the state’s primary industry has taken advantage of the carnage to trim its workforce. In the summer of 2000, 210,000 people were employed in Nevada’s casino hotels; in June of this year, 157,000 were.)
Trump threw one of his trademark Queen of Hearts “off with her head” tantrums Friday and fired U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, because Friday’s BLS jobs report indicated the Trump economy hasn’t been creating anywhere near as many jobs as were being created nearly every month during the Biden years.
Trump insists on government employees who are more dedicated to toadying up to him than faithfully executing the legitimate duties required in their jobs.
So now presumably monthly jobs reports won’t be determined by the Current Employment Statistics survey of more than 100,000 private and public employers, along with analysis and modeling of additional tools used by the BLS. Instead, official employment statistics will be corruptly determined by whatever numbers Trump jots on a poster board with his beloved Sharpie.
Which brings us back to Nevada’s unemployment rate.
Monthly state unemployment rates basically mirror those reported by the BLS. So with Trump now insisting that federal employment data must reflect positively on him, it’s possible Nevada’s official unemployment rate could drop substantially. Not because of an improving Nevada economy, or because fewer people are unemployed, but because of the aforementioned Sharpie.
There are at least two scenarios by which Nevada’s unemployment rate could officially (but not really) drop.
First, Trump could take a break from his busy schedule of tariff madness, Texas gerrymandering, and Epstein nostalgia and notice that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo is on the ballot next year. Trump could order his loyalists installed in the BLS to start lowering Nevada’s unemployment rate month by month. Then, when Democrats point out Lombardo has no economic policy to speak of, Campaign Joe could cite official data indicating the unemployment rate is dropping thanks to his economic mad skills.
Or, echoing his tariff-setting methodology, Trump could just pronounce arbitrary unemployment rates depending on how he feels about some state or other that day.
California? Ewww, a 9% unemployment rate because Gavin Newscum and woke, so Californians need to elect Republicans, Sharpie says.
Nevada? Oh, perhaps a little below the national average, just like Lombardo’s net approval rating. At least until the election. After that, it depends. If Lombardo remains governor and very nicely and publicly proclaims that his reelection was only possible thanks to Trump’s benevolent magnificence, Sharpie will say Nevada’s unemployment is super low. If Lombardo loses, only California’s is higher, or something along those lines.
“When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science,” reads a statement on Trump firing the BLS commissioner issued by a group led by the person Trump named to head the BLS during his first term.
Destroying public trust? Nothing is more dear to Trump’s heart. (See: Democracy and elections, Trump’s undermining of and assaults on.)
“Policymakers themselves are induced to undertake mistaken interventions in the economy if the data upon which decisions are taken is incorrect,” write the authors of a 2024 academic article on governments manipulating economic statistics.
Hmm, guess that’s one way to get the Fed to lower interest rates — trick it with bogus data. What could possibly go wrong?
Closer to home, imagine Nevada’s budget forecasters trying to determine how much money the state can budget for education, public safety, Medicaid and all the other state programs and services if official economic data isn’t worth the poster board it was scribbled on.
Business and industry and banks and investors of course rely on government economic data when making all manner of decisions, so it would be in their interest to see credible research instead of Sharpie jottings. But U.S. corporate and financial powers have been brought to heel, and dare not say a discouraging word, lest Trump unconstitutionally crush them while the U.S. Supreme Court aggressively looks the other way.
“When I become president, it will mark the end of credible, reliable government data, which will be terrible for many, many households, and the history of economic disturbances in this century suggest the effects will be even more damaging in long-struggling Nevada” is not a promise Trump made while campaigning last year.
But if he had, he’d be on his way to keeping it.

Research suggests police officers experience about three traumatic events every six months — roughly 180 over a 30-year career — compared with just one over a lifetime for about half of U.S. adults. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

The measure was tucked into a bigger public health bill, and the odds of passage looked good, she thought. Another advocate had even spoken to Lamont by phone and came away feeling confident in his support. 
But now the word was out that Lamont would veto the broader bill if it included the overdose prevention center.
The provision would have made Connecticut one of the only states in the country to have an overdose prevention center, or OPC, a space equipped with supplies to mitigate the dangers of drug use that would allow people to bring illegal drugs and use them under the supervision of trained staff, equipped with supplies, like Narcan, that can prevent and reverse overdoses.
The concept, though relatively new in the United States, had won approval in the Connecticut Senate, and advocates expected the House to follow suit. They anticipated that Lamont would then sign the bill into law, and that, in time, the new center would join OPCs in states like New York and Rhode Island as a lifesaving instrument in the fight against drug overdoses. 
Last year in Connecticut, just shy of 1,000 people died of an overdose, down 35% from a peak of 1,530 in 2021, according to data from the Department of Public Health. Despite the unprecedented drop in deaths in both the state and country over the past couple of years, overdose remains the leading cause of death for American adults under 45. 
Supporters of overdose prevention centers — also known as supervised consumption or safe injection sites — say they are a crucial part of the fight to save lives, one that has for too long been avoided in the U.S. out of stigma and fear. With the availability of naloxone, the overdose reversal drug, saving lives is relatively straightforward as long as people don’t use drugs alone. Therefore, advocates say, the argument in favor of OPCs comes down to a simple truth: no one can recover from substance abuse disorder if they are dead. 
Skeptics question the legality of the centers and whether they encourage people to continue using instead of seeking treatment. Some also worry about their impact on the neighborhoods where they are placed. 
Evidence from around the world indicates that no one has ever died of a drug overdose at an OPC and that the facilities reduce public drug use and decrease demand on local emergency services without increasing crime. But accounts from advocates and community leaders in Rhode Island, New York City and Canada show that, even with evidence, it can take time to build approval among a public that isn’t familiar with the concept.

Lamont: “Wait and see” 
That afternoon at the Capitol, despite reports of the governor’s disapproval, Santos and other advocates kept on talking to legislators, hoping through some political maneuvering that their key issue would prevail.
But behind closed doors, the measure appeared doomed. The governor’s staff told House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, that Lamont would veto the bill if it included OPCs. In an effort to save the rest of the sprawling legislation, which tackled issues from fluoride in drinking water to pancreatic cancer screening, lawmakers sacrificed the OPC measure.
“Just complete disappointment,” Santos said of the result. “Just heartache and heartbreak and feeling like I was letting my son down all over again.”
In an interview with The Connecticut Mirror in July, Lamont said he had wanted more time to consider results from other states and see whether the facilities draw the ire of the Trump administration. 
“I think I said I’d have to take a look at it, but I’d be pretty reluctant to do it. I think it’s pretty early,” Lamont said. “I think Rhode Island really hadn’t gotten going yet. New York was going. Donald Trump was in office. He was coming down pretty hard.”
Plus, he said, Connecticut already uses nearly every tool at its disposal to combat the overdose crisis, including four harm reduction sites, with a fifth slated to open in Bridgeport, where people can get wound care, clean syringes, connection to counseling or just a cup of coffee.
“We have harm reduction sites already,” Lamont said. “We do everything in terms of Narcan and prevention and counseling and clean needles and such. We do everything except for the drug injection. And I just figured it was worth a little more wait-and-see.”
Lamont referenced a few conversations with individuals skeptical of the sites or their impact but said he hadn’t been on the receiving end of any significant opposition to the idea, either.
The legality of overdose prevention centers is itself controversial. Some question whether the centers violate the federal Controlled Substances Act, which prohibits maintaining a site “for the purpose of … using illegal drugs.” Others argue the law doesn’t apply to public health programs meant to prevent death. The sites in New York City and Providence have been able to operate mostly unbothered, but a 2019 Department of Justice lawsuit prevented the opening of an OPC in Philadelphia. 
An executive order issued by the Trump administration last month directed agencies to withhold discretionary grants from organizations like “safe consumption sites” that allow for illicit drug use.
Lamont did, however, suggest a willingness to consider the policy.
“It’s not something we’re saying ‘hell no’ to,” Lamont said. “Let’s just get a little more experience based on Rhode Island and perhaps a couple other states.” 
But the wait-and-see approach has enraged some advocates who say that people are dying now — advocates like Dita Bhargava of Greenwich, whose son died of an overdose in 2018. 
“I know the governor. I know he has a compassionate heart. But at the end of the day, I think, unfortunately, he doesn’t understand the disease. He doesn’t understand the gravity of this epidemic. Lives that can be saved are being lost.”

Other states are also taking it slow 
Lamont isn’t the only state leader taking a cautious approach, however. In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure in California that would have allowed an “unlimited number” of sites, though he said he remained open to discussing a “truly limited pilot program.” Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont vetoed an OPC bill in 2022 and again in 2024, but, the second time around, lawmakers overrode his veto. 
In 2023, Connecticut’s Public Health Committee introduced a bill to establish three “harm reduction centers” that would include, among other services, a space where people could bring drugs to use under supervision. But legislators removed on-site drug use from the version that went to the broader legislature out of concerns from the administration about the use of state funding and conflicts with federal law, according to Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, the co-chair of the Public Health Committee.
This year’s effort would have established a pilot program of four OPCs without tapping state funding. The centers would include access to substance use disorder and mental health counseling, laundry, bathrooms and showers. The Public Health Committee passed the measure as a stand-alone bill, and the Senate cleared it as part of a sprawling public health bill.
Republican lawmakers on the committee, who nearly unanimously voted against the measure, voiced concern about the centers’ effects on surrounding communities and questioned whether they encourage drug use instead of treatment. 
During an eight-hour public hearing, advocates presented personal stories and real-world evidence, including studies suggesting the facilities prevent overdose deaths for clients, increase uptake of treatment services, reduce emergency-related health care costs and reduce public drug use and publicly discarded drug paraphernalia, without increasing crime rates in the surrounding areas.

Cameron Breen helps to coordinate the Statewide Harm Reduction Project, or SHaRP, a group of more than 100 overdose prevention advocates from around the state. He said the focus on abstinence-only solutions can be frustrating. 
“People think that the only truly successful intervention is the person stopping to use drugs altogether,” he said. “The reality is that substance use exists and too many of our community members are dying.”
But Breen agreed there’s room to increase community outreach in the future.
“Without it, we’re left in this limbo of people not having a good understanding of how much these centers save lives,” Breen said.
Rep. Tracy Marra, a Darien Republican and the only member of her party in favor of the measure during the Public Health Committee vote, said she understands her colleagues’ hesitation around community buy-in and potential effects on crime. 
Marra agrees the sites reduce overdose deaths but said she’s also interested in exploring other interventions that could be effective, like cleaning up the drug supply and stopping drugs from coming in across the border. 
With just three OPCs in the U.S., Marra added that studies about the effects of overdose prevention centers in this country are necessarily limited. There are over a hundred sites around the world, but what might work in Vancouver, for example, may not play out the same way in Waterbury, she said. Plus, she had concerns that the Connecticut bill proposed establishing four sites across the state, when New York City, with well over double the population, has only two.

Part of her questioning nature, Marra said, comes from witnessing the beginnings of the opioid crisis firsthand as a pharmacist. 
“We were taught as pharmacists that if someone was in pain, they would not get addicted to opioids,” Marra said. “Shame on me if I believe anything that quickly again.”
Marra has focused her legislative work in part on addressing the crisis, including a 2023 proposal to put Narcan in vending machines. During a visit to one of the OnPoint sites in New York City a few years ago, Marra became convinced OPCs were a powerful solution. But still, she said, the decision to establish them in Connecticut is “much more nuanced than that.” Other factors, like location and timing, have to make sense, too.
She encouraged elected officials, including Democrats voting ‘yes’ along party lines, to visit.
“Seeing the site, seeing this done, was definitely eye-opening,” Marra said. “If you don’t know what this is about, then go see.”

Success in Rhode Island
In an understated brick building in the heart of Providence’s medical district sits one of three OPCs in the entire country, Project Weber/RENEW. 
From the outside, Project Weber/RENEW looks much like the OB/GYN and spinal health offices that surround it. The first floor is a common space that feels like a cross between a church basement and a community center, outfitted with showers and laundry machines. There’s also a medical suite, staffed with a full-time nurse, behavioral health physician and part-time doctor, available for walk-in patients, with or without insurance. 
On the second floor, clients find the OPC. It’s a meticulously clean environment, with the hospitality of a better-quality medical office. There are individual stations for people to use illegal drugs with sterile supplies, a smoking room with a robust ventilation system, and of course, overdose-reversing naloxone kits. There are also oxygen tanks, which can prevent an overdose without painful withdrawal side effects.

The atmosphere is calm; a mellow Macy Gray song plays from a speaker, and staff members discretely check in on clients every 10 to 15 minutes. There’s even a room equipped with soft surfaces for when clients inadvertently take a drug that agitates them.
The center opened in Providence in January and has received high marks from advocates, elected officials and community members. The staff exude pride in the OPC and their lifesaving work. But the road to realizing that goal was a long and at times heartbreaking slog, one that could offer lessons on Connecticut’s stalled effort to open a center of its own. 
It took multiple attempts before Rhode Island’s governor, Dan McKee, signed an OPC bill in 2021, creating a two-year pilot. But the center still had to be funded, ultimately achieved with $2.6 million in settlement funds from opioid lawsuits. Then, organizations had to bid for the contract. 
Project Weber/RENEW won the bid. The group was already doing harm reduction work, like providing clean syringes, wound care supplies and access to medical treatment. But to open the OPC, they had to find a location and win approval from the Providence City Council.

City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris represents Ward 11, home to the hospital district. She grew up and raised four kids here. When it comes to Ward 11, “I just love it.” 
Harris had some concerns about the OPC (like this common question: wouldn’t the OPC encourage drug use?). She wasn’t necessarily against the idea, but she didn’t want it in her ward, which includes Upper South Providence, a majority Black and Hispanic neighborhood where about a third of residents live below the poverty line. Neighbors there “had more than their fair share” of the city’s social services. 
“No, absolutely not,” Harris remembers thinking at the time.“It’s just too much pressure on the ward.”
Harris prides herself on being a good listener and making decisions based on consensus; in rejecting the OPC, she believed that she was representing her constituents. 
But in the months that followed, Harris began to hear from others, including advocates from Project Weber/RENEW, like Deputy Director Ashley Perry. Perry has lived experience with drug use and got involved with the organization as a volunteer running support groups for sex workers. Perry had been reluctant to engage with recovery groups in the past, which are often structured around repentant confessions.
“It didn’t feel good to always be reminded of the worst things that I’ve done,” Perry said. “I really wanted to move past that, and I really wanted to find safer ways for people who I knew were still suffering in a lot of different ways.” Project Weber/RENEW felt different, a nonjudgmental group giving people the tools to reduce harm and stop using drugs when they were ready.

But after Perry started volunteering, fentanyl sent the overdose death rate soaring. Then COVID worsened the isolation of the community, contributing to a leading cause of overdose: using alone. 
The group staged a mock funeral procession in January 2021, with doctors carrying caskets on their shoulders, representing 384 people who had died in the nation’s smallest state of an overdose the previous year. 
As time went on, Perry and her team became a constant presence in community and state-level meetings on the opioid epidemic, explaining why an OPC was needed. Their team also responded to calls from the community, like requests to pick up needles in neighborhoods. They were, Harris said, relentless. And Harris began attending meetings, too. 
“The more I attended, the more I understood, the more I heard people struggling, the more I heard people losing their family members, the more I heard drug addicts who said, ‘I’m not ready to stop using drugs.’”
Harris’s own granddaughter died of a fentanyl overdose during that time period, at age 26, a young woman she describes as joyful and creative. Harris believes an OPC might have saved her life. 
But it was before her death that Harris came around to the idea of putting the OPC in Ward 11, a change of heart she attributes partly to the location of the building. The proposed location wasn’t in a residential neighborhood or on a Main Street like she feared. Rather, it was a building in the medical district, accessibly located on a bus line.
Between opening day on Jan. 13, 2025, and July 8, Project Weber/RENEW saw 460 unique clients and performed 99 interventions to prevent overdose. They haven’t lost anyone to overdose so far. 
Perry and Harris are quick to talk about the importance of community buy-in as Connecticut considers its own OPC.
In New York City, where the two other OPCs in the U.S. are located, that kind of participation did not happen. City Councilwoman Carmen De La Rosa explained to The Connecticut Mirror that she learned, along with her constituents, during a press conference on the last day of former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration that New York would get two OPCs and that one of them would be located in her district of Washington Heights, a low-to-middle income neighborhood where about half of residents are immigrants. 
“I have to say that that has caused a lot of trouble in terms of the community feeling involved,” De La Rosa said. That includes the choice of location — near one of the largest and most popular parks in the neighborhood.
Though the OPC has since made progress in gaining some community support, De La Rosa said that complaints persist, and she’s often blamed for the OPC, even though she had no say in where it was located. 
“The minute someone runs into a needle somewhere, they bring up the OPC,” she said. “The needle could just have come from someone who is in the throes of addiction and was using on that street. But they’re like, ‘Well, you know, if that OPC wasn’t here, they wouldn’t be able to get needles.’” 
 She wonders what it might have been like if the community had been involved from the get-go, as they were in Providence.

What’s next for Connecticut?
In late May and early June 2025, a spike in overdoses took dozens of lives in New Haven County, sparking a desperate attempt to stem a fatal mix of drugs. As this was taking place, Lamont sent out a press release announcing a significant drop in overdose deaths for 2024. 
Though the release nodded to the seriousness of the issue, it did not mention the crisis that was unfolding. Advocates like Diane Santos, already raw from Lamont’s singlehanded move to prevent OPCs, said the announcement was jarring. 
“To me it says he is either out of touch himself, or he’s getting bad information from somewhere.”
When a bill fails, advocates and lawmakers usually put their heads together and consider what strategy they might try next time to turn public opinion and rally support from other lawmakers. But some advocates in Connecticut say they already had the votes, and there was no public testimony opposing the concept, so they now face a different scenario: they must convince an audience of one, Gov. Lamont, to support the measure. 
Sen. Anwar was among the most committed advocates of the OPC measure. Since the measure failed, he has been publicly criticizing Lamont and says he’s calling Lamont out every time there is an overdose death. 
“It still makes me sad, and it makes me angry,” Anwar said of Lamont’s decision. “Because I value our citizens, and for somebody to make a decision knowingly and then shrug it away like it’s not a big deal is unacceptable to me.” 
Bhargava also lobbied for Lamont’s support. Her son, Alec Pelletier, had been in and out of treatment for substance abuse disorder when he died of an overdose on his birthday in 2018 while living in a sober home. Like Harris’s granddaughter and Diane Santos’s son, he was 26. 
Over the past year, as a student at the Yale School of Public Health and as an advocate, Bhargava educated herself about OPCs, visiting one in Vancouver and speaking with the program managers of the centers in Rhode Island and New York. She came away convinced that such a center could have saved her son’s life. 
The issue, she says, is simply too urgent to wait.  
“We don’t have the time. We just don’t. The time is now. And Gov. Lamont should hold a special session and get this done to save the people’s lives he’s serving to protect.” 
When asked if he would visit an OPC, Lamont said he’s open to it. 
“Visit or call, we’ll see what happens. I don’t want to overpromise. I have an open mind, if that’s what you’re suggesting,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAFE-CONSUMPTION-SITES-0716-SR-22-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-03 05:56:41.418493

Over 100 organizations statewide are uniting to End Child Poverty Now through bold, coordinated advocacy and urgent policy reform.","While Connecticut, one of the wealthiest states in our country, may seem like an ideal place to raise a family, for far too many children it is not. Nearly one in 10 children in Connecticut grows up in poverty. In the City of Waterbury, that statistic is more than double –  with 22% of children living in poverty.
For these kids – our kids – basic needs like stable housing, nutritious food, and access to quality childcare aren’t guaranteed, and the educational opportunities they deserve are often out of reach. While some areas boast world-class schools and enrichment programs, children in poverty are being left behind.
So, is Connecticut a great place to be a child? For many, the answer is no —especially when poverty limits opportunities and dreams feel distant.

That’s why more than 100 organizations – hospitals, higher ed institutions, nonprofits, philanthropy and experts throughout the state — have come together and pledged to End Child Poverty Now! Almost every community foundation serving our 169 towns is involved and leading local efforts to raise awareness, convene partners and advocate on behalf of our state’s children who do not have enough to thrive.   
Morally, we know that this should not be.  Sixty-one years ago, in his 1964 State of the Union Address, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced an unconditional war on poverty and called it a national disgrace that merited a national response. Unfortunately, those calls went unheard until the COVID-19 pandemic brought the issue to the forefront. The pandemic served as an unprecedented global crisis, but it also revealed the profound impact of targeted government assistance in alleviating poverty.  

Through programs like emergency food aid and the refundable child tax credit, we saw a dramatic decrease in child poverty across the United States. In Connecticut, the federal government provided $2,000 to $3,000 in child tax credits per child, and child poverty was reduced by nearly 70%. However, as we now know, this progress was short-lived. The expiration of key pandemic relief programs in 2023 led to a sharp increase in child poverty, serving as a stark reminder that without sustained investment in social safety nets, progress remains fragile at best.

Children in Connecticut were not spared! Even here, with our great wealth, Connecticut experienced skyrocketing child poverty since 2022. According to the report, “Poverty in the U.S. and Connecticut 2019-2023,” by the Connecticut Voices for Children, the supplemental poverty rate was 10.5 percent in 2020, or 74,520 children living in poverty.  By 2021, the child poverty rate had dropped to 6.8 percent or 27,080 children.  Yet, by 2023, our numbers have skyrocketed and exceeded pre-pandemic level. 
This spike tells us that when families have access to financial resources, they can meet their children’s basic needs, invest in education, and create a stable environment in which their children can thrive. To let these gains slip away is not just an economic failure, it is a moral failure. 

The data is clear. Still far too many children in our state are growing up without the things that they need. Child poverty is not inevitable. It is not a natural condition. It is a policy choice and we can advocate for different choices.Kathy Taylor, President and CEO, Connecticut Community Foundation

In June, Connecticut Community Foundation hosted a public forum and panel discussion featuring a Community Data presentation with Mark Abraham, Executive Director DataHaven, and a panel discussion moderated by Ginny Monk, housing reporter for The Connecticut Mirror, with Panelists Emily Byrne, MPA, Executive Director of CT Voices for Children; Chelsea Harris, Director of Early Care & Education, Waterbury Bridge to Success, and Rashida Rattray, Education and Outreach Coordinator, Connecticut Fair Housing Center. Their wide-ranging conversation was both enlightening and sobering; serving as a wake-up call to remember the children and families left behind in our highly resourced state.
This moment calls for a renewed commitment to ending childhood poverty – a commitment that must be underpinned by policy change. The End Child Poverty Now Campaign is a unified platform for advocacy behind a common vision: a thriving and economically robust Connecticut where no child experiences the debilitating effects of poverty. 
This nonprofit advocacy collaborative engages lawmakers and policy influencers to promote and enact policies that address the root causes of child poverty, including income inequality, access to healthcare, safe and affordable homes, and quality education. 
Our collective goal for the 2025 legislative session was to advance the following:  

Support a permanent, refundable CT Child Tax Credit at $600 per child. 
Support universal no-cost healthy school meals (breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack).  
Support universal childcare subsidies for families earning up to 85% of the State Median Income.
Expand good cause eviction protections to support family housing stability. 

We made progress: Connecticut chose to invest in our children’s education, approving a suite of bills designed to enable thousands of additional children to enroll in early childhood education programs. But our work is not finished, and the 2026 legislative session is soon approaching. 
The End Child Poverty Now will continue to advocate for the passage of child-friendly policies that will lead to meaningful change for many more of our children.  We cannot sit and watch while our neighboring states make steady progress to end child poverty.  Now is the time for our vision of being a child-friendly state to be reflected more fully in the everyday experiences of all of our children and families within our state of Connecticut.

It was Monday, Aug. 6, […]","The A Bomb Dome in Hiroshima stands in 2015. The dome, which was part of the city's industrial exhibition hall, was directly beneath the atomic bomb dropped Aug. 6, 1945. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)It was such a peaceful morning that Yoshito Matsushige could scarcely believe it was wartime.
Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer who had been up most of the night before covering air raid warnings, woke from a brief nap at army headquarters in time to see the sun rise over Hiroshima.
It was Monday, Aug. 6, 1945.
Now we know Matsushige was witnessing the last sunrise of the age before humankind had developed a weapon powerful enough to annihilate itself — and had demonstrated a willingness to use it.
There had been just one other explosion of a nuclear bomb, a test shot July 16 of a plutonium implosion weapon at the Trinity Site in southern New Mexico. The resulting fireball had fused the sand of the desert floor into a kind of glass later named Trinitite. On the morning of Monday, Aug. 6, another atomic bomb — a uranium gun-type device — was bound for Hiroshima.
Wednesday marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, a grim milestone that has me pondering the nature of time, memory and hope. It’s been slightly more than an average human lifetime since the bomb devastated Hiroshima, and those who are still around to recount the unthinkable are increasingly few. Once Hiroshima and Nagasaki fade from living memory, how will its warning be passed to future generations?
At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, an American B-29 named the Enola Gay, after the pilot’s mother, released a 12-kiloton atomic bomb over the city. The aircraft was flying six miles up. The aim point was a T-shaped bridge in the center of the city. The bomb fell for 43 seconds and then detonated at 1,968 feet.
What happened next took only milliseconds.
The temperature on the ground reached 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit, vaporizing humans near the epicenter and leaving only their shadows behind. A 1,000-mph blast wave spread from the epicenter, destroying two-thirds of the city’s homes and buildings and contributing to a massive firestorm. A dark mushroom cloud rose over Hiroshima, carrying deadly radioactive fallout.
Matsushige had left army headquarters and returned to his home, about a mile and a half from the target bridge, where he was sitting shirtless in the August heat eating a meager breakfast of rice.
“There is an explosive called magnesium that is used for photographic (lighting) and everything went white as if that magnesium had been fired,” Matsushige told me through an interpreter in 1986, when I was a young reporter in Japan on a grant project to interview those who had experienced the bomb. “It seemed the light was an electrical short, or spark. So I was about to stand up and try to switch off the light, … and then came the blast.”
The force lifted Matsushige from his feet and slammed him into a far wall. He was covered in debris and broken glass, and his bare chest was bleeding, although he wasn’t badly hurt. He and his wife ran outside and hid in a sweet potato field for 40 minutes in the dirty brown gloom of ash and dust. Then Matsushige put on his uniform, retrieved his Mamiya camera from the rubble of his home and two rolls of film, and set out for newspaper office in the heart of the city.
Matsushige was a photojournalist but like most everyone else in Japan had also been pressed into military service. He worked for both the city newspaper and military headquarters, wearing a uniform with no rank insignia. Civilian photography was prohibited.
When he was about a kilometer, or six-tenths of a mile, from the center of the city, he had to turn back because the fire was too intense. He made his way to the Miyuki Bridge. The bridge was a landmark in a city known for its bridges and river, but this morning it was swarmed by thousands of wounded and dying civilians.
In 1986, I stood with Matsushige on the Miyuki Bridge and he told me what he had seen 41 years earlier. It was one of the last times the photographer, then in his early 70s, would visit the bridge, which was closed and about to be demolished to make way for a new structure. My interview with Matsushige originally appeared in my newspaper, the Pittsburg (Kansas) Morning Sun, which had sponsored my application for the Akiba Project travel grant to interview the aging hibakusha, a Japanese term translated as those who had received or been exposed to the bomb. In 2021 I wrote about my memories of that assignment for the Reflector.
Matsushige told me in 1986 that he had yet to take a single photograph on his grim trek into the city but here, at the bridge, he readied his Mamiya. Many of those on the bridge were junior high school students. Unlike elementary school children, most of whom had been evacuated to relatives and others in the hills around the city, the junior high students had been kept in the city to clear fire lines or to work in the ammunition factories. The victims on the bridge looked as if their clothes were hanging from their bodies, but they weren’t trailing fabric, it was tattered pieces of their own skin.
“I thought that I would take a photo of (the scene on the bridge), so I checked the camera in my hands,” Matsushige said. “When I saw this tragic scene, I was unable to push the shutter button. Among these people, there was a person holding a child. She was crying the name of the baby, and the baby probably was dead. The mother was saying, ‘Please open your eyes, please open your eyes.'”
It took Matsushige more than a quarter of an hour to make a photo.
“I felt as if the eyes of these people were piercing me,” he said. “These people had black faces because of the burns. It was such cruelty. I couldn’t stop my tears as I tried to take that second picture, and I remember that the viewfinder of my camera was blurred because of the tears.”
He returned home but set out again that afternoon.
He attempted to go to the newspaper office again but found it ablaze. He passed Hiroshima University, where he saw corpses at the bottom of a swimming pool that had been nearly emptied by the heat. The deeper he went into the city, the greater the destruction.
“People were under collapsed buildings and utility poles and were buried alive,” he said. “Among (the corpses) there were some mothers with children. I was totally numb. I didn’t feel anything, didn’t feel any heat or pain.”
He found a streetcar filled with corpses.
“All their clothes were burnt off,” he said. “I thought about taking a picture, I put my hands on my camera at one time, but since all these dead people were naked, I felt (ashamed) to take such a photo.”
Hours later he found himself back at the Miyuki Bridge, where he took a photograph of an injured policeman writing out relief certificates for food rations. The photo of the policeman was the last Matsushige would take that day. He had carried enough film for 24 exposures but ended up making only five. Two of the photos were at his home, two on the bridge, and one at an intersection near the bridge.
  Only five photos were made the day the bomb fell on Hiroshima, all by the same man — Yoshito Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer. He was at home at the time the bomb was dropped on the morning of. Aug. 6, 1945, He made his way into the city. The first photo he took, around 11 a.m., was of badly burned junior high school students on the Miyuki Bridge. What appears to be rags is, in many cases, skin hanging from arms and legs. (Yoshito Matsushige)
Matsushige took some of the hardtack biscuits next to the policeman’s station for his and his wife’s dinner. After it was dark, he developed the film in trays in the kitchen sink and washed the negatives in a nearby creek. He hung the strip of film in a tree to dry. The photos weren’t published in the Hiroshima newspaper until the next year. They didn’t appear in the United States until Life magazine published them in 1952.
The death toll at Hiroshima was horrific. Estimates vary widely, but at least 70,000 died from the bombing. Three days later, on Aug. 9, a plutonium bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing another 40,000. These are conservative estimates, however, and the actual number might be double for each city.
When I went to Japan to interview Matsushige and the other hibakusha in 1986, it was the height of the Cold War. There were 70,374 nuclear warheads deployed or in stockpiles around the world, according the Federation of American Scientists, an all-time high. Of those, all but a few thousand belonged to the United States and the Soviet Union. The Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist’s graphic representation of how close we were to nuclear annihilation, was at six minutes to midnight.
Now the Doomsday Clock is at 89 seconds.
There are fewer nuclear weapons — about 12,000, according to the FAS — but there are hot wars around the world, tensions are high, and the Doomsday Clock now takes into account other existential risks.
“We now move the Doomsday Clock from 90 seconds to 89 seconds to midnight — the closest it has ever been to catastrophe,” the Bulletin said in a January 2025 statement. “Our fervent hope is that leaders will recognize the threats posed by nuclear weapons, climate change, and the potential misuse of biological science and a variety of emerging technologies.”
The Bulletin cited emerging and re-emerging disease and the military use of artificial intelligence as concerning. It also said threat of nuclear war had been exacerbated by various conflicts.
“The war in Ukraine, now in its third year, looms over the world,” it said. “The conflict could become nuclear at any moment because of a rash decision or through accident or miscalculation. Conflict in the Middle East threatens to spiral out of control in a wider war without warning.”
The 10 or so countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and the role of their arsenals, the Bulletin said, and the nuclear arms control treaty process is collapsing.
We seem hellbent on our own destruction.
In my hand is a relic of the birth of the nuclear age, a bit of Trinitite that my wife, Kim, bought at a rock shop in New Mexico near Alamogordo. Yes, it’s legal to possess because it was gathered from the site decades ago, and no, it’s no longer dangerously radioactive. Why did she want it? Because she gathers information of all kinds — books, objects, experiences — that will help her understand the beauty and darkness of the world. The Trinitite sample cost a few bucks and is only mildly radioactive. It’s about the size of a peanut, is greenish black, and weighs about the same as the albatross in the Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.
Trinitite is among the artifacts that were to be included in the Library of the Great Silence, a catalog of objects representing transitions and periods of existential threat. The project was part of the SETI Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to the search for intelligent life beyond earth. The library is a response, in part, to the Fermi Paradox. Posed by physicist Enrico Fermi, the paradox asks why, given how vast and old the universe is, we haven’t found evidence of other communicative technological civilizations?
I won’t bore you with the math behind the Drake Equation, which seeks to estimate how many intelligent worlds there might be out there, except to cite the most important variable, L. That stands for the average lifespan of technological civilizations. One explanation for the great silence is that civilizations have a tendency to destroy themselves. Nobody knows what L might be, because we have a lack of observable data, but our current estimate is at least 80 years.
If we are not to fall into the great silence, we must learn to do a better job of passing on the lessons of the past. Part of that is honoring the testimony of those who have gone before, such as Yoshito Matsushige.
Matsushige died in 2005, at the age of 92, but his words and his pictures live on. They were given to me in 1986, and now I share them with you.
The time the bomb detonated will be observed with a moment of silence at 8:15 a.m. Wednesday in Hiroshima. That’s 6:15 p.m. Tuesday for most of Kansas, because of the 14-hour time difference.
Honoring the dead is proper.
But too many of us who yearn for peace content ourselves with prayer and visualization. This may be mentally healthy and personally satisfying, but it’s not enough to turn policy or change minds. The pursuit of peace is an active one, requiring a knowledge of the past combined with a willingness to engage the future.
It’s 89 seconds to midnight.
Let’s raise some L.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-03 08:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Metro-North’s higher fares, new rules equal bad optics",Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/03/metro-norths-higher-fares-new-rules-equal-bad-optics-for-ct/,"CT commuters will be paying more, but getting no improvements in Metro-North service.","As predicted, fares are going up on Metro-North by 5% starting September 1 with another 5% hike coming next July. 
The final approval came days ago from the MTA, parent of Metro-North, which rubber-stamped the Connecticut Department of Transportation’s fare hike decision.  At least one MTA Board member called the hikes “scary” and another exclaimed that he was “actually kind of offended”.  But, hey… there is nobody on the MTA Board representing Connecticut riders so they both voted to approve the hike as did the entire MTA Board.  After all, it’s not their money.


Mind you, the MTA is also shortly expected to approve a 4.4% fare hike for New York’s Metro-North riders as well as a 25-cent increase for New York City subways and buses, so put that in your pipe of moral indignation and smoke it.
As I explained a few weeks ago, the Connecticut fare increase can be blamed on Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature, which knowingly under-cut the CDOT budget, pretty much telling the agency to raise fares to make up the difference.  After all, they seem to assume that everyone who rides Metro-North along Connecticut’s “gold coast” is a millionaire. 
But a 10% increase in one year?  On top of a 4.5% hike just two years ago?  That adds up to a compounded 15.2% increase since 2023… way more than inflation.  Remember, Metro-North has a captive audience and can do anything it wants.

And adding insult to injury, there are new ticket rules coming!
With more and more commuters buying one-way e-tickets (57%) instead of monthly passes (36%), those tickets will automatically be activated on purchase, not when you get on the train and activate them yourself.  Why?  Because, the railroad says, 55% of ticket holders don’t activate their tickets until they see the conductor coming around. 
But isn’t it the conductor’s job to collect those fares and put seat checks on each row?
According to MTA Deputy Chief Jessica Lazarus “Conductors are spending more than 20,000 hours each year reminding customers to activate one-way mobile tickets.” Really?  How did they come up with that metric?
Requiring activation of the ticket at time of purchase, she says, will “recapture those hours that can be better put to use for fare collection and train safety operations.”  Like enforcing the “no radios rule” and “no feet on seats?”
If you’re doing a same-day roundtrip you won’t buy two one-way tickets but, instead, a new Day Pass.  It’s good for unlimited travel until 4 a.m. the next day. Day-trippers using the pass will get a 10% fare discount compared to buying two one-way peak tickets.
For hybrid commuters, after buying ten one-way tickets within two weeks the 11th will be free.  For seniors, the disabled and those on Medicare, the new reduced fare ticket will be valid at all times, even in the morning peak.
Make no mistake:  fare evasion is a serious problem for MTA, which estimates they lose $700 million each year, most of it on buses ($315 M) and subways ($285 M).  Metro-North losses are estimated at $44 M.  Given that train fares are much more expensive than bus and subway, that’s not a lot of commuter scofflaws; just 6% of riders compared to 15% of subways riders and 37% of bus passengers.

Of course, bus riders can easily board by the rear door and subway riders can jump over turnstiles.  On Metro-North we have conductors.  It’s an hour-long ride from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal, plenty of time to look at everyone’s ticket… which they will still have to do even under the new rules.
But what about the Dashing Dan running to make his train, grabbing a seat and then trying to buy an e-ticket in a cellphone dead spot, nervously watching the conductor moving down the aisle?  No ticket to show?  You’ll get whacked with a $2 surcharge.
Here are the optics:  Connecticut lawmakers short-change the CDOT budget, basically saying “let the commuters pick up the tab.”  Now MTA makes commuting less convenient with new ticket rules.
We all end up paying more and getting no improvement.  The trains are no faster or reliable… and maybe less attractive as a transportation choice.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Metro-North-shot-ephillips.jpg,,,2025-08-03 04:56:44.457753

Mike Dunleavy’s veto of more than $50 million in funding for Alaska’s K-12 schools.
As legislators were set to gavel in at 10 a.m., about a dozen protesters lined the hallways to advocate for legislators overriding the veto, with signs reading “vote like your kids live here,” “vote to override” and “fund public education!” 
One protester was Peter Sidmore, a middle school teacher in the Juneau School District, where he graduated in 2019.  
“It’s impressive how much the system in town has degraded in the six years since I graduated, just due to lack of funding. And I’ve been pretty present to see all of that, because we did have a fairly robust school system, and it’s really changed,” he said. 
Sidmore said that last year, the consolidation of Juneau’s two high schools was especially hard on students. This year, it’s the continued climate of uncertainty, he said. 
“That’s the hardest part. When we have a direction and we know what we’re getting, and we know what we can do, we can prepare students to an extent, but it’s the indecisiveness, it’s the back and forth that really, really is hard on students. Yeah, you hear that in education all the time. It’s just, you want to have a plan, even if it’s not the best,” Sidmore said.
McLain Sidmore, standing with him holding a sign, works for an education nonprofit in Juneau. “I see classes seem to be getting bigger every year,” McLain Sidmore said. “Teachers are being moved around until weeks into the school year; there are students not getting the services they need. And just parents are stressed. Kids are stressed. Teachers are stressed.”
Eric Antrim, an engineer with the U.S. Forest Service, as well as a member of the National Federation of Federal Employees, NFFE Local 251, held a sign reading “education is our future.” 
“I benefited from a public education growing up, and that was good enough to get me into engineering school and to perform well,” he said. “And I want our Legislature to act responsibly and pay it forward. They all benefited from safe schools and good schooling, and they shouldn’t be taking that away from the next generation.”
Debra Craig, a 43-year-resident of Juneau, said she worked in state government in social services. “So I have a fairly deep understanding of the challenges that people face when they don’t have adequate resources,” she said. “And education is like a fundamental resource that people need to be able to get ahead in the world, to be able to survive, to be able to just exist adequately.”
Craig said she’s concerned about the quality of education in Alaska, especially the lack of civics education and understanding of government. “Alaska is one of eight states that doesn’t require students graduating from high school to pass a civics test. And I think all of that is showing up throughout the United States in our national politics and our state politics,” she said. “So we need to support education. We need to support civics education so people understand what their government does, and doesn’t do for them.”
Outside the Capitol, a rally kicked off at 11 a.m with a crowd gathered to join a national day of action, and to support public education in Alaska. More than 300 demonstrations were set to take place on Saturday, part of a “Rage Against the Regime” protest against the Trump administration and threats to democracy, due process, and civil rights and freedoms. 
Speakers condemned the Trump administration’s actions on immigrant communities, public services and higher education, and they called for solidarity to continue protesting the president. 
“Public schools are democracy’s tools!” the crowd chanted. 
Just after 1:30 p.m., legislators voted to override two of the governor’s veto. A handful of demonstrators in the hall cheered senators after they left the house chambers.  
“It was great. We were very happy,” said Pat Race, a demonstrator who was standing outside the House doors. He’s a Juneau-based filmmaker and illustrator, and a product of Alaska schools. “There was a lot of clapping and then shushing of the clapping, because they were still working on things. But both veto overrides were a really big deal. And it was really nice to see them come through,” he said, referring to legislators also voting to override a veto of Senate Bill 183, a bill to require reports on oil tax settlements.
“And afterwards,” he added. “It was a sunny day in Juneau, and I fled the building for a celebratory taco.”
