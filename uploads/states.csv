Carlos Guillermo Smith stands near the crosswalk outside the Pulse memorial site in Orlando on Aug. 23, 2025. State workers had removed Gay Pride colors at the site, but activists used chalk to restore the colors. The state later repaved the site. (Via Smith's X feed)No doubt Gov. Ron DeSantis expects Floridians to be grateful for saving us from yet another woke attack on decency, probity, and speeding motorists.
I refer, of course, to colorful crosswalks.
Just as he has fought to expel books by Black and gay authors from our schools, the governor has ordered FDOT to paint over the flowers, the sunbursts, the fish, the musical notes, and the rainbows — especially the rainbows.
We want guns in our streets, not rainbows.
Speaking of guns, one of the first crosswalks to be destroyed was the one outside the Pulse Memorial.
You may recall that in 2016 a gunman murdered 49 people at an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando.
The rainbow crosswalk was intended to honor them.
DeSantis, however, views it as some sort of personal insult.
His political future looks distinctly unpromising AND his wife’s gubernatorial campaign lies in ruins after the Hope Florida scandal. Environmental activists won a temporary shutdown of his Everglades gulag, though an appeals court is allowing it to stay open for now.
I mean, nobody likes the guy, but, by God, he can still teach crosswalks a sharp lesson.
“We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes,” he said.
Except the crosswalks were not “commandeered.” Like most painted crosswalks in Florida, the Pulse rainbow was supported by the city government and the citizens.
FDOT itself had approved it.
But in late August, FDOT turned up in the dead of night and ground it off the road.
But this kind of pointless vandalism is happening across the state.
At least a dozen schools in Tampa will see their “Crosswalks to Classrooms” school crossings destroyed, including one painted to look like a shelf of books.
Florida’s government is particularly scared of books.
‘Political ideologies’
Hearts commemorating a young girl who died of a heart condition in Port St. Lucie; checkerboards in Daytona near the raceway; “Back the Blue” in Hillsborough County; bike lanes in Orange County, painted by kids who won an FDOT art contest to design them — all either already gone or about to be.
Florida Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue vows to “keep our transportation facilities free and clear of political ideologies.”
As if violating free expression in cities and towns across the state is not the product of a “political ideology.”
DeSantis says painted crosswalks promote “social, political, or ideological messages” and must be obliterated.
That’s one of his excuses. He’s got more.
The governor claims he has no choice but to enforce a new law — a law he signed — allowing FDOT to withhold funds for road projects and “traffic control” if cities and counties don’t follow orders.
Thing is, FDOT always had the power to forbid street art. That’s why communities wanting to paint a crosswalk sought and received permission — from FDOT.
Now, you could argue that the wrong kind of paint could create a slippery surface.
Crosswalk painters know this and generally use acrylic or other paints that bond to the asphalt.
You could argue brightly colored crosswalks give people trying to cross the street a false sense of security, leading them to just hop out into the road without looking to see what maniac in an F-150 is barreling toward them.
Except the data do not support that contention.
You could argue drivers encountering images of sunflowers or fish or “Black Lives Matter” on the road will be so discombobulated trying to read and interpret the art, they’ll become reckless.
Remember, FDOT said yes to those cheery, often clever, crosswalks.
Distracted drivers?
The crosswalks only got dangerous this spring.
Now, as the law says, “Non-standard surface markings, signage and signals that do not contribute directly to traffic safety or control can lead to distraction or misunderstandings, jeopardizing both driver and pedestrian safety.”
The state’s assumption that drivers aren’t already distracted is demonstrably false, as every human who has ever operated a car in this state knows.
Whether they’re behind the wheel of a beat-up Kia or 4,000-pound Mercedes SUV, people frequently struggle to heed FDOT’s “standard surface markings and signage,” including the scarlet octagon that says “STOP.”
Nevertheless, research indicates they are unlikely to lose control of the vehicle contemplating a pink, blue, and green-stiped crosswalk.
What they might do is slow the hell down. A national study shows street art has contributed to a 50% reduction in crashes involving vehicles and pedestrians.
In Leon County, the Knight Creative Communities Institute worked with Florida State University and local government to determine whether brightly painted crosswalks might get people to drive the speed limit near schools.
Sure enough, brightly painted crosswalks did indeed cause Tallahassee drivers — not noted for their adherence to posted speed limits — to ease up on the accelerator.
Unless you just moved to Florida from Inner Mongolia, you know what’s actually going on here.
Bike lanes and walkways designed and painted by school kids, and crosswalks celebrating a city’s history or its natural beauty or demonstrating its commitment to inclusivity, somehow threaten DeSantis’ commitment to Beijing-style state control.
Children must not grow up in the Free State Florida feeling free to create or express themselves or engage in their community.
‘Conform’
Asked during a press conference what he’d tell Florida children now watching grown people destroying their art, DeSantis said, “We have a representative system of government. People elect their representatives. They’re able to enact the legislation with the governor’s signature and then when that happens, obviously, people will conform their conduct accordingly.”
Hear that, kids? “Conform” your conduct and chant the mandated Pledge of Allegiance every morning.
DeSantis means to bully the people of this state from Perdido Bay to the Dry Tortugas: Expressions of dissent, assertions, of common humanity, civic pride, beauty, and joy will not be tolerated.
The people of Pensacola have been told the large “Black Lives Matter” painting on A Street, the words spelled out with flags of nations that have contributed to Florida culture, is verboten.
God forbid Black people think their lives matter.
This is not a popular decision: The mayor says Pensacola will comply, but city resources are stretched pretty thin, so if the state really wants to rid the place of a “Black Lives Matter” painting, FDOT might have to handle it themselves.
As for LGBTQ folks and their aggressive use of the color wheel, state policy is to erase both the pigmentation and the people.
Remove “gay” books from the library, pull courses out of college catalogs, and scrub rainbows off the streets.
Remember the great essay “The Cruelty is the Point” by Adam Serwer?
The Atlantic published it in the early days of Donald Trump’s first term, but it’s just as relevant now: insulting, attacking, undermining, performative hatred — this how the regimes in both Washington and Tallahassee rule us.
Resistance
Authoritarians want to control every aspect of our culture, no matter how seemingly inconsequential.
No shot is too cheap, no attack too petty: FDOT has just ripped out road signs on Longboat Key
The road signs identified Longboat Key’s main drag as “Gulf of Mexico Drive,” its name since 1957.
The regime wants it changed.
The entire world calls the body of water along Florida’s west coast the Gulf of Mexico.
However, I’m happy to report, not all Floridians acquiesce in this name-changing nonsense.
Some elderly residents of Tallahassee’s Westminster Oaks faced down a county road crew as it was scraping the paint off the yellow and green crosswalk by their retirement community.
Children at the nearby W.T. Moore Elementary School had painted it.
Around 30 seniors arrived on golf carts and walkers. An 85-year old lady lay down on the crosswalk and the road crew retreated.
But only temporarily.
Delray Beach and Key West are vigorously resisting DeSantis’ attempt to destroy their rainbow crosswalks, as is Fort Lauderdale, which is demanding an FDOT hearing.
Fort Lauderdale’s mayor declared, “We must stand our ground. We cannot allow us to be bullied into submission and to allow others to dictate what we should do in our own communities.”
In Orlando, the resistance grows louder and more determined.
After the state wrecked the Pulse rainbow crosswalk, hundreds of protesters re-colored the rainbow.
FDOT painted the new rainbow black.
Protesters colored it in again.
FDOT put up signs saying, “No Impeding Traffic,” and, “Defacing Roadway Prohibited,” and called in city cops and the Highway Patrol.
You’d think they’d be lurking in a Home Depot parking lot rounding up Brown people. At least four people have been arrested.
They were armed — with water-soluble chalk.
Babysitters
I’d be willing to bet these law enforcement officers signed up to fight crime, bust bad guys, and keep communities safe, not protect a 10-foot wide hunk of road.
One man, a survivor of the Pulse nightclub massacre, observed on social media: “More officers babysitting the crosswalk than there were security guards watching the front door of Pulse the night 49 people were murdered. By a lot.”
Our tax dollars at work.
I have news for Ron DeSantis and the dead-eyed myrmidons who carry out his narrow-minded whims: You can’t pray the gay away, nor can you paint over it.
You can’t quash children’s creativity.
You can’t surgically remove people of color from our history.
You can’t outlaw rainbows.
Just as FSU’s football team was putting the finishing flourishes on its win over the Alabama Crimson Tide, the sun came out. To the west, a glorious rainbow arced across the Tallahassee sky.
I’m waiting for DeSantis to declare the heavens “woke.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-08 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA’s reconsideration of the asbestos ban compromises CT veterans,Christina Johnson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/08/epas-reconsideration-of-the-asbestos-ban-compromises-ct-veterans/,"One truth impossible to ignore: unless asbestos exposure is eliminated once and for all, the human cost —especially among veterans— will only escalate.","Asbestos is not just a relic of America’s industrial past —it is a continuing threat that has etched a deep and disconcerting mark on thousands of veterans across Connecticut and the country. 
Previously celebrated for its versatility, this natural mineral was widely incorporated into almost all military infrastructure during much of the 20th century. Likewise, ships constructed before 2002 were also packed with asbestos in their engine and boiler rooms and other areas that needed heat and chemical protection. This extensive use resulted in the asbestos exposure of shipyard workers involved in the construction and maintenance of these vessels. Similarly, Navy veterans’ asbestos exposure also occurred as they both lived and worked in an environment surrounded by asbestos products. 
It took a long time for science to discover that this mineral’s tiny fibers could cause lethal diseases, such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer.
Recognizing these dangers, federal regulators began moving toward restrictions as early as 1989, when the country’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attempted to phase out most asbestos-containing goods. The last mining operation of this mineral also stopped eventually in 2002. Yet such efforts were only partially successful as chrysotile —the most commonly used form— remains legal, allowing various industries to import and use it in their products. That gap remained a glaring weakness in public health protection until 2024, when the EPA finally prohibited the use of this asbestos, closing one of the last cracks that allowed the material into the country.


But just as a significant stride was achieved, the agency shockingly announced in June 2025 that it would reconsider the chrysotile ban after several chemical manufacturers filed a petition questioning the rule. Rather than standing firm on this hard-won policy, authorities opted to reassess it —a process that could drag on for as long as 30 months. In a troubling twist, the agency also asked the court to pause ongoing litigation related to the matter. 
For veterans and their families already enduring the devastating health repercussions of asbestos exposure, these choices represent far more than a bureaucratic delay. Furthermore, the ban rollback also poses an alarming risk to public health and safety, potentially reintroducing this toxic mineral back into federal and military supply chains.
How asbestos exposure impacted veterans in Connecticut
Asbestos exposure has long been a troubling issue affecting all 50 states nationwide, including Connecticut. An updated interactive map showed that between 1999 and 2017, the Constitution State saw at least 3,865 related deaths, which emphasizes a devastating impact on a coastal state that hosts over 131,600 veterans. Of these, 2,860 were attributed to lung cancer, while asbestosis and mesothelioma, respectively, accounted for 314 and 715 cases. Among the hardest hit regions was Hartford County—which reported about 804 fatalities —followed closely by New Haven County with an alarming 802 deaths.
A large share of these victims were former service members who spent an extended period in contaminated bases like Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton. Nationally, veterans make up about a third of the 3,000 mesothelioma diagnoses logged annually, despite representing only 6.1% of the entire adult population. This disproportionate burden makes one truth impossible to ignore: unless asbestos exposure is eliminated once and for all, the human cost—especially among veterans—will only escalate.
Protecting the veterans means upholding the asbestos ban
The federal government has made meaningful progress in acknowledging toxic exposure in military service. One result is the ratification of the Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, which expanded healthcare and disability benefits for veterans suffering from service-connected conditions, including those caused by asbestos. Yet the logic of such reforms sadly becomes meaningless if, at the same time, policymakers allow the hazardous mineral to creep back into supply chains.
The 2024 chrysotile asbestos ban was the product of decades of science and public pressure converging on a single conclusion —that this natural mineral is dangerous. As such, reconsidering that decision not only undermines trust in public health protections but also places veterans and their families back in harm’s way. And for those already fighting asbestos-related illnesses, the mere possibility of weakening the rule already feels like a profound betrayal.  
Moreover, future service members deserve the assurance that they will be shielded from what’s supposed to be a preventable danger. With this, maintaining the asbestos ban is even more essential to ensuring that the invaluable contributions of those who sacrifice so much for our country are not only remembered, but actively honored.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, criticized U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, at a campaign event for her 3rd Congressional District run Sunday, for not holding public town halls.
Trone Garriott held a town hall event at Big Grove Brewery in Des Moines, where she answered questions from the crowd about issues like cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, made through the GOP-backed budget reconciliation bill. She also spoke about nitrate levels in Iowa waters, voting rights and immigration law enforcement.
Trone Garriott, who is running for the 3rd Congressional District in the 2026 election, said the district needs a representative who will listen to these concerns and engage constituents who have differing views.

“Our congressman, Zach Nunn, has not been showing up for people,” Trone Garriott said. “Since he started four years ago, he has not held a single open town hall. Responding to concerns that he wasn’t holding town halls, he said that it would be a waste of taxpayer money to do so — that it would be a ‘taxpayer-funded protest.’ Now, if people are showing up angry, it’s even more important that their voices are heard, because there’s a problem.”
Trone Garriott had referenced a Des Moines Register interview with Nunn in August, where the representative said he regularly holds public events, but that “we’re not going to do what the Democratic groups want us to do and just host a taxpayer-funded protest event.”
Holding public town halls has been a point of contention for Republicans as they face backlash from some constituents regarding controversial decisions made by Republicans in Congress, and the Trump administration, such as cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and to the U.S. Departments of Veteran Affairs and Education.
Nunn’s campaign manager, Brendan Duffy, said in a statement to the Iowa Capital Dispatch that the representative is “consistently accessible to Iowans, holding hundreds of events in all 21 counties and hosting real listening sessions that deliver real results.”






“Congressman Nunn isn’t going to take advice on meeting with his constituents from far-left activists who are out of touch with Iowa values,” Duffy said. “Zach Nunn has delivered $11,000 in tax cuts for Iowa families, $60 billion in direct assistance for farmers, and $50 billion for rural hospitals. While Democrat activists lie to Iowans, Congressman Nunn will continue delivering for them.”






The Iowa Republican’s congressional website states he has held 129 mobile office hours, 304 events with Iowans and provided 120,676 answers to Iowans.
Trone Garriott said that during her time as a state legislator, she has made an effort to reach out to voters of all backgrounds through public events and efforts to engage the community. She said “that’s why I am a Democratic senator representing a Republican district — because people appreciate someone who’s going to work hard for them, care about them, show up for them.”
The Democratic state senator was first elected in 2020, defeating Republican Scott Cirksena. In 2022, she won against then-Senate President Jake Chapman to represent Senate District 14 after redistricting, and won a close reelection race in 2024. Trone Garriott said she would bring her experience from these elections to the race against Nunn, and continue that work in Washington.
“We’re not getting the results we need, we’re not getting the decisions that we need, and we’re not getting our voices represented in Washington,” Trone Garriott said. “We need elected leaders who will show up. We need folks who aren’t afraid to come gather with the community and show up and listen and learn from what is on the minds and hearts of our members of the community, and so that’s why I’m running for Congress.”
Former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst is also running to become the Democratic nominee for the seat.
In an interview with reporters following the event, Trone Garriott said if elected, she would have office hours or other time scheduled where constituents can come in to speak about their concerns with her or staff members.
“I think that’s incredibly important for any community leader to make sure getting your time in with your constituents — and not just the ones that you’re seeking out, but the ones who won’t come to you,” Trone Garriott said.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — Jerry Schmitz is rarely at a loss for words about soybeans.
But when asked if farmers have faith in a good outcome from the Trump administration’s trade standoff with China, his gaze shifted and his brow creased momentarily as he thought about the best way to answer.
“Hope might be the better word over faith,” he said.
Schmitz, of rural Vermillion, is the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association and the South Dakota Soybean Checkoff. A checkoff is a fee that’s collected from soybean sales and used for research and promotion of the crop.
South Dakota governor’s economic advisers bemoan Trump’s tariff policy

During and after a roundtable discussion Saturday at the Central States Fairgrounds hosted by a nonprofit called Farmers for Free Trade, Schmitz expressed concerns about the effects of trade disputes on farmers.
About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said. China imports soybeans largely for livestock feed to meet the growing demand for meat among its 1.4 billion people.
Now the country is boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs on Chinese goods imposed recently by Republican President Donald Trump.
“There is not a bushel sold to China right now, and we’re about to harvest,” Schmitz said.
Trump has said he’s wielding tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a negotiating tool to correct trade imbalances with other countries.
The Chinese boycott has reduced demand for U.S. soybeans, which has influenced prices. Soybeans sold for about $10.50 per bushel one year ago in South Dakota, but are now $1 to $1.50 lower, and there are fears of further declines without a China trade deal.
Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective. Noting that South Dakota farmers raise nearly 250 million bushels of soybeans annually, he said a price drop of $2 per bushel translates to a loss of $500 million.

Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.
“We need a deal sooner rather than later,” Johnson said, “because there is not an unlimited ability in farm country to be able to weather the storm.”
Johnson and Schmitz said farmers are planning to store some of the soybeans they’ll harvest this fall, in hopes of selling later at a higher price. Schmitz said grain elevators and soybean processors lacking buyers might have to store excess beans on the ground outside their facilities.
Both also stressed the long-term importance of finding additional buyers for U.S. soybeans. That could include developing better trade relationships with countries that have large populations and growing economies, such as India.
It could also include capitalizing on new domestic markets, such as the possibility of converting soybean oil into sustainable aviation fuel. A $500 million processing plant that will open this fall in Mitchell, for example, will process soybeans and other oilseed crops for uses in renewable fuel, food, livestock feed, lubricants and more.
Those efforts could reduce dependence on Chinese demand but aren’t likely to wholly replace it.
“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.

The congressman said many of the farmers he meets are “still backing the president’s play” to use tariffs in negotiations that could benefit agriculture in the future, but he said high tariffs “cannot be business as usual on a go-forward basis.”
“The president’s trying to use them as a tool to get better deals,” Johnson said. “I understand that approach, but we do not want to just end with high tariffs.”
The roundtable organizer, Farmers for Free Trade, is on a 14-state tour in an RV wrapped with pro-trade messaging. The group advocates for open markets and reduced trade barriers, said its executive director, Brian Kuehl, of Wyoming.
He referenced a statistic indicating exports account for 20% of the value of U.S. agricultural production.
“So if you were to lose all your exports, you’re going to lose farms, and you’re going to lose farmers. You’re going to lose rural America and rural communities,” Kuehl said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2788-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-07 15:56:30.893626

Wes Moore was back on a national Sunday talk show -- his third in as many weeks -- again denying that he is running for president and pushing back against President Donald Trump's threat to send federal troops into Baltimore to fight crime.,"Gov. Wes Moore on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, when he talked about the economy, the president's threat to send federal troops into Baltimore and -- again -- his electoral plans. (Screengrab of NBC video)For a man who’s not running for president, Gov. Wes Moore sure has been making the rounds of the national Sunday talk shows recently. But there’s also been plenty to talk about, from vaccines to federal troop deployments.
Moore, appearing Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” would not say he would “completely rule it out,” when asked about a presidential bit, but he did repeat his oft-stated assertion that he is not running for president in 2028, and is focused instead on seeking reelection next year as governor of Maryland.
“I’ll be serving a full term. I’m excited about reelection. I’m excited about what I’m going to be able to do for the people of Maryland,” he said in response to a question from moderator Kristen Welker, before reciting a list of his administration’s accomplishments..
It was similar to the discussion he had two weeks earlier on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” when he volunteered that he is not running for president during a discussion of President Donald Trump saying Moore is not “presidential timber.” Moore’s residential aspirations did not come up on last week’s “This Week” on ABC — but he wasn’t directly asked about it.
What Moore has been asked about in each appearance was the president’s threat to send troops into Baltimore, among other cities, to respond to crime there.
Moore orders state police to assist Baltimore cops in crime reduction efforts

Moore — who on Friday announced a surge of Maryland State Police into the city to help further bring down crime rates — repeated his charge that Trump’s proposal would be “performative” and ineffective. He said Guard members are not trained for law enforcement and noted that those deployed last month to Washington, D.C., have been reduced in some instances to raking mulch and picking up trash, at what he said is an estimated cost of $1 million a day.
“You know, the president’s proposed budget actually cuts supports for the FBI and ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] bureaus, which are things we actually could use,” Moore said. “When you’re looking at the Big Beautiful Bill, it actually cuts $30 million of funding for violence prevention programs that are happening in the city of Baltimore and across the state of Maryland.”
Trump has said that the presence of federal troops has led to a drop in crimes that have made the District a “safe zone.” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has said that crime was already at historic lows already, but she recently credited the presence of federal troops with a further drop in crimes.
Moore acknowledged that crime is down in D.C., but said it has fallen just as fast, or faster, in Baltimore during the same time frame without federal intervention.
“If you’re looking at the same time period of this D.C. occupation … if you look at assaults with a deadly weapon, they’ve actually increased in D.C. by 8%; in Baltimore, have decreased by 10%,” he said. “And on every other major indicator, from homicide, to carjacking, you could say that Baltimore has actually had the same type of drop as Washington D.C. has had during this period. And we didn’t mobilize the National Guard for it.”
What Moore did do was announce plans Friday for a “renewed collaboration” between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police.
“We are proud of the progress that we’ve been able to make, and we’re all very, very concerned about how much work still needs to happen,” Moore said at the time, flanked by Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and city and state police officials. “If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that is one too many.”

(Photo by Dan Gross/Courtesy Miranda Spivack)Miranda Spivack is a familiar name in these parts. She’s a former Washington Post editor and reporter who covered Maryland politics, personalities, planning and perfidy, particularly in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, for 20 years. She was a top editor at the late, lamented Gazette Newspapers during its heady heyday in the 1990s, as it expanded from Montgomery County into Frederick, Prince George’s, and eventually, Southern Maryland.
She had a distinguished career as a national political and legal reporter before that. More recently, she has become a fierce advocate for open government and has mentored young journalists both internationally and in the U.S.
And – point of personal privilege – Miranda is the person who brought me to Maryland, hiring me in late 1995 to cover the State House for the Gazette. It’s fair to say that she’s had a lot to do with my own career trajectory over the past three decades.
Miranda recently published a book that is both fascinating and utterly sobering. It serves as a pointed reminder that while we’re forced to digest a firehose of crazy and unsettling news from the federal government, every single hour of every day, we cannot lose sight of what our state and local governments are doing – and what they’re not doing.

Miranda and I will be discussing her book, “Backroom Deals in Our Backyards: How Government Secrecy Harms Our Communities and the Local Heroes Fighting Back,” (published by The New Press), at 6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 9, at the invaluable People’s Book in Takoma Park. It’s one of many appearances she’s making around the country since her book was published in late spring – with more on tap.
“Backroom Deals in Our Backyards” is a look at the efforts of local and state governments to suppress vital information about public health and public safety, often in cahoots with big corporations – and the homegrown, accidental whistleblowers who strived to expose them and sound the alarm for their neighbors.
These are heroes in every sense of the word. Miranda tells five stories: One is about “forever chemicals” poisoning the water supply in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. Another is about a perpetually faulty sewer system in the “Black Belt” of Alabama. Another describes the protective uniforms coated by toxic chemicals that firefighters often wear. Another – the most chilling, in certain ways – reveals the secret algorithms that states often use to determine which incarcerated individuals can receive parole.
And Miranda recounts an episode that received a fair amount of attention in Maryland a few years ago, when parents at a high school in Bethesda tried desperately to pry safety studies from state officials about a dangerous intersection near the school on River Road. Only after a fatal crash at the intersection did the state begin to make data available and respond to residents’ cries for a traffic light.
The resistance these citizen activists encountered was sometimes bureaucratic and sometimes political – or a combination of the two. But the information they eventually were able to publicize was essential to the well-being of their communities, and brought about meaningful change.
In addition to these compelling stories, Miranda in the book lays out tips and resources for community activists looking for help in unearthing documents and other information that the government is withholding. It’s a valuable primer because so often whistleblowers are everyday citizens who don’t really know how to become activists and take on powerful interests.
Miranda and I will be talking about all her great reporting on Sept. 9. And because we’ve both spent a lot of time thinking about – and fighting against – the sharp decline in local news, I suspect that will be a topic as well. Chances are, some of these local governments wouldn’t have been able to suppress information from their citizenry if there had been robust media coverage of their day-to-day activities.
So come join Miranda and me for what is sure to be a lively and revealing conversation. People’s Book is at 7014-A Westmoreland Ave. in Takoma Park. If you can’t catch us there on Tuesday, Miranda will also be discussing her book on Sept. 10, at 7 p.m., at Redeemer Church in Bethesda. There will probably be additional appearances in the region in the future.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240908MirandaSpivack0031-cropped-e1757265645380-1024x703.jpeg,,,2025-09-07 13:56:43.976977

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST PETERSBURG- A crowd of around 75 people gathered in St. Petersburg on Saturday to strategize ways to persuade the police chiefs of Tampa and St. Petersburg to void partnership agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they entered into earlier this year.
Legislation signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis requires that sheriffs or chief correctional officers operating a county detention facility must enter into a 287(g) agreement with ICE. That means that every county sheriff in the state needed to sign such an agreement this year, which they all have.
There is no requirement for municipalities to do the same, yet hundreds of police departments throughout the state have done so anyway. In the cases of Tampa and St. Petersburg, two of the largest cities in the state, those agreements were reached quietly earlier this year, without fanfare.
Now activists in the area say that they intend to persuade Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw and St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway to cancel such agreements.
“In order to foster public trust and a positive relationship with the community, we ask you to cancel this heartless, inefficient 287(g) agreement before further harm is done,” read the form letters that attendees at the Allendale United Methodist Church in St. Petersburg were asked to send on Saturday to Bercaw and Holloway, as well as Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch. The letters were accessed through a QR code listed on pamphlets distributed by organizers at the event.
Threats to be removed from office
Addressing the crowd, activist Karla Correa showed a picture of Florida Attorney James Uthmeier, who has threatened to remove city council members who have shown inclination not to sign such agreements.

“He’s saying, no, you have to do it or else I’m going to remove you from office,” said Correa, with the Tampa Bay area chapter of the Party of Socialism and Liberation.
“He is the attorney general for the state of Florida. He has a lot of power. And he’s going along with Ron DeSantis’ agenda, and we see whenever anyone tries to fight against it, again, they threaten to remove them from office. That’s what happened in Orlando. That’s what happened in Key West. That’s what happened in Fort Myers.”
The Key West City Commission voided its police department’s 287(g) after learning that their police chief had signed such an agreement without commissioners’ knowledge. After they did that, Uthmeier publicly declared that the action had made Key West a “sanctuary city,” which is banned in Florida law. Shortly thereafter, the commission reconvened and approved a new 287(g) agreement on a 4-2 vote.
A similar situation happened with the Pinellas County School District earlier this year, with the school superintendent and the school board apparently unaware that their chief of police had signed an agreement. Once that news was made public, the district backed away from the agreement.
“Did anyone know that Pinellas County schools signed a 287(g) agreement for a second?” Correa asked members of the crowd. “Because ICE shouldn’t be in schools. But you know what happened right after? There was a huge public outcry, right? Parents came out. Teachers came out. Community members who don’t even have kids came out to fight against this and to oppose it. And you know what they did? And you won’t hear DeSantis talk about this. They voided that agreement,” she said to cheers in the audience.
In addition to asking the mayors and police chiefs of the two cities to use their authority to cancel the agreements, the activists are calling on the St. Petersburg and Tampa city councils to pass resolutions condemning the 287(g) agreements. And they want the Tampa Human Rights Board to “begin an immediate and thorough investigation of Tampa PD’s 287(g) partnership.”
SPPD responds
St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway provided a written statement to the Phoenix later on Saturday.
“To clarify, our department is not part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” he said. “We assist ICE only when, during the course of a lawful encounter, an individual is identified as a suspect or subject in a criminal investigation. If it is determined that the individual has an active warrant, we are legally obligated to execute that warrant, whether it’s ICE-related or not, fairly and consistently. We are not seeking, nor do we receive, funding to support ICE operations.”
Attorneys representing the state have informed a judge in a lawsuit filed by the city of South Miami regarding the confusion about the law that, in fact, municipalities in Florida are not required to sign such an agreement.
The Tampa Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oct. 5, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A Nebraska state senator is taking the first steps toward pursuing impeachment proceedings against a University of Nebraska regent charged with driving drunk in a crash that caused serious injuries.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha confirmed Examiner reporting that she is exploring what the Nebraska Legislature needs to do to consider articles of impeachment against NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha.
Kauth confirmed Saturday that she has discussed her plans with the Governor’s Office and top legislative leadership.
“This is such a grotesque abuse of public trust that it needs to be addressed,” Kauth told the Nebraska Examiner on Saturday. 
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area. April 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, who served as an NU regent between 2013 and 2023, including four years with O’Connor, told the Examiner that the charges against her are “extremely serious” while noting she remains innocent until proven guilty.
“If she knows the allegations against her to be true, I urge her to reflect on whether she should remain in a position of public trust,” Pillen said in a statement. “In any event, the question of impeachment is entrusted by our Constitution to the Legislature, and I respect the judgment of that body on this matter.”
‘Willing to start the proceedings’
Kauth is expected to announce her plans Sunday in her regular email to her constituents and supporters. Kauth is an influential lawmaker and committee chair, and her push marks the first legislative move toward removing O’Connor from office. Only the Legislature can do so if O’Connor doesn’t resign.
Authorities allege that O’Connor had a blood alcohol concentration of four times the legal limit, or 0.321%, at the time of a May 21 crash in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood in O’Connor’s district.

Kauth noted that a criminal trial could take time to resolve and said the Legislature should act now because lawmakers do not condone what O’Connor’s alleged actions. Kauth said no one is above the law and that elected officials must be held to the highest standards.
Kauth added she is “appalled” that O’Connor has not resigned or made any indication she would resign for allegations Kauth called “absolutely inexcusable.” The senator called resigning the “honorable choice.”
“I’m willing to start the proceedings so we can make sure that at some point in time she is no longer representing the university,” Kauth said.
Impact of a felony charge
O’Connor, reelected in November to a second six-year term, has pleaded not guilty. Neither O’Connor nor her attorney had an immediate comment Saturday.
“My attorney has advised me of my rights, including the right to a jury trial; my right to confront accusers; to subpoena witnesses; to remain silent; to counsel; … and my right to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” O’Connor said in a May 28 filing in Douglas County District Court.
NU regent faces felony DUI charge from crash that could jeopardize her office

O’Connor, 35, is charged with one Class IIIA felony alleging that she drove under the influence and caused serious injury. A passenger in the opposing car suffered a broken back and pelvis, according to police and court records. Four others were in that car, including three young children. Both cars were totaled.
The father of the children injured in the crash started an online petition in recent weeks calling for O’Connor to lose her law license and resign as a regent after details of the case became public. As of Saturday, the petition had gathered nearly 800 signatures.
“These actions will not only hold her accountable but also serve as a firm reminder that such behavior is unacceptable for someone in her position,” the petition states.
Prosecutors filed charges against O’Connor July 30. Investigators transferred the case from the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, which normally handles felony charges, to the Omaha City Prosecutor’s Office because O’Connor, until early August, had worked as a deputy county attorney.
Impact of a felony
O’Connor and her attorney have yet to publicly discuss her fate as a regent. She has continued attending board meetings, including in June to approve the university’s budget. 
NU campuses are considering more than $40 million in cuts. Regents are set to vote on the reductions package by the end of the year.

Under the Nebraska Constitution, someone convicted of a felony cannot hold public office. Constitutional officers can only be removed from office via legislative impeachment if they don’t resign.
If the Legislature impeaches O’Connor or she resigns, Pillen would choose her successor.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista had no immediate comment.
Impeachment steps
The Legislature can impeach an officeholder via a legislative resolution, which can be brought during a regular or special session. In the past, such resolutions have always followed a legislative investigation.
Past investigations have followed the formation of a special investigatory committee, a designated group of lawmakers who would investigate the incident and recommend whether to impeach a state official. Legislative rules require such a committee to be established during a legislative session, yet the committee could work only while lawmakers are out of session.
Lawmakers adjourned in June for the year and are not set to return until January.

Another option: An existing legislative committee with jurisdiction — possibly the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee — could hold a public hearing on whether to pursue a legislative investigation. Both approaches could have subpoena power.
It would take 25 legislative votes to impeach, a simple majority. Nothing would prevent Kauth or another lawmaker from pursuing a vote for impeachment without first pursuing an investigation, but the Nebraska Supreme Court requires “clear and convincing” legislative evidence to convict on articles of impeachment.
Nebraska’s 49-member Legislature, which is officially nonpartisan, has 33 registered Republicans, 15 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive.
If the Legislature impeaches a state official, that person is barred from performing official duties until the state’s high court weighs in. At least five of seven justices would need to agree.
The Nebraska Legislature last impeached a state official in 2006. Lawmakers passed 10 articles of impeachment against then-NU Regent C. David Hergert related to alleged campaign finance violations by a 25-22 vote. Six Supreme Court justices convicted Hergert, removing and disqualifying him from public office.
‘Second chances’
O’Connor was elected in 2018 as the youngest regent ever, at 28 years old, and as one of just a handful of women to serve. She is a former University of Nebraska at Omaha student regent.
Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha has defended O’Connor, saying the regent “takes responsibility for making a bad choice, but she’s also doing everything she can to make it right.” Weitz has described O’Connor as an “outstanding” regent who has NU’s best interests in mind.
“Of all the people I know who deserve second chances, she tops the list,” Weitz said previously.

The NU Board of Regents is officially nonpartisan but consists of 6 registered Republicans and 2 Democrats. Weitz and O’Connor are Democrats. Kauth and Pillen are Republicans.
Regents most often vote as one, and over the past seven years, across hundreds of votes, the board split 6-2 along party lines once. That was in April, when the regents amended NU bylaws to try to comply with an order from President Donald Trump’s administration against higher education diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Weitz and O’Connor opposed the changes.
Message of continued service
Kauth said O’Connor’s continued service risks an appearance that elected officials get a “free pass.” She said she is also concerned about the message to college students, that if they get drunk, “blitzed out of your mind and nearly kill someone” it could be seen as “no big deal.”
She said no state lawmaker believes a drunken driver should have more rights than injured victims facing a “cascading effect” of trauma, Kauth said. The senator said she would call for a Republican to resign if facing similar charges.
“Everyone has hard times,” Kauth said. “It does not excuse anyone from drinking and getting in a car, period.”

ONEONTA — The names echoed down the halls of the Blount County courthouse Thursday morning like a child’s game of telephone.
“Darlene?”
One of the county commissioners was reading from a list of those who’d asked to speak at a public meeting concerning the potential approval of a medical waste treatment facility in nearby Remlap.
“Darlene,” a resident at the back of the room repeated to those outside. Community members opposed to the new facility, proposed by Harvest Med Waste Disposal, wouldn’t all fit in the boardroom where commission meetings are typically held. They also lined the hallways of the courthouse nearly to the building’s exit. One court employee said they’d never seen the facility packed with as many citizens. The woman’s name continued down the line.

“Darlene,” someone further outside repeated. “Darlene,” a final resident echoed.
One by one, community members from all walks of life—business owners, environmentalists, nurses, college professors, healthcare experts and retirees—made their way to the podium to tell their local elected officials in no uncertain terms: Remlap, Alabama, population 2,500, isn’t a dumping ground.
Those living and working in and around Remlap, about 20 miles northeast of Birmingham, have rallied in opposition to Harvest Med Waste Disposal’s proposed medical waste processing facility on Highway 75, a stone’s throw from the Jefferson County line. The enterprise, to be housed in a former tire shop, would sit just feet from Gurley Creek, part of the Black Warrior River watershed, and is located within a FEMA-designated flood zone, according to government documents.

Residents have been vocal in opposing the facility opening in Remlap, citing environmental and safety concerns. David Dyer, owner of Harvest Med Waste, has said many community members’ concerns are unwarranted. His company, he argued at Thursday’s commission meeting, will provide needed jobs in Blount County and bring a safe, environmentally friendly technology—ozone sterilization of medical waste—to Alabama for the first time.
While supporters at Thursday’s meeting included only Dyer’s lawyers, friends and business associates, Blount County residents have found themselves the targets of paid social media advertising in support of Harvest Med Waste, though it’s unclear who is behind the online campaign.
Both Dyer and a representative of Clean Waste Systems, a national company responsible for the sterilization technology Dyer’s facility plans to use, denied involvement with the advertising to an Inside Climate News reporter on Thursday.
“I’m not even on social media,” Dyer said.

Mountains of medical waste

Medical waste management is a more than $2 billion industry in the U.S., according to market analysts, and is projected to grow to over $3 billion by 2030. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that U.S. health care providers generate more than 3 million tons of such waste each year, including everything from used syringes and gauze to contaminated gloves and other personal protective equipment.
All that waste must go somewhere. Historically, incineration has been the primary method of disposal. More than 90 percent of potentially infectious medical waste was incinerated before 1997, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Since that time, other technologies have helped fill the need for medical waste disposal, including the use of autoclaves—machines that use pressurized steam to treat waste—and other sterilization technologies.
In the last decade, ozone sterilization has also become a growing technology, with proponents arguing that the method provides an environmentally friendly alternative to incineration, for example.
Clean Waste Systems, based in Maple Lake, Minnesota, is slated to provide the ozone sterilization technology for Dyer’s Remlap facility, pending its approval. The company uses a technology called “humidizone” to sterilize shredded medical waste, which can then be trucked to a run-of-the-mill landfill for disposal.
Kelly Prchal, CEO of Clean Waste Systems, was one of the handful of supporters of the project to speak during Thursday’s meeting.
“I want to clarify some misinformation,” Prchal told commissioners. Residents in the audience groaned. “Our system is fully enclosed, contained and designed to meet and exceed all federal and state environmental standards,” she said.
Many of the concerns expressed on Thursday weren’t about the sterilization process itself, but instead involved the location of the facility and the risks imposed by trucking of medical waste material into and out of Remlap.

Warren Allworth, a nearby resident who moved to the area from South Africa, cited frequent traffic accidents in the area as a concern.
“Anyone who’s ever driven in Alabama knows that people don’t know how to drive,” he said. The audience laughed. “I love y’all, but it’s the truth.”
When there was a recent traffic accident at the Dollar General across from the proposed site, he said, the truck involved remained in the ditch for days before it was removed.
“I dread the day it’s one of his trucks,” Allworth said, referring to Dyer.
Dale Spain, another resident, lives a few hundred yards from the development site along Gurley Creek. He’s now retired, having worked for UPS for more than 40 years. During that time, he said, he witnessed many, large scale accidents that left hazardous materials scattered along roadways.
“If there is an accident, which there will be, you’re putting all of the first responders at risk, all of the bystanders, all of the people trying to help. And if it’s a bad wreck, this stuff will be scattered everywhere, and they’ll have no clue how to deal with it. Bringing that in and through Blount County isn’t the right place to go.”
Paul Gilbert, who serves as chief of Remlap Fire and EMS, would be one of the first to respond if an accident involving a truck with medical waste were to occur. He said his greatest concern is the sheer amount of potentially hazardous material involved.
“They can do 400 pounds of medical waste an hour,” he said. “If you work an eight-hour shift, that’s 3,200 pounds of biohazardous medical waste. If you work a 40-hour week, that’s 16,000 pounds of biohazardous medical waste.”
Jim Braziel, an associate professor of English at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who lives in Remlap, put it simply: “We don’t want to be a dump for the surrounding counties,” he said. “We don’t want to be the processor for these materials for the surrounding counties or the state of Alabama or the world.”
Braziel and his wife, Tina Mozelle Braziel, a renowned poet who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting, built a glass cabin in Blount County by hand and wrote a book about the process.
At the end of his comments Thursday, Braziel addressed Dyer directly.
“We don’t want your facility here,” he said. “So why do you want to come here? Go somewhere else.”
Residents and environmental groups have also said that the facility’s location aside Gurley Creek, in a flood zone, poses unnecessary risks.
“An individual from Birmingham is planning to put a medical waste processing facility in South Blount County,” an environmental nonprofit, Friends of the Locust Fork River, said in a statement ahead of Thursday’s meeting. “The waste is billed as non-hazardous in the application for permit, but FLFR believes that medical waste picked up at hospitals, doctor’s offices, etc. and transported to Remlap is hazardous waste…a bio-hazard.”
Locating the processing facility next to Gurley Creek, then, puts the watershed at risk, the nonprofit argued.
“If a catastrophic flood should occur affecting the facility, the endangered Flattened Musk Turtle and Black Warrior Waterdog habitat could be greatly altered in a negative way,” the nonprofit’s statement went on. “If toxic waste enters the creek, the threatened Gurley Darter found only in that creek would be wiped off the face of the earth forever. FLFR believes the facility location is a stage for an accident waiting to happen.”
In his comments during the meeting, Dyer dismissed concerns about potential harm to the environment.
“The creek’s a non-issue,” Dyer said. “Why in the world would I invest millions of dollars if I was worried about flooding a creek where I’d be sued to the end of time and probably put in prison if I was dumping into a creek?”

An online mystery

Thursday’s county commission meeting hasn’t been the only venue for debate over the Remlap facility. An online petition opposing the facility has garnered hundreds of signatures, and residents have said they’ve been subjected to constant online advertising advocating for the business.
A Facebook page called “Blount County for Safe Waste Solutions” has run multiple paid advertisements related to the project and the underlying technology, according to records reviewed by Inside Climate News.
The page, launched in August, has run at least three paid advertisements in the days leading up to Thursday’s meeting.
“Being a good neighbor always matters. That’s why Clean Waste Systems are small, safe, and designed to blend right in with the community or facility in which they’re located,” one paid post said, in part. “People living or working nearby ozone processing facilities often don’t even know the system is operating, but they feel the benefit of cleaner, safer, sustainable waste management through a smaller carbon footprint.”
According to Facebook records, the person or group responsible for the page hasn’t yet completed the company’s identity verification process. A message sent to the page by an Inside Climate News reporter went unanswered.
Both Dyer and Prchal denied any involvement with the online advertising on Thursday.

‘We will fight’

After Thursday’s meeting, Mike D’Angelo, a local business owner, sat outside his business, located just a few yards from Gurley Creek and the proposed facility. He’s lived in Remlap for more than 50 years. For him, preventing the new development is about protecting a waterway that’s been a part of his life for decades. He said he’s watched the area flood many times over the years, with Gurley Creek’s waters lapping at the walls of the proposed treatment facility, which is visible from his business’ front door.
“My grandchildren play in that creek,” he said Thursday morning. “I’d like to keep it clean so they can continue to.”
D’Angelo and other residents present at the meeting said they don’t plan to back down in their opposition to the project, regardless of the commission’s ultimate decision when they vote on Oct. 2.
“We’re not going anywhere,” he said, his eyes glancing over at Gurley Creek. “We will fight.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blount-County-Commission-for-Sept-7-2025-story-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-07 08:57:22.504231

But still undercovered in the 20th anniversary saga of the storm that made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, and caused unprecedented destruction is the role that a worm farmer from northeast Mississippi played in helping to revitalize the Coast.
House Speaker Billy McCoy, who died in 2019, was a worm farmer from the Prentiss, not Alcorn County, side of Rienzi — about as far away from the Gulf Coast as one could be in Mississippi.
McCoy grew other crops, but a staple of his operations was worm farming. 
Early after the storm, the House speaker made a point of touring the Coast and visiting as many of the House members who lived on the Coast as he could to check on them.
But it was his action in the forum he loved the most — the Mississippi House — that is credited with being key to the Coast’s recovery.
Gov. Haley Barbour had called a special session about a month after the storm to take up multiple issues related to Katrina and the Gulf Coast’s survival and revitalization. The issue that received the most attention was Barbour’s proposal to remove the requirement that the casinos on the Coast be floating in the Mississippi Sound.
Katrina wreaked havoc on the floating casinos, and many operators said they would not rebuild if their casinos had to be in the Gulf waters. That was a crucial issue since the casinos were a major economic engine on the Coast, employing an estimated 30,000 in direct and indirect jobs.
It is difficult to fathom now the controversy surrounding Barbour’s proposal to allow the casinos to locate on land next to the water. Mississippi’s casino industry that was birthed with the early 1990s legislation was still new and controversial.
Various religious groups and others had continued to fight and oppose the casino industry and had made opposition to the expansion of gambling a priority.
Opposition to casinos and expansion of casinos was believed to be especially strong in rural areas, like those found in McCoy’s beloved northeast Mississippi. It was many of those rural areas that were the homes to rural white Democrats — now all but extinct in the Legislature but at the time still a force in the House.
So, voting in favor of casino expansion had the potential of being costly for what was McCoy’s base of power: the rural white Democrats.
Couple that with the fact that the Democratic-controlled House had been at odds with the Republican Barbour on multiple issues ranging from education funding to health care since Barbour was inaugurated in January 2004.
Barbour set records for the number of special sessions called by the governor. Those special sessions often were called to try to force the Democratic-controlled House to pass legislation it killed during the regular session.
The September 2005 special session was Barbour’s fifth of the year. For context, current Gov. Tate Reeves has called four in his nearly six years as governor.
There was little reason to expect McCoy to do Barbour’s bidding and lead the effort in the Legislature to pass his most controversial proposal: expanding casino gambling.
But when Barbour ally Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, who presided over the Senate, refused to take up the controversial bill, Barbour was forced to turn to McCoy.
The former governor wrote about the circumstances in an essay he penned on the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina for Mississippi Today Ideas.
“The Senate leadership, all Republicans, did not want to go first in passing the onshore casino law,” Barbour wrote. “So, I had to ask Speaker McCoy to allow it to come to the House floor and pass. He realized he should put the Coast and the state’s interests first. He did so, and the bill passed 61-53, with McCoy voting no.
“I will always admire Speaker McCoy, often my nemesis, for his integrity in putting the state first.”
Incidentally, former Rep. Bill Miles of Fulton, also in northeast Mississippi, was tasked by McCoy with counting, not whipping votes, to see if there was enough support in the House to pass the proposal. Not soon before the key vote, Miles said years later, he went to McCoy and told him there were more than enough votes to pass the legislation so he was voting no and broached the idea of the speaker also voting no.
It is likely that McCoy would have voted for the bill if his vote was needed.
Despite his no vote, the Biloxi Sun Herald newspaper ran a large photo of McCoy and hailed the Rienzi worm farmer as a hero for the Mississippi Gulf Coast.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04132613/AP100118024007.jpg,,,2025-09-07 08:57:22.504231

To live in the moment — to use our senses to ingest our surroundings and find an appreciation for every small felicity, in spite of our challenges — can be, for many, the only worthy purpose of life. For others, fulfillment is found in the promise of posterity. And for a third type, such as this week’s featured writer, Oliver Ellis of Belmont, happiness comes from straddling the two worlds: Experiencing new emotions, discovering new convictions through the process of committing them to the eternal page.
A young poet’s manifesto
Oliver Ellis, 14, Belmont
Anyone
can be a poet.
Anyone
can use their gift.
Anyone
can take a handful of words 
and make someone laugh with them.
The pen is my trigger,
the words my recipe – 
for tears,
for smiles,
for love,
and               
for hate too.
A pen is a search engine
without a filter,
and somehow it seems to know
what your weak spots are.
And every day – every single day – 
I pick up that pen and write. I write all the time, because   
someday there will be nothing left.
I use my words as an
excuse.
An alibi.
It’s who I am.
A conscientious
objector to    
conforming
and
being just like
everyone else.
     I think we need more words. Because at the end of the day, what else will be left? Not our silly paper money, that’s for sure. Not our fancy cars, not our mansions. Not our strict laws or closed-minded biases. 
     But I have a notion that our words and our emotions will always be, as a reminder of what’s at stake in this world: nothing and everything.

Many Democrats are calling for a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, like those used by the shooter at Annunciation and in countless other mass shootings. These firearms, dubbed “assault weapons” for their military-style design and lethality, were banned federally from 1994 to 2004, but states have since been left to their own devices to figure out their own legislation on assault weapons.
Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the focus on guns, instead proposing increased funding for school security and mental health treatment.
Gov. Tim Walz, in announcing his intention to call a special session, said the public is with Democrats on gun control and Republicans risked public backlash by voting against it.
“If you ask the public about an assault weapon ban, it polls at about 80%. So if you want to go to the next election against the public here when we had an opportunity to do something about this, then I leave that to you,” Walz said.
Banning assault weapons only polls that high with Democrats, but past polls show it does have support from a majority of Minnesotans. So do other gun control policies like requirements for universal background checks, which passed in 2023, and, according to this year’s informal State Fair poll, banning guns in the Capitol with nearly 80% support.
Here’s what past opinion polls found about how Minnesotans and Americans overall feel about gun control.
54% of Minnesotans in 2022 strongly or somewhat favored banning assault weapons




Nearly half of surveyed Minnesotans strongly favored banning assault weapons in a 2022 MinnPost poll conducted with Change Research. An additional 7% said they somewhat favored banning assault weapons. That’s slightly less than the nation as a whole, according to a 2023 Pew Research poll.
That result is roughly in line with an older poll from the Star Tribune, which found that 58% of Minnesotans were in favor of banning assault weapons in 2019.
The MinnPost poll responses varied widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats saying they strongly favored a ban compared to 11% of Republicans. Opinions on high-capacity magazines were similar.


In the same poll, a majority of Minnesotans said that they thought gun laws should be stricter, while only 16% said that gun laws should be less strict.
The 2022 poll had 1,551 respondents and was weighted to better reflect Minnesota’s demographics in age, gender, ethnicity, 2020 vote and region, according to the MinnPost article reporting the results.
The same percentage of Minnesotans in 2023 supported changes to statewide gun safety laws
A different poll in 2023 found that over half of Minnesotans supported changes to gun safety laws. The poll was published by two gun violence prevention nonprofits, Giffords and Protect Minnesota, and executed by Expedition Strategies, an opinion research company.
That poll of 1,300 respondents also showed that the majority of Minnesotans across political affiliations supported the red flag law and universal background check requirement that were  passed in Minnesota in 2023.
None of these Minnesota-specific polls in recent years asked voters their thoughts on firearm safe storage laws, which were passed in the House but never came up for vote in the Senate. A nationwide poll by APM Research Lab found that nearly 8 in 10 Americans supported mandating locked gun storage in 2019, which included 68% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats polled.
(Last year’s State Fair poll found that nearly 7 in 10 respondents supported mandating locked and unloaded gun storage.)
A majority of Americans in 2023 thought it was too easy to obtain a gun


A notebook in a YouTube video believed to be made by the Annunciation Church shooter said it was “shockingly easy” to buy a gun, the Star Tribune reported.
The majority of Americans agree. In a 2023 Pew Research poll, around 6 in 10 Americans said that it’s too easy to legally purchase a gun.
The answer varies widely by party affiliation, with 86% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning respondents saying it’s too easy to purchase a gun. Only 34% of Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents agreed.


We see the same patterns for opinions on banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Overall, Americans and especially Democrats supported bans, but over half of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents opposed such bans at the time of the poll.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-09-07 07:57:19.393154

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, speaks at Dakotafest in Mitchell on Aug. 20, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)On July 21, President Donald Trump wholeheartedly endorsed South Dakota’s junior Republican senator, Mike Rounds, in the lawmaker’s quest for a third term in 2026.
But at what cost for Rounds?
Despite calling the senator a “jerk” some years ago and vowing never to support him (because he called the 2020 election “fair”), the president in July praised Rounds, in a 180-degree turnaround, as an “incredibly strong advocate for the wonderful people of South Dakota” and said he was giving Rounds a “complete and total endorsement for re-election—HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!”
What a difference several years can make.
For Rounds’ reelection campaign, the direct support of the authoritarian-minded leader of his party and the nation, and of the free world, was extremely valuable — even critical.
“With Trump’s endorsement, Rounds will be a clear favorite to win reelection next year in the solidly conservative-leaning state,” according to The Hill, a leading political news source in the U.S. capital.
Rounds wins Trump endorsement after playing deal-making role in rescinding public media funds

However, as with many interactions with Trump, it was more transactional than genuinely moral or fairly reciprocal. A deal, in other words. But a very bad deal for rural Americans, it turns out.
For the president’s end of the deal, he wanted Rounds to vote “yes” in the Senate on a bill to cut $9 billion in previously congressionally approved funding that included $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The bill, which ultimately passed with Rounds’ support, removed all federal financial support for NPR, PBS and their member stations — and roughly $8 billion in foreign aid.
Trump signed an executive order in May demanding the cuts to the corporation, whose PBS and NPR outlets he has for years controversially complained have been spreading political and cultural views he disagrees with. Congress approved the cuts in July, and the corporation — “a cornerstone of American culture for three generations,” PBS fairly noted — was thus forced to shutter.
Initially, Rounds had expressed reservations concerning Trump’s desire to cancel the funding, but decided to support the executive action after announcing that he’d negotiated a deal with the administration to transfer $9.4 million of federal funding to some two dozen Native American radio stations in several states that depend on the subsidies for their survival. Indigenous South Dakotans are a key Rounds political constituency, comprising 78,000 people, about 9% of the state’s approximately 900,000 residents, many of them members of nine federally recognized tribes.
On his website, Rounds explained: “In order for me to support this legislation, we had to find a way to continue support for these radio stations which offer potentially life-saving information in some of the most rural parts of our nation. These stations play a vital role in South Dakota, delivering critical emergency alerts and public safety information, and they needed to be protected.
“… With nearly $37 trillion in federal debt, we must preserve essential services but also take meaningful steps to reduce wasteful spending. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue working to both rescind unnecessary spending and preserve funding for tribal radio in future appropriations bills.”

All well and good. But what about all the other Native (and non-Native) citizens throughout rural America? What about their public TV/radio stations — hundreds of them — that are presumably as critical for their communities and as deserving of federal support as those serving Indigenous South Dakotans?
Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voted against the cuts, stressed that “more targeted” means exist to address any alleged bias at PBS and NPR other than cutting all funding, in effect throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It could also be fairly argued that PBS and NPR have long been renowned for fair, balanced reporting and programming, though they arguably lean liberal.
In a perfect world, Rounds would have ultimately voted “no” to the cuts, thus tanking Trump’s biased, mean-spirited executive order that will disadvantage millions of rural Americans. As it was, Vice President J.D. Vance had to deliver the tie-breaking vote to begin debate on the bill when Sens. Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky each voted “no.”
If Rounds had joined those colleagues on their moral high ground, now-doomed PBS and NPR stations might have survived to serve the underserved another day.
But he regrettably chose self-interest over self-respect — reelection over uprightness.

THE PRIMARY CARE CRISIS in Massachusetts and the nation is omnipresent. Primary care providers—physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates—are burning out in record numbers. According to the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, lower-income residents “are most likely to have no primary care use” because of staff shortages and other barriers. Ad[...]","THE PRIMARY CARE CRISIS in Massachusetts and the nation is omnipresent. Primary care providers—physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates—are burning out in record numbers. According to the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, lower-income residents “are most likely to have no primary care use” because of staff shortages and other barriers. Administrative burdens plague primary care practice, and pay is much lower compared with specialty providers. These obstacles discourage current clinicians from staying and new ones from joining. Community health centers, the respected bastion of primary care, experience these trends at even worse rates.  
The crisis caught the attention of Gov. Maura Healey in her January State of the State address, in which she called out the issue for special attention. “I am directing my administration to shift health care resources to the front lines. And by that I mean primary care,” she said. “We’ll drive career training pipelines to grow the workforce. I want a whole army of primary care providers out there, so when you call for an appointment, you’ll get one. You’ll get the affordable care you need, where and when you need it.”  
Just weeks before her speech, the governor signed a health market reform bill that established a 25-member Primary Care Access, Delivery and Payment Task Force to recommend steps to stabilize and strengthen primary care statewide, with a September deadline for their initial recommendations. 
Given these challenges, one might expect that a new plan from CVS Health and Mass General Brigham to launch expanded primary care services at 37 CVS “Minute Clinics” across the state might help. In early June, each filed similar and separate applications for plan approval from the Health Policy Commission to launch the initiative. 
At this point, essential details are too sketchy to endorse or reject the proposal. While the need is too great to dismiss the idea out of hand, their plan is missing answers to key finance, operational, and workforce questions. One thing is certain — the CVS-MGB plan needs close scrutiny.
The plan must be considered in the context of the state’s primary care task force and its emerging vision for a reformed primary care system. We hope that the Health Policy Commission digs deeply into key questions and votes to perform a detailed cost and market impact review, which could happen as soon as later this month, with a finalized report to follow before the year’s end or more likely early 2026.
Mass General Brigham, the state’s leading mega-medical care provider, has a disappointing recent history in primary care. This past May, MGB leaders announced a $400 million five-year non-specific investment to bolster their own primary care system. Without details, it stands as a guilty plea to their underinvestment. What is the connection between this “investment” and the CVS-MGB plan? Your guess is as good as ours. 
More evidence of neglect came from MGB’s primary care physicians who voted 183-26 in late May to unionize. Certification of their election has been delayed by President Trump and Senate Republicans’ slow-walking appointments to fill vacancies on the National Labor Relations Board. Absent new appointees, no union elections can be certified. MGB also has filed election challenges that are familiar tactics of union busters.
More than MGB, CVS Health appears to be the lead driver here, seeking to re-energize their 20-year lackluster urgent care business named “MinuteClinics.” Competitors Walmart and Walgreens abandoned or scaled back their own failed retail clinic operations. 
CVS is now pushing a national corporate turnaround strategy by establishing hospital/medical center affiliations with their clinics in 26 states plus rolling out an enhanced MGB-style primary care model in nine of them, now including Massachusetts. CVS Health, also owner of insurer giant Aetna, fired its CEO, Karen Lynch, in 2024 for unsatisfactory profits and briefly considered splitting the company apart. The MGB affiliation is but one part of their aggressive strategy to regain high profits for their disappointed shareholders.
While nurse practitioners are a huge and growing part of the primary care workforce, the most successful primary care models use them as part of onsite teams that includes physicians. The CVS-MGB plan would keep them solo, with broader clinical duties and physician support only on call. Primary care physicians with whom we spoke see this primarily as a recipe for unneeded specialty and ancillary service referrals to MGB along with nurse practitioner burnout. 
Also concerning are financial implications of this plan. Nurse practitioners would join the CVS-MGB network in CVS facilities as MinuteClinic employees. They will make referrals to MGB providers for specialty care, labs, and imaging plus hospital services.
MGB intends to include these clinics in their managed care contracts as part of its Accountable Care Organization.  While their hope will be to reduce emergency department utilization and costs, those savings could be swamped by new revenues resulting from high priced referrals to MGB specialists and facilities for additional care and ancillary services. 
On its face, this seems to be a high-priced money winner for both CVS Health and MGB.  
The Health Policy Commission should explore the spending implications for 120,000 patients projected in this new arrangement. Should reimbursement rates for commercially insured patients referred by CVS be capped to mitigate pressures to raise premiums that will result as MGB gains market share from this new partnership. Would this scheme weaken MGB competitors who rely on these referrals and will lose market share?
On the flip side, while members of the state’s primary care task force are exploring big systemic changes to set a new long-term future for primary care in Massachusetts, their model likely will require legislative action that could take years to enact and to implement. Meanwhile, too many patients are desperate for primary care services now. The CVS-MGB initiative, while not close to an overall solution, might help some patients who feel the full brunt of the primary care crisis. 
Much more needs to be revealed in the Health Policy Commission review process. Marginal, short-term gains in primary care access should not come at the expense of making the whole system more expensive and less stable. Yet, a long-term solution should not halt viable incremental improvements that may improve care for patients and consumers badly served by today’s structure. Since most observers agree that primary care suffers from severe underinvestment, should we reject a proposal that would make such an investment? A seemingly simple proposal quickly becomes much more complicated.
As so often is the case in Massachusetts health policy, the wisest voice in the room is that of Sen. Cindy Friedman, co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Health Care Financing as well as a member of the primary care task force. She told us: “The notion that this is primary care is disturbing to me because primary care is comprehensive and collaborative. … How do you do that in a MinuteClinic in a CVS? … It presents a false narrative of what primary care needs to be.” Referring to MGB, she added, “If you have $400 million to spend, how about scholarships or loan forgiveness or expanding residency programs triple fold?”
Meanwhile, if MGB president and CEO Anne Klibanski wants to demonstrate interest in improving and upgrading primary care in her own system, she could begin tomorrow morning by recognizing the union that 88% of her primary care physicians voted for last May. That would be a solid signal and a good step forward. How about it, Anne?

The community oven was first lit in late October 2017, built in an effort led by former legislator and selectboard member Mark Woodward and librarian Jen Burton.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Sept. 4
On the Thursday before Labor Day, the town of Johnson gathered around its community oven.
This has been a regular occurrence at Legion Field on School Street for nearly eight years and has expanded to include Halloween bakes and “skate and bakes” in the winter, when an ice rink is set up in the park. Members of the town’s community oven committee, many of whom have been involved since the oven’s inception, pull a pie out of the stone column’s fiery maw — sometimes it’s a classic cheese pie, sometimes a custom creation — and place it before a crowd that devours each slice.
Thursday’s affair was like many of the bakes that had gone before it, but more so. There were the usual pickup soccer games, but this time they were led by athletes from Vermont State University’s Johnson campus. Hardwick’s Kingdom Creamery was selling ice cream and a raffle raised $268 for the Johnson Food Shelf. There were Charcuterie boards adorned with meat and cheese from the Johnson General Store. At a set of grills next to the oven, Jesse Whitworth grilled hamburgers and portobello mushrooms, the fragrance of which mingled with the sound of live music; all 90 burgers were gone by the end of the night.
The community oven was first lit in late October 2017, built in an effort led by former legislator and selectboard member Mark Woodward and librarian Jen Burton. Jasmine Yuris, who now chairs the community oven committee, was there at the beginning, as was Sophia Berard, who was shaping the dough before handing it to her husband, Luke Gellatly, who knows the temperament of the oven well enough to produce pies consistently with a chewy, char-kissed crust.
Yuris remembered the early conversations around building a community oven, following the example of other towns in Vermont.
“How can we make food access something that everyone experiences, rather than this idea of charity, which is just for people who need it? We all need it and deserve it,” she said.
The oven cost $8,000 to build eight years ago and has likely produced well over that amount in free meals since then. In classic Vermont fashion, it’s built upon remnants of the past — some of its stones were once part of a former talc mill in the town, according to Seven Days.
Even as the work of the oven appears straightforward, the labor and logistics required to put on the community bakes is challenging. Yuris made the dough used in the bakes in her own home the first few years before securing dough from Elmore Mountain Bread — Berard worked there as a baker before becoming a therapist. This year, for the first time in the oven’s history, they’ve used actual pizza dough. Gellatly makes the sauce with water from Johnson’s cold spring. Toppings and salad ingredients are sourced from Morrisville nonprofit Salvation Farms or purchased locally at Foote Brook Farm.
Other than the occasional repair to its stone edifice, the oven has not changed much since it was built, but the oven committee mission has evolved over the years. In the early phase of social distancing during the Covid pandemic, volunteers donned masks and gloves, and the oven became a takeout spot.
After the flood of July 2023, the oven provided free food to the community in the wake of the devastation, while pizzas were packed up and sent to the selectboard as it worked through the response. When a less damaging flood hit a year later, the committee considered calling off the bake scheduled for that week, but pressed ahead.
“I remember that was more of a question of, like, we’ve all been through this before. Is this too traumatic for us to still hold this thing and continue?” Yuris recalled. “But it all comes back to everybody’s got to eat, and it’s better to eat together, especially on a day like that, so we just continued and did the thing.”
The expanded bake night held last week was a combined effort between the oven committee and the nascent food access task force, one of several ad hoc groups formed in the wake of last year’s “Reimagine Johnson” effort, coordinated by the Vermont Council on Rural Development in effort to address the challenges the town faced after repeated flooding.

After a successful community dinner hosted at the Vermont Studio Center, the task force looked to hold an August event to benefit the Johnson food shelf, which has seen increased need over the summer after serving over 300 people in July alone, according to board member Diane Suter. Hampered by the fact that, unlike the oven committee, the task force is not an entity formally associated with the municipal government, the decision was made to expand the final bake of the summer for the benefit of the food shelf.
“We’re trying to be additive,” Whitworth said.
The task force and oven committee already share members and have similar missions. Yuris, who serves on both, said that, amid the town’s effort to consolidate the groups, she hopes to see a new food access committee take over and expand the oven’s efforts.
The oven, after all, has become more than a way to feed everyone. It’s grown into a symbol of what can be achieved through collective work, much like its new neighbor at Legion Field, the Johnson Public Library, which was moved from its flood-prone former home on Railroad Street earlier this year. When selectboard member Adrienne Parker and her partner Blake moved to Johnson from Rhode Island during the pandemic, volunteering for the oven committee was what she described as the “gateway drug” to getting more involved in the community.
“After the flood, we liked Johnson almost more because we saw how the community responded to each other. Everyone was thinking about each other,” Blake said. “In the places we’ve lived before, it’s kind of like, you’re on your own. Here, everyone’s thinking about everyone else and being strong for each other, thinking of how you can help your community members, even if you’re not affected, and I don’t know, that’s just really beautiful.”

Those whose drinking water comes from the lake are at risk of exposure to PFAS and other harmful chemicals from a variety of sources. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Protecting Lake Memphremagog from PFAS must be a priority.","Dear Editor,
I was fortunate to attend a presentation on the geology and hydrogeology of the Memphremagog region sponsored by Memphremagog Watershed Association on Aug. 13. 
I learned so much from Vermont geologists Steven Wright and Jonathan Kim, who is also a geologist with the Vermont Geological Survey. 
It was a great opportunity to learn how our region was formed by glacial advance and retreat over many millennia, how rivers and lakes were formed and how this affects our watershed today. Of the many facts provided, it was fascinating to learn how the Clyde River, Lake Willoughby and Crystal Lake all contributed their north-flowing waters to what became the Lake Memphremagog we know today.
Another point of interest to me is that Kim emphasized that the groundwater and surface water in our watershed are a system, meaning the ground and surface waters are interconnected and constantly cycle, with groundwater becoming surface water and vice versa. Whatever enters the groundwater drains to surface waters, including rivers and other tributaries of the South Bay and Lake Memphremagog. 
This is an important consideration given the location of the state’s only landfill in Coventry, sited in the drainage basin of the lake. Harmful, even hazardous, “forever” PFAS chemicals have been measured in the groundwater wells and underdrains around and beneath the landfill for years. 
This is evidence that PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and other contaminants escape the landfill, enter groundwater and inevitably drain into the surface waters of Lake Memphremagog, accumulating over time. 
Those whose drinking water comes from the lake, including well over 175,000 Quebec neighbors, are at risk of exposure to PFAS and other harmful chemicals from a variety of sources. 
This is a fact that must not be taken lightly. 
Protecting our lake’s water — and all who depend on it for survival, including fish and wildlife — from chemical contamination from any source must be a priority. 
The state Agency of Natural Resources — regulators of waste management in Vermont — bears responsibility to prevent discharge of PFAS and other chemicals into our environment. 
Residents on both sides of our Vermont-Canadian border deserve the strictest regulation, the safest and most effective waste management technologies and practices to ensure the health and safety of the public and the environment.

Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has heard all the talk about Democrats hemorrhaging voters because of unaddressed economic fears. But the onetime physician, presidential candidate and national party chair has a different diagnosis.
“It’s true the Democrats forgot the working class, but we are not appealing to the next generation,” he began a recent interview. “Younger people don’t like longwinded mealy-mouthing, which is a problem in our party. Washington has never had a clue, but it’s particularly out of touch with a bunch of old folks running everything.” 
Dean was 22 when he earned a political science degree, 29 when he graduated from medical school, 33 when he won election as a state representative and 37 when he became lieutenant governor — only to turn 40 and skyrocket into the political stratosphere.
As governor from 1991 to 2003, Dean pushed to expand health care, starting with Dr. Dynasaur coverage for children and teenagers. As a presidential contender in 2004, he plugged into student support by pioneering online organizing, spurring Politico to deem him “the father of all web campaigns.” As head of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2011, he popularized a “50-state strategy” in hopes of growing the grassroots.
Then hitting 75 last year, Dean toyed with another run for governor, only to ultimately stay on the sidelines.
“I didn’t talk to anybody who I trusted who thought it was a good idea, and I don’t really know how to negotiate this world anymore,” he recalled. “I do my banking at the counter, where they say, ‘You could save yourself a lot of trouble if you just go online.’ I won’t because of the security problems. And I’ve never used Amazon. I want to keep my money in Vermont.”
And so the grandfather of three is aiming to embolden a new generation.
“People in their 70s and 80s need to understand our place and get the hell out of the way,” Dean said. “I’m not saying we ought to kick old people to the side or turn everything over to 20-year-olds, although we need a society where they feel they fit in. But I think leadership has to be between 35 and 50.”
Dean admits that can be a challenge in the Green Mountain State, where the median age is the third highest in the nation, the U.S. census reports. The number of older Vermonters has risen by 80% since 2000 — about one in every three residents is now over 60 — while figures for youth under age 20 have dropped by almost 20%.
Dean adds it’s not always easy to hand over the remote when you’ve long held the control.
“As a parent, there’s a role for you as your kids get older, but it’s not what it was.”
That said, Dean isn’t ready to go quietly.

‘The nurse knocks’
Two decades ago, most 20-year-olds knew everything about Dean, the original Vermont youth magnet before U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ran for president in 2016 and 2020. But today’s students either weren’t born or in school when the doctor unintentionally made history on Jan. 19, 2004, with his TikTok-enduring “Dean Scream.”
Born in New York City in 1948, the son of a stockbroker graduated from Yale University in 1971, then tried his hand pouring concrete, washing dishes and finally attending the Bronx’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Meeting and marrying fellow student Judith Steinberg, he was rejected by his top three hospital choices before winning acceptance at his fourth — the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.
Juggling jobs as a physician and part-time lieutenant governor, Dean chose not to run for the state’s top spot when it came open in 1990. Then Gov. Richard Snelling died of a heart attack a year later.
“I was seeing a patient and the nurse knocks,” recalled Dean, who finished the checkup (“I knew the patient wouldn’t be able to get another appointment for quite some time”) before his emergency swearing-in on Aug. 14, 1991.
Serving as governor through 2002, Dean proved hard to pigeonhole. On one hand, he was a fiscal conservative who cut income taxes while balancing the state budget 11 years in a row — all while receiving an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association. Then again, he signed a landmark 2000 law creating same-sex civil unions after the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that all couples have the right to marriage benefits.
The separate-but-equal compromise forged by the Legislature angered both voters wanting no distinction (same-sex marriage wouldn’t come until 2009) and those who opposed any deal. Dean faced so many threats, he had to wear a bulletproof vest when he ran for his fifth and final term.
Amid it all, Dean helped lead the National Governors Association and hinted at higher aspirations by hosting his 49 peers and then-President Bill Clinton at the group’s 1995 conference in Burlington. But everyone was still surprised when he entered the 2004 race for the White House.

‘The Darkest Horse’
The press soon introduced Dean to the nation, but not necessarily in the way he had hoped.
The cover of The New Republic of July 1, 2002, carried the headline, “Invisible Man:  The most intriguing presidential candidate you’ve never seen.” The American Prospect of July 15, 2002, presented a profile titled “The Darkest Horse.” The New York Times of Dec. 18, 2002, summed up its story: “The governor of Vermont will battle the ‘Who’s he?’ factor.”
Dean told the Times he wanted to follow in the footsteps of President Jimmy Carter, a onetime little-known governor who the Vermonter supported as a 1980 delegate to the Democratic National Convention. But Dean was polling far behind a slew of his party’s members of Congress, all of whom supported then Republican President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq.
That’s when Dean spoke out.
“’What I want to know is why in the world the Democratic Party leadership is supporting the president’s unilateral attack on Iraq?” he was quoted at the national committee’s 2003 winter meeting. “I’m Howard Dean, and I’m here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.”
By summer, Dean was deemed a “maverick” by USA Today, an “insurgent” by the Los Angeles Times and worthy of a cover story by Time magazine.
“Today he has a shot at winning his party’s nomination,” Time wrote in its Aug. 11, 2003 issue. “What’s unclear is whether he has surged because contributors and poll respondents think he is a new kind of Old Democrat — a candidate who will finally revive the left — or because those contributors and respondents know the truth — he is a rock-ribbed budget hawk, a moderate on gays and guns, and a true lefty on only a few issues, primarily the use of U.S. military power, which Dean seems to regard with a mixture of contempt and suspicion.”
Whatever Dean was, “he’s all that and a stick of gum,” political strategist Donna Brazile told the magazine. “He’s that hot. The flavor has not left him.”

‘Nothing to do with it’
By the beginning of 2004, more than 500,000 supporters had signed up on deanforamerica.com, each contributing an average of $77 for a collective total of $50 million, according to finance records.
“I get all this credit for the campaign,” Dean recently recalled. “I had absolutely nothing to do with it.”
The candidate instead points to tech-savvy youth who, in a first, harnessed the web for organizing and fundraising. But they knew more about programming a computer than working the political machine. Dean placed third in Iowa on Jan. 19 (the scream wasn’t the cause, but instead came in response), second in New Hampshire on Jan. 27 and third in Wisconsin on Feb. 17 before withdrawing from the race.
“Dean looked for a moment as if he might shake the political universe with a blunt-spoken, nontraditional style,” the Washington Post reported in a postmortem. “He found the same freewheeling approach that drew such fanfare was an engine of his demise.”
“His vaunted decentralized movement of political newcomers lacked experience and agility,” the Times added, “failing to quickly make or clearly communicate critical decisions.”
Dean went on to head the Democratic National Committee, offer commentary on MSNBC and teach as a senior fellow at Yale’s Jackson School of Global Affairs. Since retiring from those posts, he’s now chair of the Democratic Data Exchange, which collects and shares voter contact information.
“Really smart young people are running it — all I do is keep order,” he said. “The only reason I’m chair is because somebody decided I was the only one who could get along with all the people in the Democratic Party who hated each other.” 
When Dean ran to lead the Democratic National Committee in 2005, Republicans held the presidency and both chambers of Congress. Two decades later, the Vermonter says the situation is similar “but the generation gap is bigger than it’s ever been.”
Dean recalls when Americans received their news from the same national television networks, state newspapers and local radio stations.
“Today you have 10 different versions of everything,” he said. “It’s going to be a big problem for this new generation, which is going to be separated from each other by which TikTok influencers they watch, and for the world in terms of how you establish any kind of notion of what’s true and what’s not.”

‘What’s new about that?’
Dean is a strong proponent of shared context. When his children were in elementary school, he read them an unusual bedtime story: David McCullough’s 1,120-page biography of President Harry Truman.
“They still laugh about it,” he said. “They didn’t feel like it was being abusive.”
For adults, Dean suggests two books: “Thomas Chittenden: Vermont’s First Statesman,” a 1997 history by Frank Smallwood about the state’s founding governor; and “Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State,” a 2011 account by Samuel Hand, Anthony Marro and Stephen Terry of the 20th-century leader who ushered in a shift from Republican to Democratic rule.
“All this shapes who we are and why we’re different,” he said.
For Dean, the books also shed light on the present disconnect between state and national politics — and why he sees hope.
“Yeah, you’ve got a neofascist government, but I’m an optimist, and I’ll tell you why,” he said. “When I went to college, I had two Black roommates. They had never been to school with a white person and I had never been to school with a Black person. My junior year was the first time women were permitted to enroll in the Ivy League. And I don’t know a single person in my class who dared to say they were gay.”
That was then.
“The amount of change that’s happened over my generation has just been staggering, and I have hope the new generation isn’t going to like authoritarian rule,” he said. “I see my role is to coach young people — and offer an occasional intervention when Democrats in Washington get particularly stupid.”
Dean is repeating his longtime calls for the national party to seed and feed the grassroots by coordinating and contributing to local and state organizing. He’s also offering his support to self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in his current bid for New York City mayor.
“Republicans are playing by a new set of rules now, and I think Democrats have got to toughen up,” Dean said. “We don’t have to give up our ideals, but we do have to talk differently.”
More plain spoken, he explained, and less politically correct.
“I just say what I want,” Dean concluded. “What’s new about that?”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)For at least a moment earlier this year, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins was willing to depart from his typical far-right, far-fetched stances to take a position most would label liberal – on a criminal justice matter, of all things. 
Yet just months later, the Lafayette Republican is back to his extremist ways. What’s different now is that he appears rudderless, permanently veering to the right to the point where it could be argued he’s merely spinning  in political circles. 
Heads turned during the spring session of the Louisiana Legislature when Higgins, a former policeman, gave his support to a proposal that would have let people put in Louisiana prisons by non-unanimous juries seek reviews of their cases. The lawman-turned-lawmaker urged the “swift passage” of the bill by state Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, arguing it preserved the U.S. Constitution’s rights to due process and a fair trial.  
“You could not have told me in my 42 years on this earth that I would have a letter from Congressman Clay Higgins supporting a bill that I brought,” Duplessis told colleagues on the Senate floor before they resoundingly rejected the measure. Opponents in the Republican supermajority said the policy change would overload prosecutors and court staff. 
In recent days, Higgins has come out firing on all cylinders but with no clear direction ascertainable. 
On Aug. 29, he sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson saying that he was stepping down from the House Homeland Security Committee after Rep. Andrew Garabino, R-N.Y., was named its new chairman. Higgins, a candidate for the post, appeared dejected after the vote.  
“My Republican colleagues have chosen an alternate path for the Committee that I helped to build,” he wrote to Johnson, “a path more in alignment with the less conservative factions of our Conference, factions whose core principles are quite variant from my own conservative perspective on key issues like amnesty, ICE operations, and opposition to the surveillance state.”
That’s the Higgins we’ve come to know – bitter, self-righteous and steered by conspiracy theories. As he still sits on the House Armed Services and the Oversight and Government Reform committees (chairing the latter’s law enforcement subcommittee), there will be ample chances for him to make bluster’s last stand. 
And by no means will Higgins limit himself to those matters. A week ago, he urged the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services to withhold federal funding from “organizations that push COVID vaccines on young children.” 
It followed his pledge on social media to “defund” the New Orleans Health Department for promoting the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children from 6 months to 2 years old. 
“State sponsored weakening of the citizenry, absolute injury to our children and calculated decline of fertility,” Higgins wrote in an Aug. 20 X post.
Call me a skeptic, but if there’s a group out there that’s least likely to be anti-fertility, it’s probably pediatricians. It’s not good for their business model.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Higgins’ latest play for political relevance came Thursday when he joined forces with Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., Oversight and Government Reform chairman, to investigate allegations that pharmacy chain CVS Health used “confidential patient information” to lobby the Louisiana Legislature.  
Caremark, a CVS subsidiary, is the prescription benefit manager for the health insurance plan that covers state employees in Louisiana. Attorney General Liz Murrill is suing the company, saying it used information gained through that contract to send text messages to state employees asking them to oppose proposed legislation. The bill in question would have prohibited prescription benefit managers from co-owning pharmacies. Ultimately, lawmakers opted for a less aggressive, transparency measure with the support of independent pharmacies.
Critics consider the co-ownership arrangement self-serving, as the management entities have a direct say in how their affiliated pharmacies price – and profit from – prescription drugs.
Comer and Higgins have requested CVS Health president and CEO David Joyner provide a slate of records to aid in their investigation. 
David Whitrap, who handles external relations for CVS, said in an email the company plans to respond to Comer and Higgins. With regards to the text messages, its communication with customers, patients and the community “was consistent with the law,” he said. 
As much as he wants to position himself to the far right, Higgins’ involvement in accountability efforts such as this makes him a centrist – at least on this issue. The battle against pharmacy benefit managers is a bipartisan one, with both sides looking to claim the win for bringing down prescription drug and health insurance costs.
Regardless, it’s a welcome moment of lucidity from Higgins, much like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s demand for the U.S. Department of Justice to produce all its files on Jeffrey Epstein. 
No one expects it, but it’s certainly welcomed.   
For Higgins, more frequent stances like this could help him emerge from the shadow of Louisiana’s more prominent Republicans in the House – Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
But if history portends what lies ahead from Higgins, expect him to once again find his comfort zone on the fringes.

Tamara Taylor has played softball, volleyball and basketball, but tackle football hits different — literally.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“I just like to hit people and have fun,” said Taylor, 31, defensive lineman for Denver’s Mile High Blaze women’s tackle football team. “When I moved to Denver, that’s when I found out about football in general … I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
Taylor and players like her are punting football’s traditional gender norms — tackle is for boys and men, flag is for girls and women — with a growing fan base across the country. And the sports world is taking notice: The Women’s Football Alliance (WFA) — home to the Blaze — became the first women’s tackle football league to secure a multiyear network deal with ESPN2, and the league’s national championship has been broadcast on the sports network for the last three years.
This year’s national championship brought in 969,000 total live viewers, making it the most-watched game on ESPN2 that day. The WFA’s St. Louis Slam took home the win against the DC Divas with a final score of 26-14.
The WFA has also announced expansion into Canada this year. The women’s tackle league has partnered with Cosmos Sports & Entertainment, a sports marketing firm based in Ontario, to identify cities in Canada that could host a team.

Lisa King, a former semi-professional soccer player, founded the WFA in 2009. The alliance is the oldest and largest women’s tackle football league in the world. With 60 teams across three divisions, the league has 12 professional teams.
King was interested in playing football throughout her childhood, but her parents denied her opportunity. After graduating from college, she jumped at the chance to play for a women’s tackle football team in Los Angeles. In founding the league, she wanted to use a similar structure as the soccer teams she had excelled in and bring it to women’s tackle football.
Ten years later, in 2019, Odessa Jenkins, a former player for the WFA, expanded opportunities by creating the Women’s National Football Conference (WNFC). Made up of 17 teams, the WNFC may be smaller in size, but has made an impact on the future of women in football by having a robust branding infrastructure in place to amplify the sport, including creative direction. Jenkins, who played and coached for the WFA’s Dallas Elite, aims to expand opportunities for women football players so that they get the level of recognition they deserve.
For the WNFC, this year marks the first time they have broadcast their national championship game on ESPN2. The matchup between the Texas Elite Spartans and Washington Prodigy came with a new high in digital engagement. The broadcast gained 150,000 championship viewers and more than 150,000 followers on Instagram, a 61% increase since 2024. The league’s TikTok account also doubled since last year, with over 46,000 followers.
And ideally, that recognition will come with pay for players — in the WNFC and the WFA. While neither league provides a salary for players, the WNFC does offer prize money to championship teams. With help from sponsorships by brands like Adidas, Dove and Riddell, the WNFC provided players on the championship team with $20,000. The WFA did not provide a monetary prize for the championship, but was able to cover some costs for players.
“It’s truly a pay-to-play type of situation because we’re not paying these wonderful athletes,” said Rob Sandlin, head coach of the Mile High Blaze, who noted that the financial strain and dedication required can be the biggest challenges for players new to the sport. “We try to be as brutally honest as possible when it comes to what to expect. The one thing that most rookies don’t quite understand is the level of dedication that’s required.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Players must pay dues to remain part of the team, but payment doesn’t guarantee they’ll see time on the field.
“The physical aspects we can explain. The mental parts of the competition can be explained. The idea of how much work you have to put into it is probably the one thing that I get back from people that decide, ‘Yeah, I can’t do this,’ more than anything,” he said.
According to sports news site Marca, the average NFL salary in 2024 was about $3.2 million. While women don’t play for NFL teams, there has been growth in opportunities for women to be on staff. The NFL now has the most full-time women coaches of any professional men’s sports league, with 15 women holding coaching positions across departments.
While girls have access to flag football, a low-contact variant of tackle football, the sport traditionally separates based on gender as young athletes get older. Youth flag football has co-ed opportunities for players ranging from 5 to 17 years old. Tackle football more commonly has restrictions on girls and women playing, both during adolescence and adulthood.
Women’s flag football is seeing growth of its own, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics announcing that they will have women’s flag football teams competing for the first time. The NFL has also received bids for future investments in women’s professional flag football leagues this year.
Challenges aside, being in a high-contact sport as a woman has proven to be a unique and rewarding experience for these football players, whether they started playing as children with their siblings or discovered tackle as adults.
For Yolanda “YoYo” Searcy, football was etched in her life at a young age. Breaking with tradition, her Florida high school offered her a spot on the all-boys football team.
“The head coach coached all my siblings and was like, ‘I know what you can do,’” she said.
She declined and joined a school-sanctioned flag football team instead. Years later, she got her chance to play with other tackle-loving women as a linebacker with the Mile High Blaze.
Rosa Climaco, who has been an offensive lineman for the WNFC’s Washington Prodigy for three years, feels she could have benefited from finding football earlier. As someone interested in incorporating fitness into her lifestyle, Climaco finds football to be the perfect choice.
“One night scrolling on Instagram at 3 a.m., I found [WFA player] Lois Cook’s Instagram and just started going down the rabbit hole. I’m like, ‘Whoa, there is a legitimate football league that exists for women,’ and really the only regret I have is that I found it when I was 31,” she said.
Some players find that they have to balance the societal expectation for women to curb aggression with the demand for them to play rough to win.
“I personally think there’s caution tape around aggression even still in women’s football,” said Kourtney “KP” Purham, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy. “The idea for men obviously is to be aggressive at its most violent level. One of the things our coach says this year is ‘I support organized violence,’ but it’s like him selling that to us because women are taught not to be that way.”
“So, you’re now trying to navigate through what violence looks like in a sport that was designed for men to be violent and still how to be a lady in a violent sport,” Purham said.

Tapping into aggression comes more naturally to some of these athletes than others. While some players found tackle football to be a place where they could release that side of their personalities, others have had to embrace their aggressive side for the first time.
“A lot of the time for me, it was always, ‘You’re too loud, you’re too rough, you’re too this, you’re too that,’” said Washington Prodigy linebacker and captain Ramzeh Deen-sie.“I was still seeking a way to get out my aggression and just be who I am in my true, natural self.”
Deen-sie describes her transition from playing offense to playing defense as a perfect fit for her personality.
“It was just like, ‘OK, you want me to tackle whoever got the ball. You want me to put my shoulder pads through their chest and make sure they cannot come get you the next play,’” she said. “‘I can do that cause I’m already aggressive, I like to fight, I’m always on 10. I can do this.’”
Tonique’a Jackson, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy, has a much different relationship with aggression. For her, focusing on protecting her teammates has allowed her to move with more force on the field.
“I think trying to find that aggressive part of me, it took a really really long time. If it wasn’t being knocked over, if it wasn’t being tripped up, if it wasn’t being yelled at, it’s like you have to tap into the dog inside of you ’cause it’s either beat or be beaten, and that’s where my aggression comes from,” she said.
Outside of pushing her to explore her self-expression, playing football has also allowed Jackson to carry on a family legacy.
“In 2021, I lost my son to gun violence. He was very big in football, and [it was] something that was really, really important to him,” she said. “I wanted to find a way to not only stay connected to him but to also keep his dream alive because I felt like it was taken from him at such a short time in his life.”
Players say they’re satisfied with the growing recognition for their sport — and their representation in it.
“Just to see now with the progression of us being kind of everywhere, involved in coaching at the high school level, too, we’re getting a lot more fans out,” said Mile High Blaze quarterback Kimberly Santistevan. “Whether they know us directly or they’ve heard of us and they want to see us and check us out … the stands are getting fuller and fuller every year.”

The state Fish & Wildlife Department is leading a study to find out.

For the fourth year in a row, Vermont’s black bear population size far outpaced what the state projected. 
Last year, the state had an estimated 6,800 to 8,000 bears, nearly double the objective of 3,500 to 5,500 bears, outlined by a Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department population model.
Why is the population doing so well? There are two big factors that determine population size, said Jaclyn Comeau, the Black Bear Project leader at the state Fish & Wildlife Department: mortality rates and reproduction rates.
The state has a pretty good sense of what is influencing bear mortality, she said. Hunters are responsible for most premature bear deaths, followed by vehicle collisions. Freak accidents, like a bear chewing an electrical wire, can also cause a bear’s early death. Still, populations are continuing to “grow and grow,” Comeau said. 
Looking at reproduction is “kind of that missing piece of information that we don’t have” when it comes to understanding what drives that trend, according to Comeau. A new study launched this summer aims to tackle that question and better pinpoint what type of habitat and food availability supports healthy bear birth rates.
Since the 1980s, the “backbone” to steady population growth has been the wider recovery of suitable habitat for bears, Comeau said, as forest grew back across a landscape previously dominated by deforestation and farm land. The agricultural Vermont of the 1940s and 1950s left bears confined to the spine of the Green Mountains, she said. In those days, killing bears was far more common, without the hunting regulations and restricted season Vermont has today.
Still, the Fish & Wildlife Department would like to better understand how availability of different food sources might influence where the bears go and how successful they are in reproduction, especially as they spread down from the mountains. 
In the mountains, beechnuts are bears’ primary fall food source, but the trees’ nut production pulses every two or three years. Historically, bear populations have risen and fallen with these cycles.  
In the valleys, oak trees — and thus, acorns — are more abundant and more consistent.
“We’re wondering if now that the bear population has moved out of the mountains, if they’re accessing higher-quality habitat where food is more consistent,” Comeau said. “Now that they’re in the valleys, potentially, the habitat might be more productive and allowing their populations to grow.” 
To answer that, the department’s study follows 18 adult female bears fitted with GPS tracking collars that allow biologists to see where the bears are, presumably getting food. The study aims to isolate these two distinct habitat areas by looking at nine bears in the Connecticut River Valley and nine others in the southern Green Mountains. In the winter, the scientists will visit the bears’ dens to confirm how many cubs the mother has, with the intent of following the family and cub survival through their first year of life. Fish & Wildlife anticipates letting the survey run for six years in order to collect enough data to draw conclusions.
Better understanding the conditions in which bears are thriving will allow the department to better protect and manage their habitat, Comeau said. 
The prosperity of Vermont’s black bears is a rare success, as many species decline due to habitat loss, changes in food availability and environmental shifts, among a range of other environmental shifts brought on by climate change. 
Black bears are especially flexible when it comes to habitat and food. As omnivores, they can survive off multiple food sources, and their wide range, from Florida and Mexico to Canada, shows they can adapt to a variety of habitats and temperatures.
Still it does not mean that a changing climate will leave the bears unaffected, Comeau said. 
Comeau worries what the encroachment of beech leaf disease in Vermont’s forests will mean for the bear population over the next decade. 
And as Vermont’s winter season shrinks, people should expect bears to enter hibernation later in the year and emerge earlier in the spring. That, plus a growing population spreading beyond the mountains, makes bears more likely to encounter humans. For Comeau, this underscores a need to figure out how to foster the best coexistence.
The department added that Vermont’s bear hunting season started Monday and runs through Nov. 14. Hunters are allowed to kill collared bears, but Fish & Wildlife asks that they avoid killing bears accompanied by cubs and that they return any collars.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-07 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Funding for special ed in CT got a bump this year, but is it enough?",Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/07/ct-special-education-funding-2025/,"CT injected $70 million more for special education, but it isn't enough to meet many districts' needs. Officials are trying to fill the gaps.","Lisa Balzano’s recent visit to a Fairfield high school left her floored by one sight in particular: a supply room stocked with almost anything a teacher would need. 
“She opened this room with supplies, and I almost fell over,” Balzano recalled. “I said, ‘What’s this?’”
Balzano is a special education teacher at Bridgeport Military Academy, where she buys her own tissues, pens, pencils, markers and more. Anything she needs, she purchases — except for paper. Teachers are allocated two reams a month. 
“That was a year or two ago, and it’s still embedded in my brain how it was just Fairfield,” Balzano said. “It’s 10 minutes from where I live, and it’s just completely different.”
As a Bridgeport educator working in special education for nearly 20 years, Balzano is no stranger to shortages. A position went unfilled last school year, and Balzano’s caseload jumped from 25 students to around 40 students. While it was normal for her, Balzano said she’s heard that other towns consider a caseload of 25 students high.
Special education programs across the state have been historically underfunded, and some urban districts like Bridgeport and New Britain — as well as smaller rural districts, like Thompson — have struggled especially to support their special education students because of lower teacher pay or limited access to resources.
Statewide, special education accounts for a large portion of district budgets. From 2023 to 2024, districts in the state spent, on average, almost a quarter of their total expenditures on special education.
Earlier this year, in a move many educators said was long overdue, Gov. Ned Lamont and the state legislature injected an additional $70 million into special education. Of that, $40 million was allocated as an emergency grant for the fiscal year that ended June 30 and $30 million went toward a new grant for fiscal year 2026. But this money still isn’t nearly enough to meet the needs in many districts, and officials are working to fill in the gaps.
Spending is high, but students are struggling
Some districts spend over 30% of their annual budgets on special education. But such high levels of spending don’t necessarily mean students are getting what they need. 
When a district can’t meet a student’s level of need, that student may be sent to a school in another district or placed in a private school or facility. But this has historically been very costly for districts.
The costs are due to a variety of factors, said Michael Morton, deputy executive director of operations and communications for the School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy organization.
“When you have historically underfunded districts, they’re not going to have the resources to build in-district programming,” Morton said. “As a result of that, you are going to have a lot more students being sent out of district, which results in increased costs.”
And that raises other costs, Morton said. “You’re also paying for transportation to make sure those students get to a place where they can get the services that they deserve and are legally entitled to.”
Districts statewide spent around $268 million on transportation for all special education students in the 2023-24 school year and just under $700 million on tuition.
Michele McKinley, who heads up special education for Bridgeport schools, said the district outplaces anywhere between 250 and 300 students — which comes with a high cost.
“Out-of-district placement may cost $200,000, and that’s on the low end. Well, we don’t get $200,000 per student,” McKinley said, referring to state funding. “So then that’s additional funds that we have to go into the general budget to pull to ensure that we are meeting that student’s needs. Because ultimately, we have to meet the individual student’s needs.”
“There just aren’t the funds to support the legal requirements. And that’s a real problem.”Andrew Feinstein, attorney
Bridgeport faced significant teacher shortages last year, with 24 special education teacher vacancies and 46 paraeducator vacancies, according to a complaint filed in June by the Center for Children’s Advocacy. The complaint detailed allegations from families who said their children regressed due to inadequate staffing of educators with no special education training. 
One student was allowed, on multiple occasions, to hit their head against a wall hundreds of times, according to the complaint. 
McKinley said the district has already begun addressing issues in the complaint.
Bridgeport is in a better position this upcoming school year, with only three special education teacher vacancies as of Aug. 15, according to Bridgeport Public Schools. McKinley said “a lot of intentional work” went into recruiting and retention initiatives.
But funding disparities mean some districts face steeper challenges than others. Districts in Connecticut get around 57% of their education funding from local property taxes, according to the School and State Finance Project. That means more affluent towns tend to have more money to spend on education. 
Both New Britain and Greenwich put around 27% of their total education expenditures towards special education in 2023-24, a bit above the state-wide average of 23.7%. But taking into account each town’s tax revenues, and the number of students they serve, there was a more-than $20,000 disparity between New Britain and Greenwich in per-pupil expenditures for students in special education. 
Greenwich spent over $50,800 per special education student, while New Britain spent $25,686 per special education student.
In Bridgeport, where Balzano works, nearly 30% of all education expenditures went towards special education; That amounted to $28,081 per pupil in special education. 
Some less affluent districts — that can’t provide the qualified staff or infrastructure required by law for special education students — spend millions of dollars to send students to schools outside the district.
Outplacements strain Bridgeport’s budget significantly, McKinley said. But the district is currently building a new facility for students with “complex learning needs” that would house around 260 students. She said she hopes this will save the district money and provide students with the services they need.
 If special education costs exceed what the district has budgeted, McKinley said they have to tap into funds that are intended to cover other things. 
“That’s the importance of the new facility that we’re building, it’s to provide some of those services where we have had to send students out of district — to provide those services in district.” McKinley said.

Like most things, special education has gotten more expensive
Special education costs have risen steeply in recent years for districts across the country. In Connecticut, the number of special education students has steadily increased despite an overall decline in statewide enrollment.
Andrew Feinstein, a special education attorney, said districts statewide are struggling to hire educators. The state Department of Education has also highlighted the problem. This shortage is exacerbated in districts that offer less-competitive salaries, typically lower-income districts.
“Cost, of course, escalated enormously in special ed,” Feinstein said. “We are reaching the real area of scarcity, where there just aren’t the funds to support the legal requirements. And that’s a real problem.”
Six years ago, districts were putting a smaller portion — closer to 20% — of education expenditures towards special education. Districts now are dishing out over 25%. And students are still struggling.

Naomi Nova is involved in the special education system as a parent, special education attorney and as the vice president of Special Education Equity for Kids of Connecticut, or SEEK. Nova came face-to-face with the impacts of staff shortages after a recent planning and placement team meeting. (Nova wanted to clarify that at this meeting, the board was not represented by an attorney.)
In the parking lot, as she was leaving, Nova was approached by one of the evaluators.
“It wasn’t a confrontational meeting at all, but she came up to me in tears after the meeting, grabbed me in the parking lot and told me that there were so many more assessments and things that she wanted to recommend and do to help students, and that she couldn’t do it because her number of evaluations that she was now expected to do was so high that there just weren’t enough hours in the day,” Nova said.
Nova said families sometimes seek supplemental support for their children outside of the school system, but that can present financial challenges.
“These are huge expenses, and they’re huge expenses for any family,” Nova said. “But for people who can’t afford it, it’s truly devastating.”
What’s the state doing?
The Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation creating additional grants to fund special education during the 2025 legislative session in an effort to help districts, their students and staff.
The bill passed in June included the creation of the Special Education Expansion and Development (SEED) grant that will allocate $60 million over the next two fiscal years, or $30 million a year. The general assembly also approved a High Quality Special Education Incentives grant to allocate $9.9 million in FY 2027 among other initiatives targeted at managing costs in special education.
If the grant were fully funded — which it is not — it would allocate over $190 million across the state. Under the current allocation, it provides a few less-populated towns with just a few hundred dollars for the year. 
“I don’t think anyone would say it is [a magical solution],” Morton, of the School and State Finance Project, said. “But it is a step in the right direction to hopefully making sure that we have a special education system that is not only well funded but is making sure that every student is getting the services that they are legally entitled to.”
Before the creation of the SEED grant, state special education funding was primarily distributed through two grants: the Excess Cost grant and the Education Cost Sharing grant. The Excess Cost grant is a high-cost service funding grant that partially reimburses districts for the cost of some special education students. To cover additional special education costs, districts pull money from the state’s general education funding, distributed under the Education Cost Sharing grant.

Connecticut is one of the only states in the nation that did not distribute state funding for special education through a dedicated formula prior to FY 2026.
Districts can request reimbursement through the Excess Cost grant for the cost of students exceeding the basic contribution, or when a student’s education costs over 4.5 times the district’s average expenditure per student from the prior year.
The grant also fully reimburses districts for students requiring special education services placed by the state. This includes students who may be attending an out-of-district school because of a foster care placement. 

But these grants don’t typically meet districts’ needs, leaving local school systems to pay the difference. For districts, this creates what Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut Education Association, calls a “disaster in local budgeting.”
“You’re talking about some districts having to make up three, four, five million dollars because the Excess Cost grants were only funded to 60%,” Dias said. “You had the federal government not meeting its obligation, the state not meeting its obligation, but the services have to be provided and then paid for at the local level, causing these incredible pressures.” 
That’s led districts like Bridgeport to place special education students in costly private schools. A federal report from 2023 found that Connecticut outplaced 6.3% of all special education students — the highest rate in the nation.
Some students require district outplacement for their learning needs, but many need mid-tier interventions they can’t get in their districts. With the newly approved SEED grant, and additional future funding, Dias is hopeful districts can create collaborative centers for students to receive “the lowest level of intervention with the highest level of impact.” 
“These ideas of regional centers are going to have to take root in some capacity,” Dias said. “We can’t afford to continuously outsource special education. We’re going to have to figure out, how do we create something different?” 
A new approach
That “something different” may look unconventional on the outside — like the Farmington Valley Diagnostic Center. 
The center, directed by Sara Steinberg, is a temporary school for 6th through 12th graders located in a small one-story building in Simsbury. The goal of the school isn’t to keep students enrolled — rather, it seeks to send them back to their home districts.
Overseen by the Capitol Region Education Council, the FVDC allows member districts to purchase a certain number of seats at the beginning of the school year at a much lower cost than conventional private outplacements. 
Steinberg said memberships cost “far less” than what a conventional outplacement would cost since the center is not looking to make a profit.
Steinberg said FVDC is “scrappy,” transforming closets into reboot rooms with pillows and calming lights for students and bringing in community members with service dogs to interact with students weekly — for free. The school, which has been open since 1998, recently purchased new furniture for the first time in the history of the center.
Around half of the students at FVDC have reached a point where they are refusing to attend school in their home district, and many have undergone severe trauma, Steinberg said. The goal of the center is to realign and reset students in a standard 8- to 12-week period placement. Steinberg has seen countless success stories from students who leave the center and return to their home districts.
“Our systems are not always set up for early intervention, unfortunately, but this is actually an example of earlier intervention,” Steinberg said. “It’s an opportunity to do something in a supportive, proactive way and seeing then what the next step is.” 
Sometimes, students are still sent to outplacement programs if they can’t return to their district. But the program offers a step before outplacement that many districts, especially smaller districts, don’t have the bandwidth to offer, Steinberg said.
“I do think if we can create these smaller settings within larger settings, there’s a place for that,” Steinberg said, adding that SEED grant funding could bolster that effort. 
We can’t afford to continuously outsource special education. We’re going to have to figure out, how do we create something different?”Kate Dias, Connecticut Education Association
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, co-sponsored the bill that provided for SEED grants during this year’s legislative session, and he said it’s a good opportunity to fund intervention to support students with lower-levels of need.
“So this is hopefully an incentive for communities to come together and say, ‘Can we pool our resources and educate some of these kids instead of sending them to other places where it’s more expensive?’” Ritter said. 
In addition to Bridgeport’s announcement of its new school tailored to special education students, Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti has said he wants to open a regional special education school. 
Morton said he believes the special education bills passed may allow districts to consider expanding resources. “People are more likely to consider — because of the additional funds that are being provided and the additional incentives — [creating] in-district or multidistrict programming, rather than relying on outplacing students,” Morton said.
The SEED grant won’t solve all the problems in special education in Connecticut, but, Ritter said, “You’ve got to take a step to walk a mile.”
Not a ‘magical fix’
As the staffing shortage continues, educators like Balzano see the impacts of underfunding each day. Statewide teacher shortages are exacerbated in less affluent districts because of lower incomes, fewer resources and larger class sizes and caseloads.
When Balzano had around 40 students on her caseload, she not only had to fill out paperwork for each of the students, she also had to teach them.
“I was spread very, very thin,” she said. “And I heard some teachers stay at school till 8:00 at night. I just can’t do that. I can’t and I won’t do that.”
Balzano was able to get her work done and not stay late because of an agreement established through the Bridgeport Education Association and the Bridgeport Board of Education that allowed educators to get coverage for classes if they needed additional time to finish paperwork. Even though the vacant position is now filled, Balzano said there is still a lot of teacher turnover in the district, and people often leave for higher paying positions in the state.
But Balzano said she’s dedicated to her Bridgeport school. 
“The students need somebody that they know will stay, because I think they’re so used to a transient teacher and staff population. I think there’s a comfort to know that that teacher or staff member will always be there,” she said. 
Balzano, who only had one other job before working in Bridgeport, said this is “it” for her.
“I can’t really imagine doing anything else, and I just love working with the kids and their families,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0820_SR_SpecialEd_048-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-07 05:57:07.636046

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)As the end of summer approaches the grass in the front yard has gone to seed. The flowery heads sag with the promise of new life and sway like a murmur in the evening breeze. It won’t be long before some city fire department employee comes along in a little white pickup, hops out, and measures the grass with a ruler to find that some patches are above the 8-inch legal maximum.
Then a wooden stake will be pounded into the yard with a cardstock notice written in Sharpie giving me a few days in which to cut the grass or face fines and the threat that the city will cut it for me and bill me for the bother.
But the grass is hardly a nuisance, not yet, so it remains uncut, at least for today. Lawns are also environmental disasters. They limit biodiversity, take too much watering, and are generally made of nonnative grass. They’re also an indicator of class status, a signal that you have the leisure time to care for a lawn or the means to have somebody do it for you. And yes, the grass can be a fire hazard if it’s too tall and close to a building. That’s why the fire department measures it with rulers.
I’m tempted to replace the lawn with native plants.
But there’s been too much activity on Constitution Street in the past month with little time for lawn care or native landscaping. Empty paint cans are piled like empty beer cans on the porch and the tracks from a bucket truck are still visible in the damp yard. My guy doing the painting used the bucket to reach some of the highest peaks of the many gabled roof, part of the design of a house that was built before the phrase “world war” was in our vocabulary. It is an elaborate roof for such a small home, with some of the extant gingerbread between the gables reminding me more of a steamboat than a house. The water has been deep enough in the front yard during the rains of the past month that the old house has seemed like a ship laid up in strange waters. This port of call has been the summer of 2025.
The end of summer always finds me in a reflective mood. There’s just over two weeks left before autumn arrives — it officially begins at 1:19 p.m. Sept. 22 — so I have an urge to get things done. The painting will be finished in a week, if it doesn’t rain too much, but there’s still some carpentry work to do. I’ll tackle that myself, and will be glad to use some of the skills passed down by my father. I’ll leave the plumbing repairs to a professional, although I’ll hear my amateur handyman father whispering behind me that I should be doing it myself. He’s been dead 27 years, but he comes to me in my dreams, never speaking but always with a red metal toolbox and the need to repair something — a car, a door, a water heater.
I know that repairs aren’t really about fixing objects. What my subconscious is manifesting, other than a longing for a dead parent, is a desire to confront challenges, to bring order to chaos, to heal the tribulation of the summer nearly past and the years immediately preceding it.
Sometimes I’ll wake with a start before dawn, my T-shirt soaked with sweat, staring into the darkness and pondering the latest home repair dream. When I can’t get back to sleep, I’ll come downstairs in the quiet house and turn on the lamp behind my writing desk and pull down a volume from the bookshelf. This last episode of unscheduled nocturnal reading happened a couple of nights ago, and the book I reached for was published in 1940. “Rascals in Democracy” was written by W.G. Clugston, a newspaper reporter whose beat was the Kansas Statehouse. While it is ostensibly about politics in the Sunflower State, it’s really about politics everywhere.
Clugston was 50 years old when the book was published and was the kind of reporter Hecht and MacArthur wrote plays about. He was cynical, somebody who saw how the sausage was made, and didn’t shy from telling others the stomach-turning details. He didn’t have much regard for William Allen White, the legendary newspaper editor from Emporia, saying that White could have become a great literary figure if he had not soiled his talents in the “dirty sewer lines of politics.”
Other figures, from Gov. Harry H. Woodring to 1936 presidential hopeful Alf Landon, were similarly dismissed as opportunists. About the only Kansas politician Clugston seemed to like was Arthur Capper, and even then the approval was qualified. Capper, he says, built his publishing empire through classified advertisements in his magazines hawking hoax remedies for impotence to his predominately rural readership.
Clugston was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and graduated with a law degree from the university there. But instead of practicing law he pursued journalism, working for United Press International and the Democratic-leaning Kansas City Post. Once, while covering the Kansas Statehouse for the Post, he was locked in a room and held incommunicado.
At 3:30 a.m. March 17, 1921, officials discovered him hiding in the secretary of state’s office, adjacent to the Senate, while lawmakers met in closed session to debate appointments to a variety of state offices, including bank examiner.
“He was asked (after being hauled before the Senate) to give his promise to refrain from disclosing anything he had heard of the debate on the appointments,” the Wichita Beacon reported. “He refused. As a result he was ordered imprisoned in one of the adjacent committee rooms, where he will remain under the eye of a sergeant-at-arms until the session ends.”
Clugston’s detention lasted until sine die adjournment, 11 hours later.
His first-hand observation of Statehouse politics persuaded him that most politicians were “rascals.” He may have settled on the word because it was a colorful and relatively safe description that did not make an accusation he would have to defend in court.
But Clugston knew how to make a point with humor.
“Scientists have never established, with any degree of accuracy, just how long it takes to produce an outstanding rascal under any form of government,” he wrote. “Nor does history provide much basis for computing the length of time it takes for an individual, or a succession of individuals, to corrupt a state. But Kansas has produced some factual material which might prove useful to statisticians interested in trying to calculate the time elements likely to be involved in such undertakings.”
The ingredients included social snobbery, rampant ambition, the shameless exploitation of family connections, and wrapping oneself in a hypocritical cloak of patriotism and purity. Clugston seems to have envisioned the era of Trump even before our current rascal-in-chief was born.
Clugston believed the long-term fix for the dismal state of politics was education, and for education to be effective teachers had to be liberated from political dogma and be adequately paid. Teachers, he said, were “terrorized” into teaching what benefited the ruling elite instead of spreading enlightenment. Trump? Check.
“The teachers are not to blame for anything except their very human yielding to the urge to keep body and soul together by earning their daily bread through their chosen profession,” Clugston wrote. “But until we really have an educational system that educates, and until the teachers are emancipated and freed from the economic straight-jackets which they are now required to wear, democracy will always be weak in one of its most important understructures.”
Clugston had an unshakeable belief that the people were, if not smarter than their politicians, at least motivated by a desire to express their collective will for good. This seems old-fashioned now, but when “Rascals in Democracy” was released, Britain was already at war with Nazi Germany over the invasion of Poland. The storm clouds were hard to miss, even from across the Atlantic.
This belief in the essential good of the populace was as American as Norman Rockwell, and perhaps as naïve. But Clugston believed in it earnestly, just as he did in a particular form of Christianity, one rooted in civic service. Clugston was also a joiner of things, including a Topeka club founded by Karl Menninger called “The Naked and Unashamed Club.” No, it wasn’t that kind of group. Dedicated to philosophical discussion, the members put their inhibitions aside for open and freewheeling debate.
The book I now hold in my hand is personally signed by Clugston, in the flowing script of a fountain pen. “To my good Irish friend Ed Rooney, whom I love but with whom I can’t agree about anything.” It’s dated June 5, 1940, at Topeka.
Rooney was a Topeka lawyer, a professor at the Washburn University School of Law, and a fellow member of the Naked and Unashamed. In 1942, he and Clugston debated “campaign issues” at Kansas State University at Manhattan, at the invitation of the college’s department of journalism. If there remains a transcript of that debate I would pay cash money for it.
Clugston died in 1963. He was 78. The Associated Press attributed his death to cancer. His literary death, precipitated by a decline in his influence after World War II, was due to neglect. The kind of radicals that flourished in Kansas during the 1920s, including the entire “Appeal to Reason” socialist contingent out of Girard, were crushed by the post-war Red Scare.
If Clugston is remembered at all now, it is as a footnote in a dissertation.
I first came across Clugston years ago while examining some “Little Blue Books” published by Emanuel Haldeman-Julius at the Appeal offices in Girard. Clugston’s “Facts You Should Know About Kansas” came out in 1946.
While I don’t agree with Clugston on everything — his assessment of White was wrong, if only because he was Mary White’s father — I am richer for having read his contrarian view of Kansas politics. There are more things in heaven and Topeka than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
As we near the end of summer, things become clearer on reflection. Our political summer has lasted for some eight decades, a period when those Americans who had fought the rise of fascism endeavored to make a better world using the tools they had. The result wasn’t perfect, especially in an age when a phrase like “world war” was needed, but it was progress.
Now we face a domestic threat to democracy.
One of the tools missing from our citizen toolbox is the ability to have rational and deep debates on the challenges inherent in democracy. Can we recover from a misstep when nobody has yet emerged to galvanize the resistance? How do we engage with our countrymen who reject constitutional democracy in favor of theocracy, oligarchy, or outright dictatorship?
Protest is important. Many thousands have taken to the streets in Topeka and across the county to decry the growing police state and other presidential abuses of power. Their signs and voices express the desire for change. We need protest, but we also need reasoned dissent.
Instead of engaging in informed conversations we hide behind memes, buzzwords, and taunts. So do our politicians. We reject the principled argument in favor of the endorphin rush of manufactured outrage. So do our politicians. This is not righteous outrage, not the kind of outrage over real events that drives movements, but the gossamer constructs of online manipulation.
If there is one lesson I’ve taken from Clugston the forgotten, it’s this:
Thank God for dissent. It is the seed from which democracy grows.
He didn’t say that, but he lived it. And his dissent was informed, insightful, and hurled like a spitball at his targets. He wrote books and signed them to friends who disagreed. He was cranky and colorful and even a bit reckless — can you imagine what the current Kansas Senate would do to a reporter who hid himself to hear a closed-door discussion? — but Clug, as his friends called him, was the genuine article.
This is the kind of thing I ponder when I wake before dawn, with just a couple of weeks of summer left, and reach for an old book on the shelf. In the dreams with my father we never really finish our repairs. The tasks change, but we’re always in the midst of it, using the tools we have. It is the nature of maintenance, whether for a car or a hot water heater or the house of democracy.

Traffic deaths down slightly: On a hopeful note, only 143 highway deaths have been tallied in our state as of mid-August… hopeful, compared to 196 deaths by the same time last year. Credit should go to the state and local police departments for cracking down on reckless drivers and speeders. But of some concern, there’s been an increase in fatalities and injuries involving e-bikes as new laws regarding their operation take effect Oct. 1.
Using A.I. to keep highways safe: It’s been a while since we’ve had a wrong-way crash on our interstates and parkways, thanks in part to artificial intelligence (A.I.). The Connecticut Department of Transportation has installed tech at 150 on- and off-ramps looking for people as they enter the highway in the wrong direction, setting off flashing lights and alerting the State Police.
Higher fares on trains: As predicted, fares on all of our trains went up 5% as of Sept. 1. What a nice way to welcome back commuters! And another 5% jump is coming next July. Bus fares were not affected.
Work from home: Higher rail fares (with the same slow service) and unending traffic are other reasons more than 17% of Connecticut residents chose to work remotely. In some towns the numbers are much higher: 39% of Weston residents and 36% in Westport.
Nextgen Acela: Years late, the nifty new Acela trains started running between Boston and Washington on Aug. 28. Train fan that I am, I saw it run past on it’s debut run… already 12 minutes late. Though they’re capable of 160 mph, they run no faster (and sometimes slower) than Metro-North. Congestion and delays affect even Amtrak’s flagship trainsets. Kind of like putting a Maserati on I-95 at rush hour.
Back in the Metroliner days, Amtrak offered partial fare refunds if your train was 15 minutes late. Last Tuesday’s Next-Gen Acela train (9-2-25) was 30 minutes late into Stamford and 45 minutes late into Washington D.C. If your train is two-plus hours late you have to contact customer relations to plead your case.
Spirit Airlines chapter 11 – take 2: The ultra-low-cost airline has filed for bankruptcy again, just months after emerging from its last filing in 2024. The airline blames financial and operational difficulties: underwhelming demand, excess flight capacity, mounting debt and high operating costs. For now, Spirit plans to continue flying out of Bradley airport.
Shipping BUI: The captain of the 100,000-ton container ship MSC Jubilee IX was arrested last month by the Coast Guard and charged with operating a ship while under the influence. When the Seattle harbor pilot boarded he said he smelled a strong odor of alcohol and called the authorities. The captain said it was just his mouthwash, but a breathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol of 0.25, six times the legal limit.
Amazingly, local laws call this only a misdemeanor with a $1,000 fine. But the captain undoubtedly faces severe consequences. The ship continued its journey without him.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wrong-way-driving-hero.jpg,,,2025-09-07 04:56:49.078106

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Investigate Midwest)CEDAR RAPIDS – Few people outside Quaker Oats know exactly what the Cedar Rapids factory is making when a sweet, wholesome smell wafts from the plant north of downtown.
Locals call it a Crunch Berry day because Quaker – the world’s largest cereal plant – makes Cap’n Crunch’s Crunch Berries, but the aroma could also be oats roasting for Oatmeal Squares or maple-flavored instant oatmeal.
The oats fueling that sweet-smelling goodness come not from the rich Iowa soil near the plant, but from up to 1,000 miles away in Canada. For decades, the plumpest, most consistent oats came from the northern plains, but new field trials show food-grade oats can be grown in Iowa and Minnesota by farmers eager for an alternative to corn and soybeans.
Buying domestic oats would help Quaker save freight costs and avoid threatened tariffs on Canadian goods. It could also improve Midwest water quality and soil health ravaged by an endless corn/soy rotation. Expanding Midwest oat production offers economic and environmental benefits for farmers and local communities, advocates say.

But agricultural companies and commodity groups don’t have financial incentives tied to oats because oats don’t require hybrid seeds, crop insurance or as much fertilizer. These big players aren’t opposing oats, but they aren’t cheerleading either.
The lack of support has left oat growers to be their own hype machines.
“We can actually pick our varieties and our production practices to provide a better product than Canada, not only on a protein level, but on an environmental impact level,” said Landon Plagge, a Latimer farmer and oat advocate.
In May, Plagge and other oat farmers in Iowa and Minnesota loaded 100,000 bushels of their oats into a rail car bound for Quaker’s factory in Cedar Rapids. Three months later, they’re still waiting to hear what the grain giant thought of the domestic product.
Iowa is a ‘donut hole’ for oat research
Baby boomers who grew up on Iowa farms remember growing oats to feed horses and other livestock. Iowans harvested more than 6 million acres of oats a year until the 1950s, according to Matt Liebman, an emeritus Iowa State University agronomy professor.
But as Americans started eating more meat, demand increased for corn to feed the cattle, hogs and chickens. When ethanol was approved as a fuel additive in the 1970s, corn demand rose again. Now, about 45% of corn nationwide becomes ethanol.
Like kernels around a cob, industries popped up to serve King Corn. Specialty seed breeders, co-ops that sell fertilizer and consultants who tell farmers how much corn to feed their hogs all benefit from expansion of corn acres.
Still, Iowans harvested nearly 40,000 acres of oats for grain in 2022, putting it eighth in the nation behind North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, according to the Census of Agriculture. Oats harvested to feed animals and humans increased 12.6% in Iowa between 2017 and 2022.


Iowa State University, a land-grant school with a powerhouse agriculture college, once had a distinguished oat breeding program. Kenneth Frey and J. Artie Browning developed a crown rust-resistant oat cultivar they shared with farmers as certified seed in 1968, according to the Agronomy Department’s 125th Points of Pride.
But Iowa State hasn’t had an oat breeder since 2007 and doesn’t do its own oat trials. The university did partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa, a sustainable agriculture nonprofit based in Des Moines, to hold oat trials at four ISU research farms.
“Iowa is the donut hole,” Liebman said, referring to oat research in neighboring states of Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Illinois.
Liebman, who retired in 2021, understands university budgets are tight and there’s no corporate constituency clamoring for oat research.
“There’s more money to be made in selling corn and soybeans,” he said, referring to ag companies. “With oats, you don’t have to keep buying seed every year because it’s not hybrid and it’s not transgenic. It’s much less lucrative.”
He’d like to see ISU prioritize research of oats and other small grains because of the benefits to soil health and water quality.
Glen Ritchie, who started as ISU’s Agronomy Department chair in July, said he knows there is renewed interest in oats among Iowa farmers and that might affect research priorities.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to provide the best value we can to the agricultural community in Iowa,” he said. “Oats are part of the discussions we’re having on that.”

He’s seen it happen 
Martin Larsen dipped his toe into small-grains farming in 2018, planting oats on a small swath of his farm near Byron, Minnesota. He was curious. Would his combine work for oat harvest? Could he get at least 38 pounds per bushel – the minimum threshold for food-grade oats?
The answers were yes and yes.
“I ramped up from there to the point I have a full three-crop rotation on 1,400 acres,” he said.
Larsen has even invested in specialized equipment, including a header for his combine that strips the seeds from the top of the oat plant rather than running the whole stalk through the machine. This speeds harvest and keeps the stalk in place to reduce erosion.
Other farmers want to know whether Larsen is making money from oats.
“It’s always the thing we hear,” he said. “Soybeans, especially, can see an up to 10% yield bump because you’ve broken up the crop rotation.”
Glyphosate-resistant water hemp vexes every Midwest corn farmer. When the weed wants to make its move in late spring, oats already have a lush green cover and the water hemp can’t compete. That means less weed pressure during the next corn round and less pesticide he has to apply, Larsen said.
By planting red clover with the oats, the clover provides nitrogen to the soil, which feeds future corn crops with reduced fertilizer costs, he said.
“So you really start to put all this together and it’s looking like the right thing for my farm,” he said.
It’s also the right thing for protecting water quality, said Larsen, who is a conservation and feed lot technician for the Olmsted County Soil and Water Conservation District. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has asked Minnesota to develop a plan for reducing nitrate pollution to groundwater in southeastern Minnesota’s Driftless region.
Nitrate in drinking water not only can cause blue baby syndrome, but studies – including some done in Iowa – show a link between ingesting nitrate from drinking water and cancers including colorectal, thyroid, bladder and ovarian.
“We have to raise something different than corn and soybeans or raise corn and soybeans differently if we’re going to affect nitrates,” Larsen said. “We have hundreds and hundreds of data points of groundwater samples below oats compared to corn and soybeans, and it’s black and white that oats will reduce nitrates in groundwater.”
Tests of groundwater under Larsen’s oat acres show up to 60% less nitrate than under corn acres.

Farmers band together
While running a grocery store in Latimer for eight years, Anne and Landon Plagge were always thinking about what customers wanted to buy.
“We were on vacation in Europe and we saw the proliferation of oat products on the shelves there,” Landon Plagge said. “Our (U.S.) consumer patterns tend to mirror that.”
The global market for oat milk was valued at more than $2 billion in 2020 and is projected to climb through at least 2028, especially with new shelf-stable milk. Beyond oat milk, there is oat flour for people trying to avoid gluten, and oatmeal boosted with flax and chia for people trying to get more protein.
Plagge decided he wanted to grow oats for the segment of the U.S. population that wants an allergen-free, pesticide-free product. Grain Millers processes oats in St. Ansgar, near the Minnesota border, but they grind wheat and barley, too, so the oats can’t be completely free of allergens, Plagge said.
He recruited about 70 farmers, mostly from Iowa and Minnesota, to invest in Green Acres Milling, a $55 million oat-processing plant in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The plant, scheduled to open next year, eventually will process 3 million bushels of oats a year. This equates to about 60,000 acres of oats within three years, Plagge said.
“They put their own cash into making the mill a reality,” Plagge said of the investors – including Larsen – who will get a premium price for the oats they sell to Green Acres. The mill requires oat growers to use a cover crop and to grow oats as part of a rotation with other crops.
“That gives us the control of the raw materials supply coming in so we can provide a sustainably-produced oat with a cover crop for our brands and a diverse rotation for our brands,” Plagge said.

Who’s buying?
While Quaker is several generations removed from its 1870’s origin in Ravenna, Ohio, Seven Sundays founders Hannah and Brady Barnstable sold their first bag of muesli – like granola, but healthier – at a Minneapolis farmers market in 2011.
“We love oats,” Brady Barnstable said. “We think they are a huge unlock to change the agricultural landscape in the Midwest.”
Seven Sundays makes cereal and granola without dyes, artificial colors, allergens or refined sugars. They also buy only non-GMO crops grown without glyphosate. Their products, like Wildberry Protein Oats, have muscled their way onto grocery shelves, including at Midwest Costco stores.
“We’ve been invited to the Costco Midwest managers meetings in the Chicago area to give presentations on what we’re doing in our supply chain to benefit soil health,” Barnstable said. But Costco wouldn’t stock Seven Sundays just for environmental brownie points, he said. “The decisions are driven by sales. Is it resonating with their shoppers? For Seven Sundays, it is.”
Seven Sundays originally bought all its oats from Whole Grain Milling, in Welcome, Minnesota, but as they sold more muesli and cereal, Seven Sundays needed more suppliers, including some from Canada. By purchasing American oats, the company could avoid increased freight costs and skip tariff fears.
“Our goal is to source as close to home as possible for all our ingredients,” Barnstable said. “I have heard that this new mill will have the capacity to provide us and many other customers with the oats we need to fill our full demand.”

Public push for sustainable products
But what about Quaker? The company and its parent, PepsiCo Inc., did not respond to several attempts to seek comment for this story. Just like Quaker doesn’t advertise what makes that sweet smell in Cedar Rapids, the firm isn’t saying exactly what factors into their oat sourcing.
But we know price and availability of supplies are key drivers, according to PepsiCo’s 2024 Annual Report.
“Risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers,” the report stated.
Companies face pressure from consumers – particularly Millennials and Gen Z – who increasingly want to buy products that are good for people and the planet. A 2024 survey by PwC showed consumers are willing to spend almost 10% more for sustainably-sourced or produced goods.
PepsiCo and Cargill announced in July they will partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa to advance regenerative farming practices across 240,000 acres in Iowa. Farmers who sell their corn to Cargill – which produces ingredients for PepsiCo’s family of companies – will have access to advice, technical resources and incentive payments to “support their transition to regenerative practices,” the companies said in a joint news release.
Cargill and PepsiCo want to drive adoption of regenerative practices on 10 million acres by 2030, the news release said.
News like this brings equal parts frustration and hope for Larsen, the Minnesota oat farmer waiting to hear back from Quaker about the May oat shipment. “It seems like buying oats from their backyard would fit their narrative.”

(Provided by American Prairie)American Prairie announced this week it has acquired the Anchor Ranch, its second-largest land purchase to date, and it has reopened access to nearly 50,000 acres of public land in “a special area of the Breaks.”
“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure an important piece of ecologically and culturally significant land,” said American Prairie CEO Alison Fox in a statement. “But this acquisition is equally important as a way to return public access to the people so they can explore, hunt and recreate on land that’s been off limits for many years.”
American Prairie launched in 2001 with a mission to ensure 3.2 million acres of prairie are protected, including roughly half that are already part of the Charlie M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge and the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.
“But it’s important to point out that the majority of that would be — is — public land,” said American Prairie public relations manager Beth Saboe.

The new land comprises the Anchor Ranch and two additional properties in Blaine County, and it puts the total acreage American Prairie manages at 600,000, according to a news release announcing the acquisitions.
Anchor Ranch is 69 miles southwest of Havre and totals 67,960 acres, including 22,837 acres of deeded land and 45,123 of leased acres, “significantly advancing the organization’s mission of prairie ecosystem conservation,” American Prairie said.
It also opens up access to land previously tied up in a legal dispute along with Bullwhacker Road, which the Public Land Water Access Association described as “the only reasonable access” to acreage in the Breaks.
But a judge found the road was private in 2011.
In 2012, the billionaire Wilks brothers, among the largest land owners in Montana, bought the ranch. It was caught up in a controversial negotiation with the Bureau of Land Management, then put on the market again in 2022, according to a timeline from Lee Enterprises.
In its announcement about the new properties, American Prairie said a 3.8 mile section of Bullwhacker Road will be open to the public, providing access to nearly 50,000 acres of public land that have been a point of dispute and embroiled in lawsuits for years.
In a statement, Fox said the organization is proud to provide more permanent access to “this special area of the Breaks.”
“While we will take some time to develop a comprehensive public access plan for this new property, the previously private stretch of Bullwhacker Road is now officially open to the public,” Fox said.
Randy Newberg, founder of Fresh Tracks and Hunt Talk media, also praised the acquisition, especially for hunters.
“This is a win for anyone who cares about public access to our shared lands,” said Newberg in a statement provided by American Prairie. “Our audience cares deeply about the Bullwhacker Allotment as it touts exceptional habitat and opportunities to hunt. It’s an area that’s both important to protect and for the public to access.”
American Prairie has been controversial in Montana.
Some farmers and ranchers have opposed its purchases of land as detrimental to agriculture and beef production. Political leaders, including Gov. Greg Gianforte and Attorney General Austin Knudsen, have opposed grazing by bison, reintroduced there in 2020 after being gone for 120 years, according to American Prairie.
But some former critics have started coming around, Saboe said. She pointed to an online forum where hunters are active, and one poster recently said they used to be on the “Save the Cowboy” side but appreciate the public access from American Prairie — and time will tell.
American Prairie broke a visitation record in 2024 for the seventh year in a row, the news release said. It saw 6,600 overnight visitors and more than 5,000 at its National Discovery Center in Lewistown.
In 2024, 56.6% of the bookings were from Montanans, but people from every state besides five — Hawaii, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Louisiana and West Virginia — were in the books, Saboe said.
One group came from Germany, many come from Washington and California, and many also visit from the Midwest, Saboe said.
Prairie land takes a long time to restore, but American Prairie sees signs of ecological hardiness, Saboe said.
The bison herd is healthy; cameras have caught images of rarely seen animals, such as badgers; and swift foxes, reintroduced on the bordering Fort Belknap Indian Community, are migrating onto American Prairie public lands, Saboe said.
Next month, American Prairie marks its 20th year of having bison, and Saboe said it’s a big milestone. She also said the animals are doing their jobs, living their lives in a way that supports other creatures.
They graze at varying levels, giving the prairie “a bad haircut,” but one that allows a large variety of birds to nest and find protection, Saboe said. She said migrating birds can spend as much as a month on a prairie stopover in the midst of their long trips.
The bison also wallow, or roll around in the dirt, and the depressions they create often fill with water and help insects, frogs and other amphibians thrive and reproduce, Saboe said. They also offer drinking water for birds.
The news release said American Prairie acquired 1,888 deeded acres adjacent to the south side of Anchor ranch. And in a third and separate transaction in the Cow Creek basin of Blaine County, the organization acquired an additional 5,401 acres.
“This property is located in the northern portion of the Breaks and extends American Prairie’s shared fenceline with the Fort Belknap Indian Community,” the news release said.
These three acquisitions bring American Prairie’s total habitat base to 603,657 acres, which comprises 167,070 deeded acres and 436,587 leased public acres.
In the news release, American Prairie said the new properties offer important wildlife habitat for elk, deer, pronghorn and upland birds, and they provide connectivity through the Monument to the CMR and north to the Bears Paw and Little Rockies ranges.
American Prairie said it intends to share a more detailed public access plan in the future to detail recreational uses on the new deeded acres, although it will first take time to familiarize itself with the land.
On both the Anchor Ranch and the 5,401-acre property with public grazing leases, the ranching families who lease the properties will remain in place, and the land will continue to be used for agricultural production, the news release said.
“We are really pleased to have the existing lessees stay on the ground where their cattle have been grazing, and we look forward to working with these ranching families,” Fox said in a statement.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-09-06 13:57:28.740802

Transgender people incarcerated in Georgia prisons can once again receive some gender-affirming care, at least temporarily, following a judge’s order.
A federal judge ruled Thursday that a ban on using public funds for gender-affirming care in state prisons likely violates constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.
According to court documents, there are about 340 people in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, of whom 107 were receiving hormone replacement therapy as of the end of June. The system’s inmate population is more than 50,000.
Gov. Brian Kemp, who is a Republican, signed Senate Bill 185 into law in May, putting the ban into place. Attorneys for the state argued that Georgians’ tax dollars should not be spent on the controversial procedures.
“But ‘controversy’ does not take a medical question and turn it into a policy question,” U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Calvert wrote in her opinion pausing enforcement of the law while a legal challenge against it moves forward.
“An Eighth Amendment exception for political controversy could end up swallowing the rule that inmates are entitled to a baseline of medical care bearing some relationship to the standard of care provided to the public at large. If it were otherwise, prison officials could deny inmates the COVID-19 vaccine or treat a measles outbreak with chicken soup.”
Also on Thursday, the Georgia Board of Corrections voted to approve a rule change to comply with the law, specifying that no state funds may be used for surgical, hormone or cosmetic procedures to treat gender dysphoria. It allows for people already receiving treatment to have their dosage tapered to transition off the medication.
Calvert’s ruling directs the agency to stop tapering hormone medication and resume treatments for people who were previously receiving care and to consider new requests for gender-affirming treatments without taking the new state law  into account.
Emily Early, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which challenged the state law on behalf of five transgender people incarcerated in Georgia prisons, said the judge’s decision is in line with rulings from other states and established precedent.
“We’re not carving out any sort of new standard,” she said. “The Eighth Amendment standard is that you cannot take away care from an individual when that care has been deemed medically necessary without any sort of medical judgment. And that’s exactly what the state of Georgia has done here, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and the court at the district court level has agreed with our clients’ position.”
A Department of Corrections spokesperson declined to comment citing pending litigation.
The defendants, who include Georgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Tyrone Oliver, have filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
The bill’s author, Cataula Republican state Sen. Randy Robertson, expressed confidence that the law will eventually be upheld.
“I’m very comfortable with this,” he said in a phone call. “We knew that things like this were going to happen. Anytime you pass a controversial piece of legislation, you’re going to have individuals come out and challenge it, and that’s exactly what’s supposed to happen. Every piece of legislation that we pass out of the Capitol is subject to scrutiny by men and women who wear black robes, and that’s what we pay them for, and that’s their job. So this is just part of the process. I’m very confident that once everything is hashed out in the courtrooms, that the law will go into effect and will accomplish exactly what we need to accomplish for Georgia taxpayers.”
The bill was among the most controversial of the session as it worked its way through the Capitol this year. Four Senate Democrats broke ranks with their party to support it in that chamber, and four more did not vote. In the House, nearly the entire Democratic caucus walked out when it came up for a vote, a protest of a series of bills targeting the rights of transgender Georgians.
Transgender advocates worry that policies like Georgia’s are part of a cultural backlash against increased acceptance of transgender rights.

Now, a new firm is planning to pick up where Shell left off. (State of Alaska map)Last year, one of the world’s biggest oil companies walked away from a handful of promising leases in shallow waters just off the coast of Alaska’s North Slope.
The move by Shell, which some observers attributed to pressure from the company’s climate-conscious investors, raised questions about the future of oil development in the Arctic, particularly in more expensive and technically challenging areas offshore.
Companies can drill wells more cheaply, and with less environmental opposition, in parts of the Lower 48. If a deep-pocketed player like Shell wasn’t going to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to search for oil on remote North Slope oil prospects, who would?
The answer, it now appears, is a company that’s nothing like Shell: Narwhal Exploration, a small, Texas-based firm.
Narwhal, whose officials did not respond to requests for comment, has been quietly gearing up for what industry observers describe as one of the industry’s most intriguing drilling efforts in recent years.
This winter, the company plans to sink as many as five exploration wells into state land beneath West Harrison Bay — a shallow inlet of the Beaufort Sea.
The effort targets an oil-rich geologic formation, the Nanushuk, that had been mostly disregarded by the industry until a decade ago. That’s the same oil deposit being tapped by two huge onshore oil fields already under construction: ConocoPhillips’ Willow project and Santos’ Pikka project.
The closest community to Narwhal’s leases, the Iñupiaq village of Nuiqsut, is some 30 miles south.
Narwhal’s plans signal a notable step toward development in a remote area that geologists have long thought could hold huge reserves, but that has seen little exploration. It would be the first company ever to drill in West Harrison Bay.
A discovery there could be “sizable,” said Pete Stokes, an Anchorage-based, private sector petroleum engineer and consultant who spent years evaluating oil prospects on the North Slope — including, at one point, West Harrison Bay.
“I think there’s probably something there,” said Stokes. “The question would be how big a discovery it is and whether it can be economically developed.”
Narwhal’s search for oil could cost some $150 million, according to the website of a Florida-based private equity group that’s helping the company raise money.
West Harrison Bay has garnered interest from the oil industry for more than a decade. Shell acquired its leases there in 2012, while Narwhal — whose exploration manager and chief operating officer used to work for Shell — purchased neighboring leases in 2016.
“It’s an area that we’ve been real eager to see somebody do some exploration on,” said Derek Nottingham, director of the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas.
Despite reports of favorable geologic data, including promising results from decades-old wells drilled nearby, Shell never conducted any major exploration work in West Harrison Bay. The company cited an inability to find a suitable co-owner to share some of the costs.
Narwhal told state regulators in 2022 that it had made several offers to buy Shell’s leases, or to form a drilling partnership. But the energy giant never agreed.
Narwhal officials grew impatient: During a state legislative hearing last year they publicly criticized the commissioner of the state natural resources department for being “unwilling to hold Shell accountable” for not drilling on its leases or selling them.
A few weeks after the hearing, Shell announced that it was relinquishing its leases.
In a state auction last fall, a Narwhal affiliate called EE Partners and another privately owned company, Juneau Oil and Gas, collectively spent almost $9 million buying up the remaining tracts in West Harrison Bay — including Shell’s former holdings.

Juneau Oil and Gas, which outbid EE Partners on a number of parcels, has not informed the state oil and gas division of any plans to drill wells on its leases this winter, said Sean Clifton, an agency spokesperson.
The company, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, mainly focuses on prospects in the Gulf of Mexico, according to its website. But its manager, Brad Juneau, has ties to Alaska: He helped co-found Contango Ore, which holds several mining prospects in the state and owns a stake in the large-scale Manh Choh gold mine, near the Interior town of Tok.
Even if a company made a big discovery in West Harrison Bay, the infrastructure needed to start producing oil would take years to develop, given the logistical hurdles involved with getting it to market.
The leases in the bay are on submerged lands owned by the state of Alaska, whose more flexible permitting regime could allow development to move more quickly than in nearby federally managed areas like the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, according to industry observers. Development on state land also would give Alaska a greater share of royalty payments.
Drilling in West Harrison Bay would be closer to shore and shallower than at the far offshore prospect that Shell unsuccessfully drilled in the Chukchi Sea a decade ago. Other companies have successfully developed near-shore prospects on the North Slope.
Still, West Harrison Bay is “really remote,” said Nottingham. “There are some distinct logistical challenges in exploring, developing and producing that area.”
Building an oil field there could cost more than $8 billion, according to an estimate cited by Narwhal in a 2024 filing with state regulators. That’s roughly the amount ConocoPhillips is spending to develop Willow and more than double Santos’ construction costs at Pikka.
Narwhal has so far released few details about this winter’s drilling plans to regulators or the public. In various state and federal permit applications, it has outlined plans for summer field work, including sonar studies to help determine precise drilling locations.
The Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group, raised several concerns about the impacts of oil exploration in West Harrison Bay in a June letter responding to Narwhal’s application for a permit under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act.
The project “threatens the survival of threatened and endangered ice seals, bowhead whales, and other Arctic wildlife,” the group said in that 10-page letter.
The permit, which federal regulators ultimately granted, allows Narwhal to disturb 20 bowhead whales and more than 2,000 seals.

BEAR — Caravel quarterback Matthew Rice settled under center with just under 10 minutes to
play in the third quarter, positioned slightly across midfield. Rice took the third down snap,
rolled out to his right and zipped a pass to his senior receiver Tisyn Witcher along the right
sideline.
Witcher evaded a string of defenders in his path to score the Buccaneer’s first of five touchdowns
in the second half, defeating Red Lion Christian Academy, 42-18, Friday night.
The Buccaneer’s win was their first of the season and the first for the program as the newest
member of the 3A class.
Caravel was moved up to class 3A in December as part of a football realignment that moved
eight schools to new levels. Caravel won back to back 2A state championships the prior two
seasons and were runner up in 2022 before making the jump to 3A this season.
Caravel’s offense certainly looked the part of a 3A offense scoring touchdowns on all five of its
second half offensive possessions.
Witcher scored two of the five adding a pair of touchdown receptions to his rushing touchdown
that opened the scoring in the first quarter. Senior running back Joshua Roy carried Caravel’s
other three scores through the endzone accumulating over 200 yards on the ground for the
Buccaneer offense.
Red Lion strung together a trio of touchdown drives in the second half to try and chip away at
the Caravel lead, starting with a scoring drive that consisted of a single play.
Following a Caravel touchdown, Lion’s senior quarterback Evan Budinger lined up at his own 37
yard line in the shotgun formation with two receivers on his left and a running back behind him.
Budinger faked the hand off, took a small step back and lofted the ball to junior receiver Raheem
Spencer Jr. just as he crossed the Buccaneer’s 35 yard line. The ball fell majestically into his
hands and Spencer Jr. finished the play by sprinting through the left side of the endzone scoring
the Lion’s first touchdown.
Budinger scored the final two Red Lion touchdowns in the final six minutes of fourth quarter
with a pair of short runs near the goal line. Despite their tremendous effort, the Lions remain
winless through a difficult portion of their season facing two 3A teams in Salesianum and
Caravel right at the start.
Red Lion’s next game will be at home against Delaware County Christian School located in
Pennsylvania.
Caravel’s next game is a home matchup against undefeated St. Georges Technical High School.

Another said the decision should be left to local school districts, while a potential candidate is seeking local input on the issue.
Most school districts in South Dakota already have a policy in place that doesn’t allow cellphones in classrooms. About one-third of school districts take the further step of removing or locking away cellphones during class or school hours, based on a South Dakota Searchlight survey of superintendents and analysis of published school policies.
South Dakota’s lone U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Republican, announced three days after the publication of Searchlight’s story that, if elected governor next year, he would seek a statewide prohibition on student cellphone access during class time.
One-third of SD school districts remove or lock away student phones

“The state constitution makes it clear that kids should have quality education,” Johnson told Searchlight. “The state government setting a broad-stroke policy and then having the execution of that strategy and management done at the local level will give us the best of both worlds.”
South Dakota is one of 24 states to not implement a statewide policy or law to ban or limit cellphone use in classrooms. State lawmakers considered a statewide effort last legislative session, but held off after school administrators said they’d prefer to determine policies at the local level. The Legislature instead passed a resolution encouraging school boards to implement such policies.
According to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey, 72% of U.S. high school teachers say cellphone distraction is a major problem in the classroom. Some research suggests student performance improves after schools ban cellphones.
Other candidates weigh in
Two other announced candidates for governor said they support efforts to establish a statewide law or policy removing cellphones from classrooms.
South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, would support a statewide policy to ensure students focus “on learning, not on distractions” and foster healthier social interactions.

Democrat Robert Arnold, a 20-year-old college student who said he plans to run for governor, said a statewide policy or law would benefit students, but added that other efforts would be more impactful on student wellbeing, including providing universal free lunch and ensuring the federal Department of Education remains intact. Arnold said Johnson should support those efforts.
“Not a peep from him about policies that will have a real impact on our people, but he’ll of course propose legislation that at least makes it look like he cares about our children’s education,” Arnold said in an emailed statement.
Aberdeen businessman and Republican Toby Doeden said phones in classrooms are “roadblocks” to education and a “breeding ground” for negative influences and distractions. But he said school boards should address the issue.
“Allowing state leaders to mandate individual policy changes at the local level would set a terrible precedent and is an obvious constitutional overreach,” Doeden said in a text message. “As governor, I would absolutely lean on our local school boards to ban cellphones from the classrooms.”

Current Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden has not announced his intention to run, but is expected to enter the race. The Rhoden administration is asking school leaders if they prefer cellphone policies that come from the local or state level, spokesperson Josie Harms said in an emailed statement.
First Lady Sandy Rhoden spent the first few months of the Rhoden administration visiting schools to talk about the consequences of using cellphones during school hours.
Students at Platte-Geddes School District, the first in the state to lock away student cellphones during the school day three years ago, said the restriction improved relationships and academics, the first lady said in a statement. The students started to spend less time on their phones outside of school, too, leading to better self-discipline.
“Our students have so much to gain, and the constant distraction impedes their ability to learn,” she said.
School administrator representative encourages local control
Rob Monson, executive director of School Administrators of South Dakota, said school administrators prefer to handle the issue themselves. He surveyed members of his organization last year, when legislators considered introducing a bill.
“I think most school districts are doing what they feel they should and what’s best for their school districts and patrons,” Monson said.
Monson added that if a bill is introduced this legislative session, his organization will likely oppose it. 
Johnson hopes the Legislature passes a bill this winter setting a statewide standard, saying it’s a “no-brainer.”
“Once you identify an approach that clearly increases educational outcomes,” Johnson said, “that’s when it’s time to come together as a state and make sure every student is able to benefit from that policy.”

“We’re looking at a framework that responds to the budget realities while also keeping student needs at the forefront,” Yazmin Carretero, the board’s government relations and policy analyst, told members in their August meeting. 
The legislative platform communicates the board’s top priorities to the Legislature and will guide the legislative committee’s advocacy efforts during the 2026 legislative session. 
State lawmakers grappled this past session with a projected budget shortfall of more than $12 billion over four years.
They largely preserved funding for K-12 education in the 2025-27 budget, even increasing funding for special education programs and removing the artificial cap on state funding for students with disabilities. 
While that investment was a historic win for special education, there were reductions in other areas for elementary and secondary schools, and colleges. 
The 2025-27 budget reduced funding for college financial aid, and pared support for numerous grant-funded offerings such the Outdoor Learning Grants program.
Lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson will write a supplemental budget during the 60-day  session that starts in January.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal said Wednesday that his biggest supplemental budget request will be for $110 million per year to address inflation impacts on schools. 
“That’s a necessary thing,” Reykdal said, adding that he will wait to make his “big requests” in the 2027 long session when a new two-year budget is written. 
Last year, Reykdal sought $350.7 million in the two-year budget to cover inflationary costs of materials and supplies. The request was partially granted, with the budget including a $213,832 inflation adjustment.  
Meanwhile, the legislative platform of the Board of Education also avoids big asks and focuses instead on safeguarding what it considers essential elements for Washington public schools. 
The platform, which will be finalized in October, will stress the importance of maintaining civil rights protections, student supports and oversight and accountability systems. 
The board will advocate for the restoration of funding for alternative and nontraditional learning models, and for additional student supports like the High School and Beyond Plan. 
“We’re moving away from really just asking for a lot of new things and instead focusing on protecting the gains that we’ve made and the progress that we’ve made … and just restoring a few things that we’ve lost,” Carretero told the board in August.
She said the legislative team is “taking a thoughtful approach in investing in what works” to meet the most urgent needs. 
“These are decisions that are not to be made lightly or easily,” she said. 
There will be some minimal budget requests: a new contract for small agency IT services and a new administrator to handle an increasing volume of public records requests. 
“We are spending a lot of time and energy on this, and we don’t have dedicated staff,” Randy Spaulding, Board of Education executive director, told the board Thursday.

It’s the latest project from Renewablade, a company in Bondurant that has found a way to use the materials and, in turn, alleviate the issue of what to do with the massive hunks of fiberglass and resin. 
Brian Meng with Renewablade said the company is finally in production after several years of research and development to figure out the best way to grind up the blades and incorporate them into the concrete.

Right now, Renewablade makes three main products: the retaining wall blocks, like those used at the Premier Credit Union project, commercial highway barriers, and larger barriers used to bunker agricultural materials. 
“We’re not going to be building any superhighways with it — yet. We’re not going to be building skyscrapers with it. But certainly non-structural, free-cast concrete, I think it’s a great situation,” Meng said.
Premier Credit Union CEO Megan Tjernagel said the decision to use the recycled-blade blocks shows how the company cares for its environment. 
“By incorporating recycled wind turbine blades into this project, we’re showing that financial institutions can lead with purpose, embrace sustainable solutions, and make investments that benefit both our members and the communities we serve,” Tjernagel said in a press release. 
Building a blade recycling program
Meng has spent his career in the recycling industry and several years ago started to notice the need for recycling the blades, which by nature must be replaced about every 20 years. 
One study estimated by 2050 there would be more than 2 million tons of retired wind turbine blades in the U.S. 
Lawsuits cropped up in Iowa and other states as officials took notice of areas where the blades were being dumped and abandoned. It turned out the parties dumping the blades had been paid to recycle them but weren’t doing so.
“There’s a lot of people that have said they were going to be able to do that,” Meng said. “We’re one of the rare companies that actually recycles them into a product.” 
Another Iowa-based company, REGEN Fiber, processes the blades into a grind that can be added to various types of concrete. A company in Boone has focused on the turbine generators and recycles rare earth materials from decommissioned wind turbines. 
Meng said Renewablade collects the blades from Iowa turbines, which are easier to transport to the company’s processing facility in Earlham, and from as far as Seattle and Maine. 
Meng said it “works well” when the decommissioned blades are close to home. For example, Renewablade recycled some of the blades that were damaged in a tornado near Greenfield in 2024. The blades can be around 200 feet long, or about the wingspan of a Boeing 747 jet, which makes transportation difficult and expensive. 
The scale also means these blades take up a lot of space in a landfill. And yet, once ground up into concrete blocks, Renewablade was able to repurpose the blades from one whole turbine in just one small parking lot wall. 
“The size reduction is a big part of it,” Meng said. 
Despite early pushback in Earlham towards the business, Meng said the company is fully operational this year with big plans to expand. Meng said the company is eying expansions into the UK and Texas. 
“Now it really is just a matter of being able to have more customers come in and want to take the products,” Meng said.

(Sirisak Boakaew/Getty Images)Ada County’s commissioners will soon decide zoning code changes that will impact the price we pay for electricity and the quality of the air we breathe. 
Because some have argued that large solar projects endanger farmland in Ada County, the commission is considering a recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission to effectively ban large-scale solar development on most land in Ada County, even if it has never been in agricultural production. That is an extreme approach that will saddle Idaho Power ratepayers with higher energy prices while increasing our reliance on more polluting energy resources.
Idaho Power’s 20-year energy plan predicts large increase in customer growth and peak energy load

We face explosive growth in electricity demand and prices. Idaho Power has already proposed a $199 million dollar rate increase to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission that will significantly increase our monthly electricity bills. To supply the future electricity we need at a price that we can afford, Idaho Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan contends that we should build 1,445 MW of new solar capacity between 2026 and 2033 … along with 700 MW of wind and 450 MW of gas generation. Their analysis argues that solar is the cheapest new energy capacity and our best energy choice. 
Unfortunately, the recommended ordinance by the Planning and Zoning Commission would subject proposed solar projects to vague, undefined standards while sharply limiting the land available to them. Doing so would effectively ban large scale solar in Ada County and hamstring Idaho Power’s efforts to supply additional electricity at reasonable cost. 
Moreover, telling landowners that they cannot lease their land to a solar developer for a 30-year period is also an assault on private property rights and a case of clear government overreach. 
The threat to farmland is not solar; the threat to farmland is rising farm production costs, uncertain commodity prices, markets roiled by trade disputes, labor shortages, and the ever-present pressure to subdivide and develop. 
Solar can help keep land in the hands of farm families since the land can be leased for energy production rather than sold for strip malls and housing developments. Solar installations can even be compatible with agricultural uses as seen in a new trend called Agrivoltaics, the practice of combining solar panel installations with agricultural land use. 
For example, some farmers in the Midwest are raising livestock or cool weather crops in pastures with solar panels to provide shade and preserve soil moisture— a new concept with the potential to achieve synergies between food and energy production. It may be that combining solar with agriculture will enhance agricultural yields, reduce water consumption, increase land use efficiency, and raise farm incomes. 
This proposed ordinance will drive Idaho energy prices even higher than they are already poised to go, and it will take what is arguably our cleanest and cheapest energy option off the table in Ada County. It would be a grave mistake for the commissioners to adopt it.

In the hearing, Kennedy openly criticized CDC professionals’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying “the people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving.”
Kennedy’s hearing came on the heels of a contentious week in which Kennedy fired the CDC’s director, Susan Monarez, spurring 12 members of the Senate Finance Committee — including 11 Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders — to call on Kennedy to resign from his position.
At least four top CDC leaders resigned following Monarez’s ouster, citing pressure from Kennedy to depart from recommendations based on sound scientific evidence.
I am a teaching professor and public health professional. Like many of my colleagues, the disruption happening at the CDC in recent months has left me scrambling to find alternate credible sources of health information and feeling deeply concerned for the future of public health.
 
The CDC’s unraveling
These leadership shakeups come on the heels of months of targeted actions aimed at unraveling the CDC’s structure, function and leadership as it has existed for decades.
The turmoil began almost as soon as President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, when his administration enacted sweeping cuts to the CDC’s workforce that health experts broadly agree jeopardized its ability to respond to emerging health threats.
Trump used executive orders to limit CDC employees’ communication with the public and other external agencies, like the World Health Organization.
Within weeks, he ordered as much as 10% of the overall workforce to be cut.
Soon after, Kennedy — who was newly appointed by Trump — began undoing long-standing CDC institutions, like the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, replacing all 17 of its members in a move that was widely denounced by health experts.
Critics pointed to a lack of qualifications for the new committee members, with more than half never having published research on vaccinations and many having predetermined hostility toward vaccines.
In June, more than 20 authoritative organizations, including the National Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, expressed serious concerns for the health impacts of overhauling the advisory committee.
 
How Monarez’s removal spurred the crisis

	Public health leaders had cheered the July confirmation of Monarez as the CDC’s new director, seeing her nomination as a welcome relief to those who value evidence-based practice in public health. Monarez is an accomplished scientist and career public servant.
Many viewed her as a potential voice of scientific wisdom amid untrained officials appointed by Trump, who has a track record of policies that undermine public health and science.
In her role as acting director, to which she was appointed in January, Monarez had quietly presided over the wave of cuts to the CDC workforce and other moves that drastically reshaped the agency and weakened the country’s capacity to steward the nation’s health.
Yet Monarez had “red lines” that she would not cross: She would not fire CDC leadership, and she would not endorse vaccine policies that ran contrary to scientifically supported recommendations.
According to Monarez, Kennedy asked her to do both in an Aug. 27 meeting. When she refused, he asked her to resign.
Her lawyers pushed back, arguing that only the president had the authority to remove her, stating: “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.”
Ultimately, the White House made her dismissal official later that evening.
 
An agency in turmoil

	Further exemplifying and deepening the crisis at the agency, on Aug. 8, a gunman who had expressed anger over COVID-19 vaccinations opened fire on CDC headquarters, killing a police officer.
Many health workers attributed this directly to misinformation spread by Kennedy. The shooting amplified tensions and made tangible the sense of threat under which the CDC has been operating over the tumultuous months since Trump’s second term began. One employee stated that “the CDC is crumbling.”
Public health experts, including former CDC directors, are sounding the alarm, speaking out about the precariousness of the agency’s position. Some are questioning whether the CDC can even survive.
 
A crisis of trust

	Even before the most recent shock waves, Americans said they were losing trust and confidence in CDC guidance: In April, 44% of U.S. adults polled said that they will place less trust in CDC recommendations under the new leadership. This would undoubtedly undermine the U.S. response if the country faces another public health challenge requiring a rapid, coordinated response, like COVID-19.
In addition to installing new members on the vaccine advisory committee, Kennedy abruptly changed the recommendations for flu and COVID-19 vaccines without input from the CDC or the vaccine advisory committee, and contrary to data presented by CDC scientists.
Public health professionals and advocates are now warning the public that vaccine recommendations coming from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices may not be trustworthy. They point to the lack of credibility in the review process for the new committee, the fact that members have made statements contrary to scientific evidence in the past, and failure to apply an evidence-to-recommendations framework as compromising factors. Critics of the committee even describe a lack of basic understanding of the science behind vaccines.
Health impacts are being felt in real time, with health care providers reporting confusion among parents as a result of the conflicting vaccine recommendations. Now, those who want to be vaccinated are facing barriers to access, with major retailers placing new limits on vaccine access in the face of federal pressure. This as vaccination rates were already declining, largely due to misinformation.
The end result is an environment in which the credibility of the CDC is in question because people are unsure whether recommendations made in the CDC’s name are coming from the science and scientists or from the politicians who are in charge.
 
Filling the gaps

	Reputable organizations are working to fill the void created by the CDC’s precariousness and the fact that recommendations are now being made based on political will, rather than scientific evidence.
The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Gynecology have both released recommended vaccination schedules that, for the first time, diverge from CDC recommendations.
And medical organizations are discussing strategies that include giving more weight to their recommendations than the CDC’s and creating pathways for clinicians to obtain vaccines directly from manufacturers. These measures would create workarounds to compensate for CDC leadership voids.
Some states, including California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico, are establishing their own guidance regarding vaccinations. Public health scientists and physicians are attempting to preserve data and surveillance systems that the Trump administration has been removing. But independent organizations may not be able to sustain this work without federal funding.
 
What’s at stake

	As part of its crucial work in every facet of public health, the CDC oversees larger-scale operations, both nationally and globally, that cannot simply be handed off to states or individual organizations. Some public health responses — such as to infectious diseases and foodborne illnesses — must be coordinated at the national level in order to be effective, since health risks are shared across state borders.
In a health information space that is awash with misinformation, having accurate, reliable health statistics and evidence-based guidelines is essential for public health educators like me to know what information to share and how to design effective health programs. Doctors and other clinicians rely on disease tracking to know how best to approach treating patients presenting with infections. The COVID-19 pandemic made clear the importance of laboratory science, a unified emergency response and rapid distribution of effective vaccines to the public.
One of the strengths of the American system of governance is its ability to approach challenges — including public health — in a coordinated way, having a federal level of cooperation that unifies state-level efforts.
The CDC has been the nation’s preeminent public health institution for more than eight decades as a result of its vast reach and unparalleled expertise. Right now, it’s all sitting at a precarious edge.

One has to wonder what drives people like Ron DeSantis and so-called conservatives who take every opportunity to disparage Florida’s diverse and vibrant LGBTQ community.
Why are they so insecure? What are they so afraid of?
Since he came into office, the governor has shown disdain to this maligned community, used disparaging language and, most of all, misused his political muscle in attempts to scare and bully.
Everything DeSantis does is contaminated by ideology. His actions are aimed at rendering invisible gays, queer, and trans people, plus Black and Brown people and other marginalized groups. That’s never gonna happen, but that’s not stopping him and his allies from doing everything they can to make people’s lives miserable.
Last month, DeSantis and various parts of his state apparatus, in concert with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, continued their harassment when the Florida Department of Transportation sent letters to at least 14 Florida cities, demanding that they remove rainbow and other painted crosswalks or lose millions in state and federal funding.
The issue has been simmering since a July 1 directive from Duffy, who gave U.S. governors 60 days to identify “safety improvements.”
“Roads are for safety, not political messages or artwork,” Duffy said in a statement at the time. He later elaborated: “Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks. Political banners have no place on public roads. I’m reminding recipients of @USDOT roadway funding that it’s limited to features advancing safety, and nothing else. It’s that simple.”
A spokesperson for the Florida DOT told NBC News via email that the department has a duty to “ensure the safety and consistency of public roadways and transportation systems” and therefore ensure “roadways are not utilized for social, political, or ideological interests.”
‘Political purposes’
DeSantis echoed Duffy.
“We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes,” he said on X.
One of the most egregious consequences to come out of DeSantis’ action was the recent dead-of-night painting over of the rainbow sidewalk by Florida transportation workers at a memorial set up at what used to be the Pulse nightclub. The memorial honors the 49 people fatally shot there in 2016 in what was the largest mass shooting in the country at the time.
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer castigated the action on social media.
“We are devastated to learn that overnight the state painted over the Pulse Memorial crosswalk on Orange Avenue,” Dyer wrote. “This crosswalk not only enhanced safety and visibility for the large number of pedestrians visiting the memorial, it also served as a visual reminder of Orlando’s commitment to honor the 49 lives taken.”
Dyer asserted that the crosswalk, installed by the state in 2017, adheres to safety standards. Brandon Wolf, one of the Pulse shooting’s survivors, described the removal as a desecration of the deceased victims’ memories.
“In the dark of night, they came to erase our show of solidarity, our declaration that we will never forget,” he wrote on X. “The cowards who feel threatened by our lives should feel lucky they didn’t have to bury the ones they love — then watch the state come & desecrate their memory.”
One weird justification transportation officials offered is that the rainbow artwork on Ocean Drive and 12th Street in Miami Beach poses a risk for drivers and pedestrians.
Statistics reflect otherwise.
According to crash data, the intersection at 12th and Ocean has had just 15 accidents since the artwork was installed in 2018 — fewer than neighboring intersections at 10th Street (37 crashes) and 13th Street (23 crashes).
Erasure
The Rev. Susan Gage, an Episcopal priest who ministers to a number of LGPTQ people and members, told me she is troubled but unsurprised by the DeSantis administration’s attempts as erasure.
“I found out about it probably the same way everybody else did. People in Orlando woke up and found out the crosswalk at Pulse was removed overnight,” she said. “Here in Tallahassee, some kids painted crosswalks that were colorful with stars, music, stuff that made it look pretty. Some of that was all done with private money including the Knight Foundation as a part of a private-public partnership with the city.”
That’s gone now, too.
Gage, like other critics, sees what DeSantis is doing as narrow-mindedness bathed in petty grievance and the desire to punish.
“I wonder, is this really the best use of public money?” she asked. “Like the tearing up of Black Lives Matter Plaza in D.C., this shows that they are going to try to erase: Blacks, queers, everything that isn’t the standard of the white male. It was all cool until Ron DeSantis said it wasn’t.”
The Rev. Terrence Taylor, who has led the Church of the Transfiguration in Miami Gardens for 15 years, said he’s at a loss to explain the DeSantis foolishness.
“It’s upsetting,” he said. “Why, with all the priorities you say you have, are you’re doing this? He’s playing to the base and there’s an appetite for it, playing to people’s fears, resurrecting things I thought was settled. Why are we on this now? What is your point other than to harass people? Why would you do this.? It has to feed a base or something. It doesn’t feed me but it feeds someone.”
‘Deeply offensive’
Those most affected aren’t taking this lying down. There have been protests across South Florida and in Orlando, where demonstrators replaced the rainbow colors in chalk while DeSantis sent minions to repaint the space and posted state troopers. Taxpayers’ money at work!
The anger is widespread and palpable.
State Sen. Shevrin Jones wrote an op-ed describing DeSantis’s actions at the Pulse nightclub as “a deeply offensive decision.”
“DeSantis’ erasure of the memorial is not merely a disregard for a physical space, but a profound desecration of sacred ground and a grievous affront to the memory of the 49 lives lost and the countless others impacted by the horrific mass shooting targeting the LGBTQ community,” he wrote.
“Erasing the rainbow crosswalk was not a neutral act of urban planning, but a calculated move that disregards the sanctity of a site forever marked by unimaginable pain and loss.”
Jones argues this serves “as chilling reminders of the ongoing struggle against those who seek to deny history and diminish the suffering of marginalized communities. It signals a deeply troubling lack of respect for the victims and survivors, as well as for the broader LGBTQ community and its allies who have found solace and strength in this sacred space.”
Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis concurred.
“It’s an attempt to try to erase the presence of anything to do with the LGBTQ community,” Trantalis said. “… It could be the gay community this year — who knows what’s going to be next year. We don’t know where they are going to keep trying to eliminate the diversity of what represents Florida.”
Gage, Trantalis, and Taylor said state politicians should be concentrating on Florida’s many more pressing priorities.
“Honestly, I wish the state would focus more on affordable insurance, homelessness, and finding affordable housing,” said Trantalis.
Orange County Democratic state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith complained the city of Orlando never had an opportunity to appeal.
“The DeSantis administration is resorting to deliberate lies to justify their indefensible, state-sponsored vandalism at the Pulse nightclub site, done without notice or consent from the City of Orlando,” Smith said. “This crosswalk was not only a tribute to those murdered in 2016, it was also an FDOT-approved installation designed to enhance pedestrian safety for the countless people who come here to pay their respects year after year.”
DeSantis didn’t enforce a rule or new law, Smith asserted.
“He invented an excuse to punish LGBTQ visibility and draw attention to himself. Nothing in Florida law requires the state to act with such callousness and cruelty. Even the first FDOT’s memo stated that they used their discretion to grant exceptions. The state cannot revoke the legal rights of municipalities to administrative appeal and review. That’s why cities and residents are fighting back,” he added.
Smith said cities “are exploring legal options against the State, and Floridians are responding back with new murals and art installations that are bigger, queerer, and more colorful than Ron ever imagined. They are sending a clear message: we will not be erased, and love always wins.

Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore Police Commissioner Rich Worley, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland L. Butler Jr. and Maryland Transportation Authority Police Chief Joseph Scott. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) is ordering a surge in law enforcement presence in Baltimore, following weeks of sparring with President Donald Trump (R) and his threat to deploy troops to deal with crime in the city.
Neither Moore nor Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) mentioned Trump by name Friday as they announced plans for a “renewed collaboration” between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police. But many of their remarks responded to charges by Trump, who recently called Baltimore a crime “hellhole.”
Moore said violent crime has been dropping over the last few years in Baltimore, and that the increased police resources will continue efforts to bring down violent crime even further.
“We are proud of the progress that we’ve been able to make, and we’re all very, very concerned about how much work still needs to happen,” Moore said. “If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that is one too many.”
The announcement came at a news conference outside St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, after a brief walk through the Park Heights neighborhood by officials. Despite his high-profile public feud with the president, Moore insisted that Friday’s announcement was not “inspired” by recent comments by Trump.
“Nothing we do is inspired by the president,” he said, in response to a reporters’ questions.
While it may not have been inspired by Trump, Friday’s announcement included repeated references to the president’s continued threats to deploy the National Guard to Baltimore and other large cities, as he has done in Washington, D.C. over the last month.
Moore welcomes help from FBI, other agencies, but says National Guard should stay home

Moore has repeatedly pushed back on the use of National Guard troops for crime prevention, arguing that Guard members are not trained for policing and that such a deployment would be disrespectful to them and of little benefit to residents.
“We do not need an occupation. We do not need people putting in performative and theatrical resources because they do not care about the actual results,” Moore said.
Trump, who deployed Guard members and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in June to quell immigration protests, followed up last month by sending the National Guard into Washington, D.C. The D.C. Guard members, along with Guard units from six Republican states, have been backing up local police, but have also been involved in removing homeless encampments and aiding with immigration arrests.
In recent weeks, Trump has dangled the possibility of entering other cities, like Baltimore and Chicago, that he said were “so far gone” in terms of  violent crime. The list has continued to grow, with New Orleans and Portland, Oregon, the most recent potential targets.
Moore shot back on Aug. 21 at the president’s suggestion that troops should be deployed to Baltimore, telling Trump to “keep our names out of your mouth.” Moore also invited the president Trump to come walk the streets of Baltimore to get a firsthand look at the city’s crime prevention efforts.
The back-and-forth has continued since, with Trump again disparaging Baltimore earlier this week, saying that Moore needs to “get rid of the criminals” in the city.
“These are hard-core criminals,” Trump said at a Tuesday press conference. “They’re not going to be good in 10 years, in five years, in 20 years, in two years they’re going to be criminals. They were born to be criminals.”
Scott also did not name the president in his Friday comments but clearly referenced those comments and pushed back against Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard in Baltimore.
“We do not need troops on our streets,” Scott said. “We do need folks who want to be at the table to recognize that the people of Baltimore are humans — that our young people are not born to be criminals. They’re resources to invest in, not problems to be solved.”
Scott has a personal connection to the area where the press conference took place: He grew up in the Park Heights neighborhood, and said that he witnessed a shooting in the area growing up.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“None of us are celebrating, saying that we have solved gun violence,” Scott said, adding that the use of the Maryland State Police will help provide more government resources and allow the use of evidence-based policies targeted to a continued reduction in crime.
Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland L. Butler Jr. said with the renewed partnership, “there will be no daylight” between the state police department and the city police.
“We intend to go out and provide the services that you need to feel safe,” Butler said, “and enhance the safety you already feel.”
Baltimore City Police Commissioner Rich Worley agreed.
“Adding additional resources to our neighborhoods is one important step towards creating safer communities and improving the quality of life in our city,” he said. “We have work to do, especially in communities like park heights.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_sept5_moorescottcops-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-06 01:56:32.993791

Dozier-Williams, who says that's where Maryland needs to lead.","A former federal worker who has lost his job at the Department of Education walks out of the building with boxes of belongings in Washington, D.C. on March 28, 2025. (Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)I’m a Marylander, a former federal employee and a father raising my family here. Watching federal troops roll into Washington, D.C., on the theory that force can stand in for safety, I keep returning to a simpler truth Maryland has proven: Durable public safety rests on economic security. Caring about well-being starts with protecting work, wages and the least-advantaged Marylanders when Washington pulls back on jobs.
In June, Maryland lost an estimated 3,500 federal jobs — the largest one-month drop in nearly 30 years. Since January, the state has shed 12,700 federal positions — the most of any state. This is not to imply that laid-off public servants will commit offenses; it does mean income shocks ripple through rents, small-business cash flow, and youth opportunity — the very neighborhood conditions that drive welfare concerns.
The consequences of Washington’s job policy are arriving here first and hardest.
The exposure to such losses is structural, as roughly 229,000 Marylanders draw a federal paycheck, and federal activity pours well over $100 billion into our economy each year. When that machine slows or shifts, Main Streets from Suitland to Bethesda feel it acutely.
To his credit, Gov. Wes Moore moved to create a one-stop portal, fast-tracking state hiring and launching fairs and pipelines so displaced federal workers can land on their feet quickly. That instinct was right, though a temporary hiring freeze later paused the effort. With jobs already slipping and more losses possible, Annapolis should build a permanent jobs shock-absorber for Maryland’s labor market. An automatic stabilizer that snaps on whether the trigger is federal layoffs, AI-driven displacement, or the next sectoral shake-out.

Picture the Friday when a paycheck stops: the car note comes due, a shift gets cut at the corner shop, a teenager skips summer work to watch siblings. None of that makes headlines, but it’s where safety is won or lost.
A jobs stabilizer isn’t a campaign slogan; it’s a short bridge between one employer and the next, so families don’t fall and main streets don’t hollow. In Maryland, we know how to build bridges. Let’s build this one — quietly, quickly and on purpose so a job loss becomes a landing, not a spiral.
Consider three ways Maryland can meet this moment for displaced federal workers and the communities that depend on their paychecks:
Guarantee 60- to 90-day reemployment for displaced feds and contractors. Stand up a permanent “Feds to Maryland” program that (a) preclears skills into state and local classifications, (b) funds short, paid “bridge” upskilling sprints, and (c) offers time-limited wage insurance when workers take a lower-paid role to stay employed. This complements the administration’s earlier state-hiring push by turning a one-off response into lasting, economic development infrastructure.
Make our workforce innovation-ready. Use Maryland’s AI Subcabinet to identify occupations most exposed to automation (admin, compliance, customer support) and bolt them into registered apprenticeships and short-cycle credentials under the RAISE framework. Implement a public AI risk map by county and agency to ensure training dollars align with actual exposure. The goal isn’t to fear AI or technological innovation; it’s to ensure workers can move up the value chain and leverage it to their advantage before disruption lands.
Stabilize neighborhoods when incomes dip. Establish a Prompt Pay Guarantee and a Family Bridge. Pay small and minority-owned contractors on time, every time; help families cover a month or two of basics during a layoff; and work with community banks to keep borrowing costs down by placing a slice of state cash with community banks in the hardest-hit corridors so they can lend more cheaply. That’s economic justice in practice.
Again, federal layoffs are not a direct, one-way road to violent crimes. I’m arguing that income shocks, not ideology, turn ordinary stresses into hard choices. The evidence is clearest for property crime when unemployment rises; violence is more complex.
Baltimore’s progress shows that prevention plus opportunity tracks with safety. Which is why, if Washington retrenches while projecting force, Maryland should double down on the basics: Keep paychecks coming and cash moving so strain doesn’t become desperation.
We can’t steer Washington, but we can steady Maryland. In a state that has chosen “work, wages, and wealth” as its north star, the task now is simple and serious: Create a safety net that employs workers and deploys funds to families so shocks become transitions, not crises. Measure success by this: the least-advantaged households stay housed, small firms keep hours posted, and workers step into the next job before the last one is gone.

CVS confirmed the Nevada Board of Pharmacy issued new guidance Friday and as a result the vaccines will be made available, though they offered no timeline on when people can expect to receive them.
“Following today’s regulatory action by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday.
CVS previously announced it would not offer the updated COVID vaccine in Nevada and two other states because they only allow pharmacists to administer drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. That panel has not approved this season’s COVID vaccine and now includes vaccine skeptics appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
According to The Nevada Independent, which first reported the new guidance, the Board of Pharmacy’s position is that pharmacists are allowed to widely administer vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Nevada has a COVID vaccine access problem; legislative leader calls for state action

The Board of Pharmacy did not immediately respond to the Current Friday afternoon. The board’s website, which typically lists regulations and announcements, is currently offline because it was impacted by the recent ransomware attack on the state’s information technology.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who on Thursday called the state to take action as soon as possible to address vaccine access, said the legislative leader plans to review the new guidance “to determine whether this is a sufficient long-term fix or whether it’s just a temporary solution and further action may be needed.”

Like officials at a number of charities around the state, Helfrich said a pause in the CFC won’t be catastrophic for her organization. But it’s not good news either, and she said it could be particularly hard on smaller charities.
“We’re grateful for every dollar that we get, but there’s other organizations that work with all volunteers,” said Helfrich, St. Vincent de Paul’s chief advancement officer. “If they’re working with very limited resources, it [the CFC pause] will affect them … It hurts all organizations, but it’s particularly going to hurt small organizations that depend on those dollars to operate completely.”
The Combined Federal Campaign facilitates donations by federal workers around the nation to thousands of charities, through regular payroll deductions or volunteer hours. Workers choose the charity they want their money to support: In Maryland, hundreds of charities receive funding from the CFC, supporting causes that include education, health, museums, the environment and more.
The CFC solicitation period, when employees can make pledges and donations to charities, typically begins in early September. But this year, the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to pause all support to the CFC while it decides whether or not to continue the 64-year-old program.
No reason was given for the pause, and OPM said in a statement that “no final decision has been made on the program.”

The CFC has raised more than $9 billion since it was established in 1961, and more than $70 million in 2023 alone, according to the program’s website.
St. Vincent de Paul, which supports people facing poverty in Baltimore and surrounding counties, gets about $20,000 a year toward its $32 million budget, so the pause is not fatal, Helfrich said. But it does make for an “uncertain future” for some of their programs, and comes at a time when federal funding cuts, firings and forced retirements will affect the number of donors, she said.
Laura Osuri, the executive director of Homes Not Borders, described the CFC pause as a “death by 1,000 cuts,” as it comes on top of recent federal funding and grant cuts.
Homes Not Borders helps refugees and forced migrants in the Washington, D.C., area navigate life in the U.S. by assisting them with home set-ups, income opportunities and career training. The organization operates on about $800,000 per year, with about $15,000 of that coming from the CFC, Osuri said.
“I don’t think we’re going to be cutting programs or staff because of it [the CFC pause], but it’s just another burden to try and raise more funds for us,” she said. “Even though it [the CFC check] is not much, it is steady, and we know it’s coming.”
That was echoed by Elise Krikau, chief philanthropy officer at the Maryland Food Bank, who said it has seen struggles with its “diversity of funding.”
The organization recently faced cuts to its funding from two government programs: The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Local Food Purchase Agreement. Krikau said the food bank typically gets about $225,000 per year from the CFC, which she called a small part of its budget, but a large amount of money when thinking about overall funding cuts.
“This is one piece — but it’s a piece in a big puzzle,” Krikau said. “If everything gets stilted and there’s impacts from every direction, that can cumulatively impact our bottom line.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Arc Maryland, which supports people with developmental disabilities, gets a couple thousand dollars a year from the CFC, said Ande Kolp, the organization’s executive director. It’s not a large sum of money compared to the overall budget, but it is yet another source of funding that has “dried up,” she said.
Historically, The Arc Maryland has been able to rely on grants, she said, but it has recently faced struggles.
“There might have been 100 people going after the same grant before — now there’s 1,000 people going after the same grant,” Kolp said. “I think the competition has certainly grown and made it very difficult to access sources of funding we didn’t have difficulty accessing in the past.”
The organization will have to cut back on specific assistance programs, like transportation assistance and informative classes for parents on  IEPs — individualized educational plans for students — if they continue to lose funding, she said.
“There’s so much uncertainty out there, and it’s really impacting our ability to function as a business,” Kolp said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4821013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

Sept. 5, 2025 | ScreenshotU.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin on Friday laid out a national security and foreign policy vision rooted in the economic concerns of middle-class Americans, as the Democrat from Holly called for sweeping reforms to address emerging global threats and technological competition with China.
In remarks made at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City, Slotkin said her approach was forged out of the input she gathered during town halls held in Troy and Benton Harbor, where constituents linked national security to day-to-day economic stress. 
“A national security strategy worth its salt must do two things,” Slotkin said. “First, protect U.S. citizens, the homeland, and our way of life. And second, advance American prosperity. That’s it.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Slotkin said many Americans have lost confidence that the United States has a coherent foreign policy that truly advanced the nation’s priorities. 
“And they have good reason to feel uneasy,” she said. “Informed by them, I’m going to focus on the three big things that, if we get right, will define American security for the next 50 years.”
Slotkin said those three priorities included treating economic security as national security, which required leaders to be “ruthless about growing the middle class.” Secondly, she said the U.S. had to treat the tech race like it did the nuclear and space races and ensure the nation dominates in that sector. Finally, Slotkin said the government needs to rethink how it protects Americans in a rapidly changing threat landscape.

Slotkin proposed a series of policy initiatives she said were aimed at reshaping how the U.S. approaches global competition. 
Among them: creating a Cyber National Guard that would be focused on defending against digital threats, a Manhattan Project-style effort to win the AI race against China, and a Sovereign Wealth Fund that would invest in high-risk, high-reward technologies.
Slotkin warned that China has weaponized global supply chains and called for stronger domestic production of critical items.
“While some items, like Rubik’s Cubes and ladies’ razors, will never again be made in the U.S., critical items like pharmaceuticals, chips, and autos should be made, at least in part, in the U.S.,” she said. “China has weaponized these supply chains, giving them a veto on our economy that we should not accept.”
Slotkin, a former CIA analyst and Pentagon official, painted a stark picture of technological rivalry with Beijing.
“We are in a tech race with China right now,” she said. “And there’s no area more important to win than on artificial intelligence. The last time we were in a race like this, we won by setting up the Manhattan Project … We need the same level of ambition now, updated for the modern age.”
Amidst that national security focus, she also urged policies that would also improve middle-class livelihoods.
“Smart industrial policy also means prosperity for the middle class,” Slotkin said. “New manufacturing, engineering, and construction jobs. And critically, it means spreading the wealth across America, not just enriching 18 tech executives in Silicon Valley.”
Slotkin’s remarks came amid a broader debate in Washington over how to confront China’s global influence, secure domestic supply chains, and ensure U.S. leadership in critical technologies.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-124328-1024x586.png,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

Senate Joint Resolution 8201, if passed in November, would amend the state constitution to allow assets of the program, known as the WA Cares Fund, to be handled similarly to pension and retirement accounts. 
That would lead to larger returns in the long run, ensuring premiums stay low and the program is sustainable, advocates said in a call with reporters Friday.
“I think this is just a no-brainer,” said Greg Markley, secretary treasurer of the Washington State Association of Firefighters. He’s also chair of the Washington State Investment Board, whose fiduciary responsibility is to manage retirement and public fund investments. He was not representing the board Friday.
A state lawmaker opposing the ballot measure says it amounts to “gambling in the stock market” with taxpayers’ dollars.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies and private equity firms. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds and certificates of deposit that are less risky but with lower rates of returns. 
Pension and retirement accounts are exempt from that prohibition. The resolution, if approved by voters, would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of exempt funds.
Voters defeated a similar measure in 2020 by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. 
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the program’s benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation.
Collections by the state began in July 2023. A person pays as long as they are working in the state. Deductions stop if they retire, become unemployed or leave the workforce, and resume if the person returns to work. As of March, $2 billion in tax collections had been banked in the program’s trust fund.
Backers say the public better understands the long-term care program than it did five years ago.
And they hope in the coming weeks to make them aware that the Washington State Investment Board has been earning 7% or more on pension funds, a  couple percentage points higher than its investments in government bonds. That difference will translate to a lot more dollars in the trust account for the program, they said.
Four state lawmakers — a Democrat and three Republicans — are leading the opposition. They’ve signed the opposition statement in the voter’s pamphlet that will be sent out statewide in October. It is online now.
They argue it would be “financial roulette” to put the money in “an unstable market.” Right now, “it’s safeguarded in secured investments like federal, state and municipal bonds which support our communities.”
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, fought the measure five years ago. He’s doing it again now.
“It’s gambling in the stock market. It’s a breach of fiduciary responsibility when you put taxpayer dollars at risk,” he said Friday. 
Hasegawa said investing in municipal bonds may earn a little less but it provides a broad public benefit by helping local governments carry out projects. “I have faith in the voters that they will make the right decision,” he said.
Gary Bruebaker, who served as the state’s chief investment officer for 19 years, said this debate “has gone on for decades, and will continue to go on. There are some people that are extremely conservative and they don’t want to take any risk at all.”
By not investing in equities, he said, you’re accepting a lower return than what that the taxpayers and the stakeholders in Washington deserve. While there is risk on a year to year basis, there’s less risk over a longer term with the state’s diversified portfolio, he said.
Approve 8201, the political committee campaigning for passage, had reported raising $220,476 as of Friday. All of it is from the Service Employees International Union 775 which represents 55,000 long-term care workers in Washington, Montana and Alaska.
There was no campaign committee raising money to oppose the measure as of Friday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LONDON — The city council in this small Eastern Kentucky town ousted embattled Mayor Randall Weddle after an hours-long hearing at the local courthouse Friday. 
Heading into the hearing, Weddle faced nearly a dozen charges of misconduct and willful neglect of duty, but the six London City Council members ultimately agreed to remove him from office on only three of the charges. 
The council approved charges that alleged Weddle refused to publish an enacted ordinance and then delayed its timely publication, did not fill vacancies on the city’s ethics commission in a timely manner and signed a $5 million mortgage without council approval. 
Nevertheless, Weddle told reporters after the meeting he plans to appeal the removal in circuit court. He also pointed to the hundreds of citizens in the city and county who signed petitions in favor of keeping him in office as a sign that residents were against the council’s decision. London, a town of about 7,500 people, is the Laurel County seat. 
“They don’t care. They have an agenda,” Weddle said of the city council.

Weddle had previously contended that the votes were stacked against him, as the council appointed a new member to fill a vacancy earlier this week.  
After voting, the city council appointed a new London mayor — Tracie Handley. According to her social media accounts online, she is a local artist. 
Friday’s removal of Weddle is the latest in a months-long brawl between London City Council members and Weddle. City Council meetings became public spectacles as the former mayor and the council members argued back and forth about the allegations. Plus, citizens packed meeting rooms to show their support for or opposition to the mayor. 
The clashes have also spilled over onto social media. Facebook livestreams for recent city council meetings have gained hundreds of comments. Weddle has also posted Facebook statuses about city meetings, such as uploading a circus flyer for one meeting, complete with city council members’ faces superimposed on clowns. 
After a council meeting earlier this week, Weddle vowed to run for reelection in 2026 and: “We’re going to give ’em hell.”

The courthouse hearing was no quiet affair. Most of the audience members inside the room were supporters of Weddle who clapped for him whenever he entered the room and donned t-shirts that said, “I stand with Mayor Weddle.”
The audience was mostly quiet as witnesses testified but emotions erupted between council member Kelly Smith Greene and one of the witnesses, Phil Smith, her cousin and the chair of the London Tourism Commission, as she spoke near the end of the hearing during the council’s deliberations. Bailiffs removed Smith, who had earlier defended the $5 million mortgage, which had been sought to support the tourism commission. Weddle supporters cheered him on. 
“You neglected to ever communicate with council members. You came in like a bull in a china shop,” Greene said to Weddle. “You were the boss and you didn’t get our opinion.” 
Other witnesses included Weddle himself, the acting city clerk, a former city clerk, local Housing Authority workers and Chief of Police Bobby Day. Much of the testimony included questions about if Weddle acted appropriately in various situations. 
Some of the charges that fell short of the necessary unanimous approval from  council members alleged that Weddle had erroneously removed members of the London Housing Authority board and had directed the authority’s employees to not follow laws and regulations. 
While on the stand, Weddle expressed concern about another appointment to an office — this time the mayor’s office — that is typically on the ballot. At present, three of the council members have been appointed instead of being elected by citizens.
“People see the chaos in London and I think that both branches (of government) are to blame for some things and we both have to take blame for where it belongs, but one of the biggest chaoses in this city is that people’s voices are not being heard,” Weddle said. 
Former Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Joseph Lambert presided as the hearing officer for Friday’s city council meeting. 
Cameron’s office asks FBI to investigate $202K refunds from Beshear’s campaign, Kentucky Dems

Weddle also has made headlines for his political contributions in support of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear during the 2023 race for governor. The Kentucky Lantern reported in April 2023 that Weddle’s family and associates in the reverse logistics industry had given more than $300,000 to support Beshear, including large contributions from people who had never before made a political donation. The Beshear campaign later returned $202,000 in donations that Weddle had put on his  credit card and that had been made in the names of other people, a violation of campaign finance laws.
The state Registry of Election Finance continues to investigate the donations. The registry staff earlier this year recommended that the board find Weddle unknowingly violated the law. In February, the board unanimously deferred action on that recommendation and asked the registry staff to provide additional information, including about actions of the Beshear campaign and Kentucky Democratic Party.
When Weddle’s excessive contributions came to light during the 2023 primary campaign, then-Attorney Daniel Cameron, who was a Republican candidate for governor, asked the FBI to investigate.
In Laurel County, Weddle has been criticized for his response to a local police shooting in December. London police shot and killed Doug Harless, 63, in his home while serving a warrant for stolen property at the wrong house.

(U.S. Coast Guard Courtesy Photo)The U.S. Coast Guard shadowed two Chinese research ships operating in disputed waters within the Arctic Ocean this week, the Coast Guard announced Wednesday.
The icebreakers Ji Di and Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di were traveling more than 200 miles offshore of Utqiagvik, America’s northernmost town, in what’s known as the “extended continental shelf” under the International Law of the Sea Treaty.
Ordinarily, international law restricts a nation’s fishing, oil drilling and scientific exploration to within 200 nautical miles of its coast, in what’s known as its “exclusive economic zone.” Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a nation can extend that exclusive limit if the continental shelf — a place of generally shallower water — stretches beyond 200 miles.
More than 160 countries and the European Union have ratified the Law of the Sea agreement, but the United States has not, despite the urging of members of Alaska’s congressional delegation.
The agreement says foreign vessels may pass through extended continental shelf waters, but they must have the owner’s consent in order to perform scientific studies or seafloor mapping there.
The United States claims the extended continental shelf near its shorelines and in 2023 began the international process to have its claims recognized, but the United Nations committee that regulates the agreement has not finalized the American claims, a process that could take decades because the United States is not a party to the agreement.
Meanwhile, despite the lack of international recognition, the United States has continued to claim sovereignty over the extended continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean.
In late April, the Trump administration announced that it was beginning to plan oil and gas lease sales in the disputed area. 
China, which operates more Arctic icebreakers than does the United States, has contended that the Arctic Ocean should remain open to free navigation.
This week, when the two Chinese research icebreakers crossed into the disputed area, the Coast Guard dispatched the icebreaker Healy, which was already operating in the Arctic Ocean under a different mission.
“They were pretty close to the standard 200 nautical mile EEZ boundary. They were outside of that by a few miles, which is directly over that portion that is being claimed right now … by the United States,” said Troy Bouffard, director of the Center for Arctic Security and Resilience at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“It’s deliberate in several ways,” he said of the Chinese action. “It’s meant to get attention but not go over the line.”
He said some of China’s actions in the Arctic have been to “promote it as a global commons that belongs to everybody, and to minimize sovereign rights as much as possible. So that’s a pretty obvious reason why they would have done this at the location they did.”
Chief Petty Officer Travis Magee, assistant public affairs officer for the U.S. Coast Guard’s Arctic District, said that in cases like the ones that occurred this week, the typical response is to “monitor, and query the vessels” over the radio, frequently using a pre-prepared script.
The script he said, often goes like this:
“You are currently operating over the United States Extended Continental Shelf (ECS). Under international law, the United States has rights to conserve and manage the living and non-living natural resources of its ECS as well as to regulate marine scientific research by foreign scientists relating to its ECS. In all cases where marine scientific research is pursued on the Extended Continental Shelf, appropriate official channels must be used to obtain U.S. consent.”
The Coast Guard also flew a long-range patrol aircraft from Kodiak to shadow the two ships.
Rear Adm. Bob Little, commander of the Arctic District, said in a prepared statement that “the U.S. Coast Guard is controlling, securing and defending the northern U.S. border and maritime approaches in the Arctic to protect U.S. sovereignty, and Healy’s operations demonstrate the critical need for more Coast Guard icebreakers to achieve that.”
While the U.S. Navy frequently operates submarines in the Arctic Ocean, it does not have any icebreakers; the Coast Guard operates the federal government’s only icebreaking ships.
The recently approved Republican budget package known as the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” included billions of dollars for the Coast Guard to construct new heavy icebreakers. 
The first of those ships is expected to enter service in 2030, though some medium-weight icebreakers are being planned and could arrive sooner.
As an interim measure, the Coast Guard purchased and commissioned an icebreaking oilfield services ship, renaming it the Storis. 
At the time of the Healy’s intercept in the Arctic Ocean, the Storis was conducting training operations in the Bering Sea.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250902-G-G0200-1001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. House of Representatives voted mostly along party lines Wednesday night to repeal development restrictions in large areas of Alaska, Montana and North Dakota.
The House’s vote, which must be duplicated by the Senate before becoming effective, seeks to reverse land management plans adopted in the final days of the Biden administration.
In Alaska, the Central Yukon Resource Management Plan was seen as an obstacle to the proposed 211-mile Ambler Road and the planned trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, proposed the elimination of the plan via the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal regulations under certain circumstances.
“Why is this CRA so important? Revoking Public Land Order 5150 is the first step in allowing the State of Alaska to acquire lands that are critical to two essential projects: Ambler Road and the Alaska LNG pipeline,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas and chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources.
Speaking on the House floor, Begich said he believes the Biden administration’s plan doesn’t represent a balanced approach and would restrict projects that could benefit Alaskans.
“It is federal overreach that is ensuring that Alaska’s wealth stays in the ground, unavailable to the people of one of America’s most impoverished regions,” he said of the portion of Interior Alaska affected by the order.
Doyon Inc., the regional Alaska Native corporation for Interior Alaska, wrote a letter of support for the repeal. Environmental groups and some Alaska Native tribal groups opposed it.
The Bering Sea-Interior Tribal Commission asked Congress to preserve the management plan, as did Protect the Kobuk, an organization opposing Ambler Road.
In a written statement, China Kantner of Protect the Kobuk noted that if federal lands are transferred to the state of Alaska, local hunters will lose subsistence hunting preferences because those are not allowed under the Alaska Constitution.

(Courtesy of MMI)  LINCOLN —  At least 135 Nebraska youths challenged by autism have suffered interrupted services as a result of cuts the state made in August to Medicaid reimbursement rates, according to preliminary findings of a survey by national advocates.
Mariel Fernandez of the Council of Autism Service Providers offered an early peek at the survey during an interim legislative hearing Friday to hear about possible fallout and benefits of the reductions.
Speaking to the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, Fernandez was clear that she does not oppose an adjustment.  Indeed, she said she was shocked to learn how high some of Nebraska’s treatment reimbursements had gotten relative to surrounding states.
Mariel Fernandez of the Council of Autism Service Providers is among speakers who were invited to speak during an interim study hearing before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee. (Screenshot of hearing)
However, Fernandez said that the council members believe the changes DHHS adopted amount to an “overcorrection” and requested that the department conduct further study to prevent negative impacts on access to care or an exacerbation of a worker shortage. 
She said she knows of a couple of service providers already exiting the state. 
Fernandez suggested the state implement an accreditation process to get rid of providers trying to “make a buck because rates are favorable.” Other speakers Friday also suggested better vetting to assist in achieving the committee’s goal: long-term sustainability and elimination of exploitative practices.
 Interim study 

The three-hour hearing at the Capitol was part of an interim study to inform lawmakers how they might help ensure the viability of the state’s Medicaid-funded Applied Behavior Analysis services. Also known as ABA, the therapy and support helps people with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.
The Council of Autism Service Providers has said the Nebraska cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates range from 28% to 79%, depending on the service or therapy.
Only invited guests only spoke during Friday hearing , which was open to the public. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, the HHS committee chair who said he raised a child with an autism disorder, scheduled the hearing following concerns lawmakers fielded from families and others about the impact of the reimbursement rate changes that went into effect Aug. 1.
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. Jan. 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
DHHS said its review showed Nebraska had the highest reimbursement rates of any state ABA program — leading to an increase in state expenses of more than 2,000% since 2020. Five years ago, Nebraska paid about $4.6 million for ABA services. Last year, the amount soared to $85.6 million.
It was an increase HHS’s Matthew Ahern described as the fastest he’s seen in any single program. 
Medicaid-eligible youths served in Nebraska grew from about 169 in 2020 to about 1,150 three years later, DHHS has said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 31 children is affected by autism spectrum disorder, a developmental disability with challenges ranging from social communication to repetitive behaviors.
Hardin said his concerns included “middle men” organizations, which employ people who directly work with the youths, “taking a significant” chunk of the reimbursements. He alleged that some moved to or expanded in Nebraska after seeing a potential for profit-making, fueled by the Legislature’s approval in 2023 of a 17% hike for behavioral health services. 
He referred also to a “troubling absence of background checks” for “registered behavior technicians” who work directly with children. 
“Shall we say … we didn’t exactly mind the farm?” Hardin said. He later added: “How do responsible adults in the room make decisions that are wise without continuing to pay for bad acting and not face a clawback?”

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, another member of the committee, expressed concern about a possible federal clawback of funds, as has happened to a few states whose ABA programs were investigated.
Ahern, the DHHS deputy director, said the “risk is certainly there,” adding that is why the agency tightened its program.

Another speaker, Addie Angelov, CEO of the Indiana-based nonprofit Paramount Health Data Project, spoke about a “blistering” 2024 report of Indiana’s growing ABA program by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General.
The report outlined “audacious” fiscal improprieties, she said, and alleged at least $56 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments. The OIG in that case recommended Indiana refund nearly $40 million to the federal government.
A similar OIG probe of Wisconsin found that the state made at least $18.5 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments for ABA services to youths. Among the OIG’s recommendations was a $12 million refund to the federal government.
Angelov noted that Indiana’s governor established a commission this year to find ways to reduce the rising costs identified in the audit while  maintaining care. She encouraged Nebraska’s HHS legislative committee to consider changes, including holding all entities that serve students with an autism disorder to national standards of best practices, evaluation and auditing. 
She said pediatricians, insurance companies and schools must meet accreditation standards.
“Currently standalone ABA therapy providers are the only entity that does not have a checks and balances in place,” Angelov said. “Vetting these organizations that serve them should be a top priority.”
 ‘All very new’ 

Amy Nordness of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Monroe-Meyer Institute said Medicaid rate reductions won’t stop MMI from providing services to youths on the autism spectrum. 
But, she said services likely would “look different” as a result.

Asked by State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha to elaborate, she said it likely could mean increasing caseload size for supervisors who oversee techs that work directly with the youths.  It also could prompt more diversification of the client base at some clinics to include more non-Medicaid patients.
“What I’m hearing is there might be reduced availability to provide services to folks on Medicaid,” Fredrickson said.
Nordness said that is a possibility, adding that “this is all very new.”
She said the nonprofit MMI — which she described as one of the biggest and oldest developmental disability centers in the world — is not about turning a profit. But it needs to cover costs, she said.
“We have to find the right balance,” said Nordness. Of quality of treatment, she said: “That’s not something we’ll skimp on.”

In front of the Tetons, public land advocates support the Great American Outdoors Act that provides money for public-lands maintenance and permanently funds acquisition of parks and access.
The post Congressional panel hears call for national park funding, restoration of staff appeared first on WyoFile .","With the Tetons as a backdrop, a congressional panel heard testimony Friday in support of reauthorizing the Great American Outdoors Act, which was passed in 2020 to address $12.7 billion in backlogged maintenance on public lands.
Members of the panel, including U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, supported continued funding for the act’s Legacy Restoration Fund that expires this year. But officials need to better distribute the money and also use it to modernize infrastructure in national parks, Hageman said.
“The next iteration of GAOA should concentrate on projects that modernize our parks, enhance public access, improve infrastructure and create new outdoor recreation opportunities,” she said in front of an outdoor audience of about 100 at Grand Teton National Park’s Jenny Lake Plaza.
To date, the act has not “adequately address[ed] some of our smaller parks and the needs that they have, and it disproportionately prioritized urban cities over our rural crown jewels, such as … Grand Teton and Yellowstone national park[s],” she said.
“There’s magic in this place because of these people.” Chip Jenkins
While the committee focused on the Act’s Legacy Restoration Fund, one witness said the act’s good work could not properly continue without restoring drastic staffing cuts to the National Park Service that have occurred since President Donald Trump took office.
“I also came here to warn you that we won’t be able to continue this success without the planners, engineers, compliance officers, budget experts, landscape architects, maintenance staff, carpenters and so many more Park Service staff who make it possible for the Great American Outdoors Act to fund the work on the ground,” said Kristen Brengel, a senior vice president with the National Parks Conservation Association. “The Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent workforce since January.”
The committee should advocate for restoring Park Service staff and prohibiting further cuts, she said.
‘Magic in this place’
Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins drew applause after he choked up while testifying about the partnerships that enabled the park to undertake numerous projects that benefit visitors. Those range from construction of a modern visitors’ center to upgraded trailhead parking lots and entrance stations and preservation of more than 1,200 acres of parkland once owned by Wyoming.
“There’s magic in this place because of these people,” he said, referring to local residents, politicians and nonprofit groups who work with park staff. “I think there’s something the committee can learn about the way we work together to be stewards of this place.”
Grand Teton needs help, he said.
“Our infrastructure is not always adequate for current visitation numbers, let alone for increasing future levels,” he said. Grand Teton sorely needs to upgrade Colter Bay Village on the shores of Jackson Lake, a place that attracts up to 11,000 people a day.

“The infrastructure is suffering from over 75 years of wear and tear, and is not meeting our visitors’ needs nor matching the beauty that is Colter Bay,” Jenkins said. “We need to make sure the toilets flush,” he said, calling for “wholesale rejuvenation” of cabins, a restaurant, marina and campground.
With GAOA modernization funds, Grand Teton also would improve pullouts near the Oxbow Bend of the Snake River, haunt of the late world-famous mother grizzly 399. The park would build a bicycle path to connect the park’s largest campground — the Gros Ventre Campground — to the valley’s bicycle trail network.
“The park welcomes close to 4 million visitors annually,” Jenkins said, “and this year, we’re on track to have our second busiest year on record.”
On a post-Labor Day Friday, 157 vehicles overflowed from the Jenny Lake parking area and parked on the sides of the highway to the south. Perhaps a similar number overflowed to the north. Eighty-eight vehicles were queued up at the Moose entrance station at noon, their drivers waiting to show passes or pay fees.
World-class plaza
Reauthorizing the Great American Outdoors Act “can sharpen” an existing partnership between the Grand Teton National Park Foundation and the park, foundation president Leslie Mattson told the panel. About $15 million in private funds augmented $6 million from the feds to upgrade the park’s spotlight draw, where the hearing took place.
Jenny Lake was once a dusty crossroads of trails and desultory log buildings, “marked by congestion and confusion,” Mattson said. “The most commonly asked questions were ‘where is the lake?’ and ‘where is the bathroom?’”
The upgrade created “a world-class, accessible visitor plaza and a sustainable network of backcountry trails that welcomes millions each year,” she said.
Drawing people to Grand Teton and Jackson Hole only to disappoint them with a shabby experience is counterproductive, said Julie Calder, chair of the Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board. A vice president at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, she advocated for renewal of the act.
Members of the Travel and Tourism Board often say they are in “the dreaming phase,” of visitors’ journeys, she said. “We create a lot of content to make people dream about coming here. We want to ensure that when they arrive, they get the experience that they had hoped for when they dream[ed].”
A wildlife guide who built a small business told the panel how companies like his rely on park infrastructure. Taylor Phillips started Jackson Hole EcoTour Adventures in 2008 and now has 40 employees and a payroll approaching $2 million, he said. His company is one of 70 that last year introduced more than 81,000 visitors to the park, he said.
He pointed to GAOA funds that improved the rural Moose-Wilson road as a worthy investment. Before the improvement, a 260-mile round trip to Yellowstone ended over 10 miles of jarring potholes — “not a lasting impression you want to leave with our guests.”
Brengel, the National Parks Conservation Association representative, reiterated the need for a restored park service staff nationwide.
“It takes people to run the park,” she said. The parks “won’t be protected and preserved without the dedicated staff who honor and care for them.”

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Trump administration is moving to partially lift a blanket federal prohibition on cellphone jamming, FCC Chair Brendan Carr said Friday — a move in line with efforts led by Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton to allow the practice via legislation.
Cotton, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an afternoon press conference they are primarily interested in targeting prison inmates who use contraband cellphones to commit crimes. Carr said he’s ready to oblige via a rule change.
Federal law prohibits states or individuals from “willfully or maliciously” interfering with “licensed or authorized” radio communications — such as a cellphone.
“Over the years the FCC has authorized various different technologies to try to identify contraband cell phones and shut them down,” Carr said at the press conference. “They’ve worked in some cases, they have not worked in other cases. Other countries — and the federal government — have authority to jam within their facilities, but state and local officials have been denied that ability.
Carr said the long-standing federal ban was due to a “misreading” of law. The FCC will vote on a proposed rule at the end of the month that would change this.

“What we can do at the federal level is we authorize communications or we don’t authorize communications, and so what we’re going to do is we’re going to deauthorize the lawful use of contraband cell phones within the confines of prisons,” Carr said. “So once contraband cellphone use is not an authorized communication, then the federal law is no longer a prohibition to jamming it.”
The work-around, Griffin said, will allow prison officials to target illicit cellphone use that “kill[s] and endanger[s]” people.
“It may not be a silver bullet, it may not be the right fit for every facility, but there are certainly lots and lots of facilities around this country where this type of solution will and can make a significant difference,” Carr said.
Cellphones are typically considered contraband in state prison systems, and Arkansas officials and Carr said they are being used by violent criminals to order hits and other crimes against people on the outside. A memo addressed to Arkansas Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne provided to the Advocate by both the Department of Corrections and the attorney general’s office outlined how illicit cellphones contribute to gang violence inside and outside state prisons.
According to the memo written by Maj. Randy Shores of the division’s Office of Emergency Services, Arkansas prisons currently incarcerate 230 “Serious Threat Group leaders” who have been found with a cellphone 308 times.
“These 230 inmates are from all the known threat groups housed in the department including Bloods, Crips, Aryan Circle, White Aryan Resistance along with our largest group Gangster Disciples,” Shores wrote in the undated memo. “Further investigation led us to several incidents involving confiscated cellphones where these same inmates’ information was found … showing evidence of conducting illegal activities such as drug movement, drone activities, the movement of money and gang activities throughout not only the state of Arkansas but across the United States.”
Rand Champion, a corrections department spokesperson, confirmed that the state had observed a trend between cellphone confiscations and increased gang violence within the prisons.
A photo shown by Griffin that he said was taken at the Arkansas Department of Corrections’ Varner Unit showed dozens of cellphones, which he said had been confiscated from inmates.
Griffin said incarcerated people will have the devices smuggled to them via drone drops and that there have been numerous instances of inmates extorting Arkansans using illicit phones.
“I recall telling the story of an inmate who was contacting another inmate’s mother on the phone and saying, ‘If you don’t get us this money, we’re going to kill your son,’” Griffin said. “No credible person disputes the heinous crimes that are being committed with these cellphones.”
Cotton has been pushing legislation to allow cellphone jamming within corrections facilities and is the lead sponsor for the proposed Cellphone Jamming Reform Act. He has introduced the bill on at least two occasions, including once this past March, but it has never moved out of a Senate committee.
The proposed rule, Cotton said, will make it so that “contraband cellphones will be nothing more than dead paperweights inside our prisons.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order guiding the allocation of more than $430 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to projects that would “benefit wildlife habitat, improve water quality and provide flood protection while creating new recreational opportunities.”
“The Land and Water Conservation Fund continues to deliver on its promise to connect Americans to the outdoors while protecting the landscapes that make our nation special,” said Burgum in a statement.
But local conservation groups say the changes threaten to undermine the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2020, which contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to the development and rehabilitation of parks, conservation areas and outdoor recreation facilities across the nation.
Conservation groups said language in the order restricts the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from using the fund to acquire additional land that could be used to expand recreation and conservation. 
Those restrictions could effectively prevent the expansion of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails administered by the BLM. 
“Nevada is approximately 86% public land, of which 67% is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. If you have enjoyed some form of outdoor recreation in Nevada, there is a good chance it was on BLM managed land. If you have camped, hiked, OHV’ed or hunted in Nevada, it was likely in or near a National Conservation Area or National Monument,” said Russell Kuhlman, executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation.
The order would also allow states to use the conservation fund to buy federal property, including protected federal conservation land. Those changes could open the door to land transfers that shift public land to private ownership, said the Nevada Conservation League.
“Nevadans overwhelmingly support protecting these places, and we cannot afford to roll back decades of progress in opening and protecting access to the great outdoors,” said Kristee Watson, Executive Director of the Nevada Conservation League.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund has pumped more than $175 million into acquiring and improving public land at Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe, according to the Nevada Conservation League.
The order also “increased bureaucratic red tape” by requiring both state governors and local county officials to approve land acquisitions purchased using the fund, said the Nevada Wildlife Federation. 
Local conservation groups warned the restrictions could prevent new investments in the outdoor recreation economy and halt pending land deals and projects.
In 2023, Nevada’s outdoor recreation industry accounted for $8.1 billion in value-added (GDP) annually, ranking the state 10th in the nation, according to the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation. 
The Department of the Interior did, however, back away from earlier plans to include language that would siphon money away from conservation land purchases to pay for maintenance projects on federal property.
“Fortunately,” the order does not include one of the administration’s worst ideas, leaving out its prior proposal to divert LWCF funding for unauthorized purposes,” said Amy Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition.
Lindholm continued, “Unfortunately, Secretarial Order 3442 still does real damage.  It hinders critical conservation and public access by reviving previously rejected ideas.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Avi-Kwa-Ame-National-Monument-1024x658.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

The change comes as insurers grapple with the costs of drugs like Ozempic, which are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1s. That drug class is one of Idaho’s fastest-growing expenses for the state insurance plan, officials say.
“Current evidence does not justify continued coverage of these medications at current usage levels and pricing,” officials wrote.
Almost 27,000 people are enrolled in Idaho’s state government health insurance plans. 
Examples of medications that won’t be covered for weight-loss in Idaho include Wegovy, Saxenda and Zepbound. The policy applies for any GLP-1 medication prescribed mainly for weight loss. But coverage will not be affected for drugs in that class that are prescribed to treat diabetes.
Earlier this year, Idaho’s health insurance premiums for state employees rose sharply, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Officials said the rise was largely driven by rising health care costs and the types of services people seek.

Like Portland, voters in those cities skew heavily toward Democratic candidates.A television report Thursday night alerted him to supposed rampant violence in Portland, he said. He also possibly alluded to weeks-long protests in the city after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. Those protests, which sometimes included clashes with police, ended in 2020.“I didn't know that was continuing to go on, but Portland is unbelievable,” he said. “The destruction of the city. Well, I'm going to look at it now, because I didn't know that was still going on. This has been going on for years. So we'll be able to stop that very easily.”Trump, without offering evidence, described the city as beset by “paid terrorists” who smokebomb stores.“And when we go there, if we go to Portland, we're going to wipe them out,” he said. “They're going to be gone, and they're going to be gone bad. They won't even stand the fight. They will not stay there. They're ruined. They've ruined that city.“What they’ve done to that city, it’s like living in hell,” he added.Another National Guard deployment comingTrump’s opining on the state of Oregon’s largest city was part of his answer to a reporter’s question about if he had chosen the next city where he would send National Guard troops.The president said he would send troops to another city and had decided which one, but was not ready to announce it.“I'm not going to say it now, but yeah, I have” decided, he said. “We're going to go into another place and straighten it out.”Trump has said the deployment to Los Angeles was meant to subdue protests over the administration’s immigration crackdown, while the troops in the District of Columbia were there to control crime, despite a 30-year-low violent crime rate in the nation’s capital.California Gov. Gavin Newsom and District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb have sued Trump over the deployments.Newsom won a decision Tuesday, with U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruling that Trump used military personnel as law enforcement in violation of an 18th-century law banning military personnel from conducting law enforcement, as well as a more fundamental principle of U.S. democracy.The administration has not responded to Schwalb’s suit, which was filed Thursday.",,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

The monument — titled the Snow Country Prison Japanese American Internment Memorial — displays the names of the 1,850 Japanese Americans who were detained on the property.
It’s named after a haiku written by Itaru Ina, who was held prisoner there from 1945 to 1946.
Before the tribal college in Bismarck existed, the property was known as the Fort Lincoln military post. It was used as a prison camp for Japanese Americans and German nationals during World War II.

Many of the Japanese Americans who were sent to Fort Lincoln were community leaders who had spoken out against their imprisonment and were pressured to renounce their citizenship. 
The effort to create a memorial on the campus was spearheaded by Itaru Ina’s daughter, Satsuki Ina, who is also a survivor of the incarceration program. She was born at Tule Lake, a detention camp in California, in 1944.
Satsuki Ina said the monument is a commitment to remember the unconstitutional detention of Japanese Americans, even when their stories went untold for decades.
“It’s an act of dissidence,” she said.
There is little public recognition about what the prisoners had suffered, speakers at the dedication noted.
“It’s a story that very few people in our own community knew very much about,” said Barbara Takei, another Japanese American activist who spoke during the dedication. “In the broader community, even fewer people know about it.”

The Revs. Ronald Kobata and Duncan Ryūken Williams led attendees in a Buddhist ritual to honor the Fort Lincoln prisoners, especially those who died during their incarceration. 
“A memorial like the Snow Country Prison Japanese American Internment Memorial helps us to feel the presence of all those who experienced wartime incarceration,” Williams said during the dedication.
Williams created a book containing the names of all 125,284 people of Japanese ancestry incarcerated in the United States during the war. The book, called the Ireichō, was part of the dedication ceremony and is on display at United Tribes Technical College Friday and Saturday.
New monument honors Japanese Americans incarcerated in North Dakota during World War II

Several speakers drew parallels between the experience of Japanese Americans during World War II and the U.S. government’s persecution of Native nations.
“In both cases, U.S. authorities exercised a paternalistic rationale justifying forced relocation as protective or necessary,” United Tribes Technical College President Russ McDonald said.
Many also compared the imprisonment of Japanese Americans to the modern-day immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration.
The law used to justify their incarceration during World War II — the Alien Enemies Act — is the same one the Trump administration invoked to arrest and deport Venezuelan immigrants. (An appeals court on Tuesday ruled against Trump’s use of the law, though the matter is likely to also go before the U.S. Supreme Court.)
“To me, it just shows how vulnerable we are,” Kobata said in an interview before the ceremony. “Stop repeating history. We know that the Constitution isn’t this thing that’s so dependable.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.More than 1,400 service workers across the University of Minnesota’s five campuses could strike after they rejected the university’s “last, best and final” offer on a new labor contract.
The Teamsters Local 320, the union representing cooks, groundskeepers and other service workers, urged their members to vote down the offer which they said fell far short in raising wages and protecting benefits.
“A system-wide strike remains an option as we maneuver through the next several days and talk to members,” said Brian Aldes, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 320, in a statement announcing the vote results Friday. “The ball is now in the university’s court to make this right or face a work stoppage.”
The university’s offer included $1,000 bonuses over the next two years; at least 3% wage increases in the first year and 2% in the second; and additional market adjustments ranging from 0.5% to 2% depending on the job and seniority. The proposal also included pay increases for shifts that begin early in the morning or end late at night.
The union said to avoid the strike the university must raise wages at least 3.5% a year.
The average unionized service worker makes $26.11 per hour, according to the union, which is about $11 per hour less than the median wage in Minnesota.
Federal budget cuts and rising costs have strained university budgets across the country, leading the University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents to approve the largest tuition hike in over a decade while cutting spending by 7% on academics, student services and research.
“Unlike many of our peer institutions, which are also facing financial challenges, the university has invested in our people and allocated a significant pool for salary increases for faculty and staff for the upcoming fiscal year. While we do not want a strike, we are prepared to continue vital services to our students, faculty, and staff if the Teamsters choose to strike,” Ken Horstman, vice president for human resources, said in a statement on Friday.
Service workers at the university also authorized a strike three years ago, but called it off after reaching an agreement that raised the minimum hourly wage from $15 to $20.
In announcing their intention to strike, the union boasted of its large strike fund that would allow its members — many living paycheck-to-paycheck — to forgo wages and walk the picket line in the event of a protracted strike. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters approved enhanced strike benefits for University of Minnesota members of $1,000 per week, which exceeds the weekly pay of many members, the union said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P1116670-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune) Attorneys for the Utah Legislature and plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit against the state have agreed on a timeline to redraw Utah’s congressional boundaries. 
Third District Judge Dianna Gibson tossed out Utah’s 2021 congressional map in a ruling she issued last week that determined the Utah Legislature unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. 
Attorneys for both the Legislature and the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit’s plaintiffs agreed on the following deadlines, according to a court filing submitted Thursday: 
GOP legislative leaders begrudgingly say they’ll redraw Utah’s congressional map, as court ordered


Sept. 25: The Utah Legislature will publish its new proposed map. 
Sept. 26 to Oct. 5: Lawmakers will hold a public comment period to take input on the map.
Oct. 6: The Legislature will take a final vote on the map and submit it to the court for consideration. Plaintiffs will also have the same deadline to submit any proposed maps to the judge. 
Oct. 17: The deadline for both parties to file briefs, expert reports, and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary. 
Oct. 23 to Oct. 24: The court will hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. 
Oct. 28: The deadline for parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the court, if necessary. 
Nov. 10: The latest possible date for the court to select a final map, according to the lieutenant governor’s office. 

Previously, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office had told the judge the latest a new map could be adopted would be Nov. 1, in order to give county clerks enough time to finalize precincts before candidates can begin filing in January. 
However, earlier this week during a status conference, Gibson asked if there would be any flexibility — even if it’s a matter of days — to push back her previously proposed schedule to give lawmakers more time to submit their maps. In her initial order last week, the judge proposed that deadline to be Sept. 24. 
The lieutenant governor’s attorneys said in another court filing earlier this week that they could push the Nov. 1 deadline to Nov. 10. 
Additionally, Gibson had included in her initial order the opportunity for “third parties” — in addition to the Legislature and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs — to submit proposed maps. However, in their joint court filing, attorneys for both parties said they “agree that map submissions to the Court should be limited to the existing parties in this case.” 
“Third parties have the opportunity to submit proposed maps and comments during the legislative process,” they wrote in Thursday’s filing.

Preliminary damage estimates in the federal request exceed $39 million. The state declaration for high winds, heavy rain and flooding had estimated losses at $24 million, though a Nebraska Emergency Management Agency spokesperson said the estimate was likely to grow.
The NEMA spokesperson said that after state and local officials conducted joint preliminary damage assessments with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the state was able to substantiate federal funding eligibility for the 12 counties. Those counties are: Burt, Douglas, Fillmore, Lancaster, Nemaha, Nuckolls, Saline, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Washington and Webster.
The 11 counties covered only by the state disaster declaration are: Butler, Cass, Dodge, Gage, Harlan, Jefferson, Johnson, Otoe, Pawnee, Sarpy and York.
The August storms detailed in the federal request damaged schools, public facilities, businesses and power infrastructure, particularly hundreds of power poles, transformers and electrical lines. Fallen power lines or trees and flooding also forced road closures. One woman died in the storms, and a man was severely injured at Two Rivers State Recreation Area.
The Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln lost the roofs of two housing units, displacing 387 inmates, 137 of whom were sent to temporary housing at Omaha and Tecumseh facilities. The units are expected to be operational by late September, according to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services. 
A NEMA spokesperson had said some damage to the prison, after insurance, may be eligible under state disaster aid. If approved, federal disaster funding could cover costs associated with repairs to and replacement of public infrastructure, according to the Governor’s Office.

A slate of new laws are empowering the Green Mountain Care Board to tackle high executive compensation and health care costs ahead of its mid-September decision on hospital budgets.

Vermont’s independent health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, is considering a set of recommendations that would place tighter guardrails on expenses run rampant across the University of Vermont Health Network. The board’s staff presented the recommendations at its Wednesday meeting, a precursor to the board’s annual hospital budget decisions due Sept. 15. 
New laws passed this legislative session bolstered the care board’s ability to specifically tackle compensation for health care executives and the structure of network health operations, like UVM Health Network. Gov. Phil Scott, who signed these laws, released a statement Thursday commending the care board’s efforts to lower the overall cost of health care in the state. 
“In recent years, GMCB regulatory review has identified concerns with University of Vermont Health Network operations, and lack of alignment between executive compensation and State healthcare goals,” board chair Owen Foster told VTDigger in a statement following the hearing.  “This budget cycle GMCB’s staff has accordingly conducted a deeper dive and analysis of these issues and yesterday made recommendations to the Board.” 
Specifically, during its Wednesday presentation the care board staff illustrated the extreme income disparities between the UVM Medical Center and other hospitals owned by its parent company, the UVM Health Network. The network owns three hospitals in Vermont (UVM, Porter, and Central Vermont Medical Centers), three in New York, and a number of additional health care facilities in the region. 
UVMMC is the largest hospital in the network. Its budgeted revenue for 2026 is $2.4 billion, while Central Vermont’s is $318 million and Porter’s $142 million. 
In 2020-24, losses across the UVM Network reached $12.8 million, according to the board staff’s presentation. Still, the UVM Medical Center alone contributed more than $138 million in profit to the network during this period, the report also showed. Two of the three  New York hospitals in the network operated at a deficit. Of its proposed budgets for next fiscal year, UVMMC accounts for nearly 95% of the systemwide operating income. 
“The Health Network has made excess revenue margin here in Vermont, and the Health Network has needed to contribute those dollars to the New York Hospitals. Vermonters are paying for keeping those New York hospitals afloat,” explained Mike Fisher, the state’s health care advocate, in an interview with VTDigger after the budget hearing.
Exactly what can the board do to curb that disparity? “I’m not exactly sure,” Fisher said, but he was heartened to see the board make strides to pull hospital costs down, to be closer in line with what insurers will be able to pay them. 
To understand the hospital budgets, it’s important to understand the insurance rate review. The two are deeply interconnected. In August, as part of this review process, the Green Mountain Care Board, approved moderate premium increases for health insurers selling plans on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. These rates influence how much hospitals can bill insurers for their services. 
Insurance rate review and hospital budgets are two sides of one equation, Fisher explained. “Insurance rate review is ‘how much money do you have to spend?’ Hospital budget [review] is analogous to ‘Where are you going to spend those dollars?’” he said.
“In years past those two sides of the equation haven’t added up. The board has allowed for more spending than it raised (through insurance payments),” he added.
For the coming fiscal year, the board recommended a commercial reimbursement rate reduction of 7.3% for UVMMC, as well as reductions to net patient revenue and expenses. It also recommended rate increases for Porter and Central Vermont Medical Centers of 2.9% (down, for both, from a proposed 3%) and budget reductions commensurate with reductions in net patient revenue.
The staff recommendations came after Mike Smith, who leads an independent liaison team,  delivered a scathing letter to the UVMHN Board, UVMMC Board and Green Mountain Care Board on Aug. 29, calling out the network’s proposed budget narrative. He outlined that UVMNH’s claims that it is working to improve affordability grossly conflict with the numbers on the page. While the network put forth lower rates, it outlined increases in use and type of services that more than offset that reduction.
Because of this, commercial insurers will see a nearly $46 million increase in what they pay the UVMMC in 2026, Smith writes, despite the $76 million reduction in rates. 
Smith’s letter also raised the concern that the care board outlined, stating that the medical center “was paying more than its fair share of network costs,” especially by lending money to the network’s New York hospitals. The network has made a net $68.9 million in loans to the New York hospitals between 2015 and 2013, Smith cites, adding that UVMMC and UVMHN invested an additional $20 million as part of an affiliation agreement, population health initiatives and capital investments. 
In response to the letter, UVM Health Network spokesperson Annie Mackin wrote that the “University of Vermont Health Network worked hard to submit budgets for FY ’26 that complied with GMCB guidance, and which took into account the increasing need of our patients for health care services and the increased expenses involved in providing care. However, much work remains, and we and our partners will need to continue taking steps to improve affordability not just in this budget cycle, but in the months and years ahead. We look forward to further digging into the questions and ideas the liaison team have raised.”
Regarding the concerns about the cost burden of the network’s New York hospitals, she said, “Our health care partners in northern New York contribute real benefits to Vermonters – from the care they provide, to the positive economic impact when patients from Plattsburgh or Elizabethtown seek specialized treatment in Burlington,” adding that the two New York hospitals in the red are “making meaningful progress toward stability.”
The liaison’s letter and the care board staff both also looked critically at executive compensation in the UVM network. For 14 executive positions at the network, they budgeted an average 9% increase — nearly a $50,000 average increase from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, care board staff outlined. The liaison’s letter cited that rates of employee benefits have outpaced average cost growth in the past five years  across all three Vermont hospitals — nearly doubling at the medical center. In response, Mackin added that the health network compensates “all staff, regardless of their position, at market rates that help us recruit and retain the people we need to provide high quality care.”
Overall, expenses at the medical center have grown 9.8% annually between 2019 and 2024 — far outpacing the annual inflation rate for that same period.
“The UVMHN must focus on affordability both in its words and in its budget submissions.
Concrete steps must be taken to bring this budget and future ones in line with an agreed affordability metric that pertains to Vermont and Vermonters,” Smith wrote in the letter.
In the coming days the care board intends to deliberate and evaluate the proposed budgets and its staff recommendations, before beginning voting next week. The fiscal year for hospitals runs Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The care board must establish a budget for each hospital by Sept. 15.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana environmental group plans to file a citizen-led federal lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply for the contamination of land and waterways from recent explosions of petrochemical tanks at a Tangipahoa Parish industrial facility. 
The Louisiana Environmental Action Network, represented by the New Orleans-based Waltzer Wygul & Garside law firm, sent Smitty’s a 60-day notice to inform the company it intends to sue for violations of Clean Water Act. The federal law requires the advance notice so that the public is made aware of the legal action. 
The Aug. 22 explosion dispersed an oily residue onto neighboring homes, businesses and a nearby elementary school, and firefighting crews have battled flareups at the site for 15 days running. 
“The fire has been 98% (contained) for over a week,” Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller said in an email. “The reason for the 2% is there is still a possibility of small flare-ups as the burned building and remaining materials are manipulated to find all of the hot spots.”
Smitty’s Supply sells industrial oils and lubricants and employed over 400 people before the incident destroyed the facility. 
The cause of the explosion remains under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, whose crews continue to clean nearby contaminated land and waterways, including the Tangipahoa River that feeds into Lake Pontchartrain.  
The EPA reported Tuesday it had recovered more than 2.15 million gallons of petroleum material mixed with water. It also said contaminated materials had not reached Lake Pontchartrain.     
In a news release, LEAN executive director Marylee Orr described its lawsuit notice as a “first step designed to give the community a seat at the table, if they need it, when plans and decisions are being made to respond to the disaster.”
Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
A Clean Water Act citizen lawsuit will not allow individuals affected by the explosion to obtain any monetary damages, Orr said. Rather, it provides them access to extensive information about the accident, and they can ask the court to force Smitty’s to fully clean up the contamination. 
EPA takes over hazardous material cleanup after Tangipahoa industrial fire

The lawsuit could also result in additional environmental projects to improve the quality of the Tangipahoa River, LEAN’s news release said. 
Orr said her organizations decided to take action after hearing from Amite-area residents who are unhappy about having to do some of the clean-up work themselves. 
As of Friday, 15 days after the incident, 24-hour cleanup and firefighting operations continue, though officials reported no flareups occurred overnight, suggesting the blaze may be close to being extinguished, according to a statement from the Tangipahoa Parish Government. 
Smitty’s Supply has been previously cited for Clean Water Act violations for releasing contaminants into public drainage areas, including oil, grease, fecal coliform and carbon compounds such as methane and ethanol. The company has been fined more than $161,000 since 2021, according to the EPA’s website. 
In June, Smitty’s was non-compliant under its operating permit for exceeding limits on grease, oil and other pollutants discharged into the Tangipahoa River, according to Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records. The company had to block off the affected areas with containment boom and clean it up with vacuum trucks. 
On June 2, a resident who lives near Smitty’s called the state agency to report a strong gas smell and a loud machinery noise coming from the plant, records show. The caller said the odor filled his house as soon as he opened the door and lasted for a few days. The records indicate an LDEQ inspector traveled to the site on June 5 and again on June 17 but found nothing out of the ordinary.
When asked for comment Friday about the Smitty’s investigation, LDEQ referred questions to the EPA, which took over as the lead responding agency a day after the explosion.

“Last year was a decent year for pheasant hunting,” Bogenschutz said in a press release from DNR. “2023 was a good year for pheasant hunting. This year could be excellent.”

2023 and 2024 were two of the best pheasant harvest seasons in the past two decades. Hunters bagged an estimated 460,000 roosters in 2024 and 590,000 roosters in 2023. The harvest figures were consistent with DNR’s observed population decline from 2023 to 2024. 
This year DNR staff reported 1,038 pheasant broods – 338 more than last year. 
Bogenschutz said there were fewer chicks-per-hen that survived this year, but the high number of nests “offset the drop.” 
He said the mild winter — according to the report the fourth-least-snowy winter in 138 years of records — was also helpful in preserving population this year.
“Our adult hen survival was excellent; our adult rooster survival was excellent,” Bogenschutz said in the release. “That really drove the population increase.”
DNR staff from across the state conduct the August roadside survey on more than 200 30-mile routes. Staff drive the gravel roads early in the morning and count the hens, or female pheasants, as they move their broods out of the dew. 
This year, staff observed a statewide average of 28 birds per route, which according to the press release, is the highest count since 2005. Last year’s average was about 20 per route. 
According to the report, the northern regions, central and southeast regions have the “best overall” population densities, but it said “hunters in all regions should see more birds in 2025.” 
In addition to ring-necked pheasant, DNR staff count bobwhite quail, gray partridge and cottontail rabbit while driving the gravel roads. 
The mild winter was also a benefit to these populations which all had population increases from last year. 
Quail populations more than doubled from last year, with a 123% statewide average increase. Partridge populations increased 19% statewide and rabbit populations increased 41%, according to DNR’s report. 
The report also notes the importance of acreage in the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, which gives landowners an incentive to establish and maintain perennial cover over part of their cropland. 
“The CRP has become critical for Iowa pheasant populations with the loss of small grains and hay lands to corn and soybean production,” the report said. 
CRP acres serve as habitat for the birds, and DNR records show enrollment in the program has impacted pheasant populations. 
According to the report, which cites USDA figures, the number of acres enrolled in CRP is the lowest in the program’s history. Iowa had more than 1.67 million acres enrolled as of June 2025, but 727,000 of those acres are set to expire by fall of 2027, according to the report. 
“Iowa will cease to be a major pheasant hunting state if the CRP is significantly diminished,” the report said. 
Pheasant season begins Oct. 25 and runs through Jan. 10, 2026, though those 15 and younger can start a weekend earlier during the youth season Oct. 18-19.
Last year, an estimated 77,400 hunters chased after pheasant in Iowa. That’s close to the number that partook in Iowa’s first-ever hunting season, Oct. 20-22 in 1925, when 75,000 hunters set out with a three-rooster limit for a half day of hunting.
DNR said in the release that 2025 hunters can expect a “banner year.”
Hunters can celebrate the centennial of the sport with commemorative apparel and license design available online.

((Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The New Mexico Department of Health on Friday announced residents will be able to more easily access COVID-19 vaccines at state pharmacies, following updated protocols from the state Board of Pharmacy.
Last week, DOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie issued a public health order directing the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
That order stemmed from “some pharmacies announcing they cannot administer the vaccine in New Mexico unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has yet to convene and act on the matter,” a news release noted.
NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source New Mexico earlier this week that many of the vaccines administered in the state are done so through its pharmacies, which are governed by a protocol established by the Pharmacy Board and others that essentially requires the pharmacies to follow the ACIP guidelines in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. Lacking the ACIP guidelines, Smelser noted, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
NM Board of Pharmacy expected to release new protocol for COVID-19 vaccines this week

The revised protocols, announced Friday, mean “pharmacists can prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines using state health department guidelines instead of waiting for federal recommendations,” a health department news release said.
“This action will ensure New Mexicans have access to the vaccine if they choose,” New Mexico Board of Pharmacy Executive Director and Chief Drug Inspector Cheranne McCracken said in a statement, adding the New Mexico Pharmacists Association played an important role in the protocol update. “It provides pharmacists statewide with the clarity and guidance to provide COVID-19 vaccines.”
A statement from Sid Tenneti, senior vice president of retail pharmacy CVS Health confirmed the new protocol will allow access.
“Following today’s regulatory action by the New Mexico Department of Health, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” Tenneti said in a statement. “Appointments can be scheduled online via CVS.com, through the CVS Health app, or patients can walk into our pharmacies and clinics.”
The New Mexico Department of Health recommends COVID-19 vaccination for:

Anyone 65 and older.
People ages 2–64 who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness.
Any New Mexico resident who wants to be vaccinated.

Read the complete guidelines here.
“We are committed to ensuring access for those who wish to be vaccinated and our collaborative work with the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy demonstrates a swift resolution to remove barriers,” DeBlassie said in a statement. “As the fall/winter respiratory virus season rapidly approaches, New Mexico cannot afford to wait for the federal government to act on this matter.”
Earlier this week, prior to the new protocols being released on Friday, several state medical systems confirmed to Source NM this week availability of the COVID-19 vaccine for patients
“At Presbyterian, we support efforts to provide vaccines to New Mexicans,” Presbyterian Healthcare Services VP and Chief Pharmacy Officer Erica Downing said in a statement. “We continue to work through state and federal requirements and expect to be able to prescribe COVID vaccines for our patients and administer COVID vaccines in our facilities.”

“CHRISTUS St. Vincent has received its first shipment of the Pfizer Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccines,” a statement provided to Source said. “The vaccines will initially be offered in our clinics and in our outpatient pharmacy to adults 65 and older, and individuals ages 5 through 64 who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19.”

“Generally speaking—If a patient asks for a COVID vaccine, we’ll provide it, assuming we have the supply,” a UNM Health spokesperson said.

Of them, 898 are at “high risk” of facing financial difficulties, including closure, according to the Center for American Progress analysis, due to the cuts contained in a recent federal spending bill. 
The recently enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” also known as H.R.1, cut federal SNAP benefits, imposed work requirements and passed certain costs on to states. While the cuts have not yet gone into effect, New Mexico officials predict that the state’s 450,000 SNAP recipients will lose at least some benefits and 40,000 people will lose benefits entirely.
New Mexico has the highest percentage of SNAP recipients in the country. 
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) told Source New Mexico this week that the cuts to SNAP will have wide-ranging impacts on not just recipients, but also retailers and farmers, especially in rural areas. He said he knows of a couple of rural grocers that receive more than three-quarters of their income from customers who use SNAP. 
Vasquez warns Republican SNAP cuts will hit rural areas hardest

Back in May, Center for American Progress researchers sought to quantify how many retailers might be in trouble if SNAP cuts went into effect. They determined that more than 27,000 retailers nationwide were at “high risk” of losing significant revenue. 
The authors deemed a particular retailer “high risk” based on two factors: One, if it was in a county with SNAP participation rates in the top 10% of counties; and, two, whether the retailer was one of relatively few in that county. 
The New Mexico Health Care Authority does not maintain its own list of retailers that heavily rely on SNAP, according to spokesperson Marina Pina. Her office also did not immediately respond to Source’s request for comment on the Center for American Progress’ methodology.
However, authority officials recently told lawmakers that they predict retailers across the state will lose $1.3 billion in revenue as a result of the cuts.
According to the center’s data, the “high-risk” retailers lie in 18 counties, mostly in rural areas. The most “high-risk” retailers (154) operate in Doña Ana County, with 125 in San Juan County and 83 in Lea County. 
The “high risk” retailers include 445 convenience stores, 42 farmers markets and 51 grocery stores, along with 267 retailers classified as “other.”

,DC,2025-09-05 22:01:15+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump signs order to change name of Department of Defense to Department of War,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-order-change-name-department-defense-department-war,,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War.Just before Trump signed the order in the Oval Office late Friday afternoon, he and Pete Hegseth, the secretary in charge of the department, who stood next to Trump during the signing, said the renaming reflected their intention to return to a more aggressive mindset for the military.“It's restoring, as you've guided us to, Mr. President, restoring the warrior ethos,” Hegseth said. “The War Department is going to fight decisively, not endless conflicts. It's going to fight to win, not not to lose. We're going to go on offense, not just on defense. Maximum lethality, not tepid legality. Violent effect, not politically correct. We're going to raise up warriors, not just defenders.”A text of the order was not immediately available Friday.Defense Department historyThe Department of War and the Department of the Navy were Cabinet departments from the nation's founding until 1947, when Congress combined them, along with the Department of the Air Force, into a new National Military Establishment. Congress changed that name to the Defense Department two years later.Trump said Friday that renaming 76 years ago revealed a “political correctness” in the military that contributed to poorer results on the battlefield. The U.S. has not won a major war since the reorganization, he said.“We could have won every war, but we really chose to be very politically correct or wokey, and we just fight forever and then, we wouldn't lose, really, we just fight to sort of tie,” he said. “We never wanted to win wars that every one of them we would have won easily with just a couple of little changes or a couple of little edicts.”Congress to be asked to actBecause the department’s name came from an act of Congress, it’s unclear if Trump has the power to rename it with an executive order. The president said Friday he didn’t know if it would be necessary for Congress to be involved, but that he would ask lawmakers to approve the change.“I don't know, but we're going to find out,” he said when asked if Congress would codify the renaming. “But I'm not sure they have to … There's a question as to whether or not they have to, but we'll put it before Congress.”Trump added that the cost of replacing signage and other materials associated with the department would be minimal.Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chair of the Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the department who has often clashed with Trump, including on defense spending, said on social media that the name change was not meaningful without greater financial investment. “If we call it the Dept. of War, we'd better equip the military to actually prevent and win wars,” the former Senate Republican leader wrote. “Can't preserve American primacy if we're unwilling to spend substantially more on our military than Carter or Biden. ‘Peace through strength’ requires investment, not just rebranding.”",,,,2025-09-05 18:57:24.019276

New Mexico is one of eight U.S. states that offer free meals to all public school students regardless of income. (Photo courtesy of the New Mexico Public Education Department)This school year, at least half of all meals served in public schools in New Mexico must be made from scratch using whole, fresh ingredients under a new state Public Education Department rule.
But an informal survey by the department suggests that most schools are not yet meeting the rule, according to an Aug. 6 report by the Legislative Finance Committee. Moving to scratch cooking often requires schools to completely overhaul their kitchens and hire enough staff to run them, the report states.
While New Mexico started offering free school meals to all public school students in fall 2023, those meals weren’t required to meet quality standards until the rule went into effect for this school year, LFC Program Evaluator Ryan Tolman told the interim Legislative Education Study Committee on Friday.
The state allocated $20 million in capital outlay funding for upgrading schools’ outdated kitchens in 2023, but only 14.6% of that money had been spent as of April, with only 10 of 87 projects completed, the report states.
Sen. Anthony Thornton (R-Sandia Park) asked Tolman why more projects haven’t been completed yet. Tolman said a large part of the problem is figuring out a district’s or school’s specific needs.
Meal service can come either from school-based kitchens; central or shared kitchens that deliver to multiple schools; or private food-service management contractors, Tolman said. The food itself can come from large suppliers, the USDA Foods program or local companies, he said.
If a school wasn’t originally built for scratch cooking, it can be difficult to retrofit it with new equipment because there may be a need for more space or other major renovations, Public Education Assistant Secretary Gregory Frostad told the committee.

More than half of Rio Rancho Public Schools’ 15,265 students participated in the universal free lunch program in the 2024 school year, according to legislative analysts.

The rule stems from New Mexico’s 2023 expansion of free, high-quality meals to all public K-12 and charter school students regardless of their families’ income. This year, New Mexico is one of eight states with universal school meal programs, along with California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota and Vermont, the LFC report states.
The department’s survey found that 57% of schools are expanding their training for scratch cooking in response to the new law, according to the report. However, schools tell LFC staff that keeping qualified kitchen staff is a major challenge, especially in rural areas, LFC Program Evaluator Josh Chaffin told the committee.
Staffing in school kitchens dropped as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a challenge, Laura Henry-Hand, deputy director of the department’s Student Success and Wellness Bureau, told the committee.
LFC recommends the department expand technical assistance and training in scratch cooking, food safety and compliance; and develop a statewide monitoring system to track spending, food waste, local food sourcing, scratch cooking, participation rates and students’ academic and health outcomes.
In the year since the law was passed, student participation in free breakfast has risen by 8.3% and free lunch by 8.5%, the report states, especially among students from higher-income families who wouldn’t have previously qualified. The report states there were increases in 68 out of the state’s 89 school districts, including all 10 of the largest ones.
Overall spending on school food programs in the state increased from $165 million in the 2018 school year to $248 million last year, the report states. Most of that comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) program.
Almost every New Mexico school that is eligible for CEP is participating this school year because the new law requires schools to use as much federal money as possible before using state funding, according to the report.
However, the federal government’s changes to the program’s eligibility criteria could shift more costs to New Mexico, with 20 schools losing their status under the program and 60 additional schools losing the full federal reimbursement.
With those federal changes, even if participation rates stay the same, the state is facing a 4% increase in costs totaling $2 million, Henry-Hand said.
The department is asking the Legislature for $42.2 million in recurring funding for the universal school meals program in Fiscal Year 2027, the same amount that lawmakers budgeted this year, Frostad said.
However, the department is asking for $5 million in one-time funding for potential cost overruns, he said. The LFC report notes that Michigan, Colorado and Minnesota each encountered substantial gaps between their projected and actual costs in their first years offering universal school meals.

Until Thursday, ""Wyoming’s Doctor"" had been silent on the CDC’s implosion. 
The post Barrasso joins GOP critics, Democrats in pressing RFK Jr. on vaccines appeared first on WyoFile .","Until Thursday, Wyoming U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a physician and the Senate’s second-ranking Republican, had been silent on the implosion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
When CDC Director Susan Monarez was fired last week — less than a month after President Donald Trump had appointed her to lead the agency — and several CDC leaders subsequently resigned in protest, Barrasso remained mum. 
Meanwhile, Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, also a physician and chair of the Senate’s health committee, quickly called for “oversight” of the  “high-profile departures.”
Then on Thursday, Barrasso joined the fray when the Senate’s Finance Committee grilled Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on his leadership and approach to vaccine policy. 
“Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines,” Barrasso said. 
“Since then, I’ve grown deeply concerned.”
The comment was notable, as Barrasso has, up until now, avoided criticizing Trump administration appointees and policies.
During a 24-year career as an orthopedic surgeon, Barrasso came to be known as “Wyoming’s Doctor,” often making guest appearances on one of Casper’s local TV news stations. And he’s offered his medical perspectives since becoming a senator, including advocating for use of COVID vaccines in 2020.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday, Monarez said Kennedy pressured her to resign or “face termination” after she refused to comply with “troubling directives” from Kennedy. That included rubber stamping recommendations of a “vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,” Monarez wrote.
After Kennedy built his reputation and fortune advocating against vaccines, he reassured lawmakers during his confirmation hearings that he would not limit access to vaccines. 
Barrasso backed him at the time. At Thursday’s hearing, Barrasso backed vaccines. 
“Over the last 50 years, vaccines are estimated to have saved 154 million lives worldwide,” Barrasso said. “I support vaccines. I’m a doctor. Vaccines work.”
Barrasso also said the National Institute of Health’s questioning of the use of mRNA vaccines, a national measles outbreak and the loss of leadership at the CDC is eroding public trust. 
“Americans don’t know who to rely on,” Barrasso said. 
He also noted that later this month the CDC’s revamped vaccine panel will meet to discuss childhood recommendations.
“Parents and physicians depend upon this guidance to make decisions and to keep kids safe,” Barrasso said, adding that he’s concerned “safe, proven vaccines, like measles, like Hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy, and that would put Americans at risk and reverse decades of progress.”
Barrasso’s newfound criticism of a Trump appointee did little to impress the Wyoming Democratic Party, which released a statement Friday calling on the congressman to “shove it.”
“John Barrasso is craven, but he’s not stupid,” the party said in a statement. “After all, he is a doctor. He knew exactly who and what he was voting to confirm — he just values his political career more than the lives of his constituents.”
The three-hour-long hearing often grew combative, even boiling over at times into a shouting match between Kennedy and Democratic lawmakers. 
Kennedy told New Hampshire Democrat Sen. Maggie Hassan she was “just making stuff up,” accused Monarez of being a liar, defended his tenure and showed no sign of slowing down on his makeover of the country’s top health agency. 
“We are the sickest country in the world. That’s why we have to fire people at CDC. They did not do their job. This was their job to keep us healthy,” Kennedy said. “And I need to fire some of those people to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
While pointed in their questions, GOP lawmakers stopped short of asking for Kennedy’s resignation. 
Following the hearing, Barrasso was asked by reporters twice if he supports Kennedy, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
“I support the president,” Barrasso responded.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Students across Minnesota walked out of classes Friday to demand greater gun control following the mass shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis that left two students dead and 21 other people injured.
The walkouts were part of a national demonstration coordinated by Students Demand Action, which formed after the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.
Rayah Tolles, a sophomore at Saint Paul Conservatory for Performing Arts, marched with dozens of her classmates to the Capitol for a rally calling for bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.
“Sometimes I don’t even want to go to school because I’m afraid of what might happen,” Tolles said.
At Great River School in St. Paul, more than a hundred students filed out of class and into the parking lot carrying signs reading “Protect kids not guns” and “The scariest thing in school should be my grades not guns.”
Bella Carls-Rehovsky, a senior at Great River, said fear drove her to organize the demonstration with her fellow students after learning about the Annunciation shooting.
“Because coming to school every day with the risk of a shooting hanging over our heads is detrimental to everything,” Carls-Rehovsky said.

Carls-Rehovsky said she’s been participating in demonstrations and lobbying efforts for gun control since she was 10 years old, when her cousin died by gunfire. Firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and teens in the United States.
The student walk-outs add to the pressure on Minnesota lawmakers from gun control supporters, city leaders and the parents of victims of the Annunciation shooting to strengthen the state’s gun laws.
Gov. Tim Walz said earlier this week that he will call lawmakers back to St. Paul for a special session to consider gun control legislation including bans on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. But the chances of such legislation passing seem dim in a closely divided Legislature.
Walz said he would release a package of policy proposals but has yet to do so.
House Republicans released a list of proposals on Thursday should there be a special session, but none involve guns. They include increased funding for school security and mental health treatment as well as reversing the state’s ban on youth conversion therapy, which aims to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
In 2023 and 2024, the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a red flag law, which allows judges to confiscate firearms from people deemed dangerous to themselves or others, and a universal background check requirement. The Legislature also banned bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic guns to fire more rapidly like machine guns, and increased penalties for straw purchasers, or people who buy guns for someone who is prohibited from owning them.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_0479-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Individuals can upload their state-issued ID or driver's license to an Apple Wallet (left) or Google Wallet (right). The state of Montana has taken the next step in allowing technologically savvy residents to simplify their wallets — not only can you pay with a single tap, you can also verify your identity. 
Montana’s Motor Vehicle Division announced on Aug. 19 it was beginning to roll out Montana Mobile IDs, allowing Montanans with iPhones, Android devices and Apple watches to securely carry a state-issued ID or driver’s license on the device. Just over a dozen other states have adopted mobile ID technology. 
Columbia Falls Rep. Braxton Mitchell, one of the legislature’s youngest representatives, sponsored House Bill 519 in 2023 to authorize the use of digital driver’s licenses for drivers, to begin Sept. 1, 2025. 
“As a Gen Z lawmaker, I sponsored this bill to give Montanans the option to add their driver’s license to their digital wallet. Digital IDs are extremely secure, encrypted, and harder to fake than a traditional plastic ID,” Mitchell said in a statement. “This is a commonsense step to modernize services by adding IDs to the same place where you can already store your credit cards, insurance cards, flight tickets, and concert tickets, making life more convenient for those who choose to use it.”
Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, speaks on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2025. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)
Mitchell further bolstered the program during the most recent session with legislation that allows businesses to use digital IDs to verify an individual’s age for restricted sales such as alcohol and tobacco, or in gambling establishments. The new law also clarified that businesses cannot store data from an ID, or sell or transfer it to a third party. 
Mitchell told the Daily Montanan in a phone interview that while it’s taken two years for the MVD to get the program up and running, the uptake has been quick, and he’s heard positive feedback from constituents. 
“The first couple of days, they told me they had about 500 people enrolled, and I know they’re into the thousands now, if not the tens of thousands,” Mitchell said on Thursday. “It seems like it’s been a pretty good response without much media outreach about it.”
Representatives from MVD did not respond to requests for comment on the rollout or how many Montanans had verified their digital ID. 
“We have spent the last three years modernizing MVD and improving operating efficiencies and customer service,” MVD Administrator Laurie Bakri said in a press release. “Now that we have overhauled the basics, we are excited to embark on an era of innovation, starting with Montana Mobile IDs and the Montana Mobile ID Verifier for Android and iOS mobile devices.”
 Supporting businesses, ensuring privacy



How to add a Montana mobile ID 

Open your digital wallet (Apple or Google) and Add a new ID. 
Follow the prompts, which include scanning the hard copy of your ID or license.
Montana MVD will only receive the information it needs to approve or deny the request. 
For information on how to add and use an ID in Apple Wallet, including more information about security and privacy, click here.
For information on how to add and use a mobile ID on an Android mobile device click here.



Using the digital ID allows Montanans to provide age verification to participating businesses without sharing additional information such as names or addresses. They can also be used for online verification. 
While the process is in place for any individual to add a mobile ID to their mobile wallets, the uptake on the business side might take more time before becoming widespread. 
The state also launched its own verification app as a tool for businesses to accept mobile IDs and verify an individual’s age as 18+ or 21+, but there isn’t a requirement for businesses to utilize it. 
“The division has guided the alcohol and cannabis industries through our website, in-person meetings over the past few months, and direct push notifications to those who have signed up to receive updates from the department,” Cannabis & Alcohol Regulation Division Administrator Kristan Barbour told the Daily Montanan. 
Barbour said in the first few days of the roll out, the division had not received any feedback from businesses about the program. 
Establishments that sell age-restricted items, such as alcohol, can use the Montana Mobile ID Verifier app, or other approved electronic readers, but the decision to accept mobile IDs is on a business-by-business basis, so Montanans might not be able to use them at their local brewery or grocery store yet. 
The Montana Gambling Control Division also endorsed the state’s companion verification app for any gambling establishments.
“It’s secure and easy to use, which will make it a great addition to the services establishments already offer their customers,” Gambling Control Division Administrator Alex Sterhan said in a press release.
The Motor Vehicle Division said that Montanans should still carry a hard-copy of their ID or driver’s license with them for verification purposes, as adoption of the technology continues growing. 
The Montana Highway Patrol anticipates having the ability to verify mobile IDs before the end of the year, according to a press release, but representatives with MHP did not respond to questions from the Daily Montanan about a timeline for adoption. 
Mitchell said he and other colleagues in the Legislature who focus on digital privacy have continued to look at how to ensure Montanan’s are secure when using this new technology. 
One additional bill passed in 2025, Senate Bill 124, sponsored by Sen. Ken Bogner, R-Miles City, clarifies that if an individual hands a law enforcement officer their phone as their identification, that does not mean they consent to having their device searched. 
Bogner said in a press statement that digital IDs are a great tool for individuals worried about losing their physical ID. 
“If you are worried about losing your license or having it stolen and winding up in the wrong hands, this is for you,” Bogner said. “This gives Montanans the option to securely carry their encrypted ID on their devices, protecting personal information and limiting data exposure through lost or stolen physical credentials.”
 Montana to ‘set the tone for other states’

As mobile IDs become more widespread nationwide, the federal government is also transitioning various agencies to be able to utilize the technology. 
The TSA has announced it accepts digital IDs issued from 16 states and Puerto Rico, including Montana Mobile IDs in a Google or Apple wallet.
In Montana, mobile IDs can be used at the state’s largest airports — Billings, Bozeman, Glacier Park, Great Falls, Helena, and Missoula — but TSA states all passengers should also carry an acceptable physical ID.
Mitchell told the Daily Montanan that over the last week, he’s heard from businesses and individuals across the state curious how the program will work, but that “the vast majority is very excited about it.”
“You can’t fake this ID. You can’t use a screen shot. It’s a live, encoded verification process,” Mitchell said, pointing out that it could be particularly beneficial in college towns to verify the ages of younger adults. 
He added that he expects Montana to continue to be a leader on modernizing its code and integrating new technology. 
“We’re one of the first states to do the whole process of rolling this out,” Mitchell said. “I think we’re definitely going to set the tone for other states to follow.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-12.17.44 PM-1024x488.png,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Burlington’s police union and the mayor signed a three-year contract this week expected to help address longstanding hiring and retention issues and make the city’s police department a more attractive place to work.
“I think we secured some benefits that are incredibly important, both for recruitment and retention,” said Joseph Corrow, president of the Burlington Police Officers’ Association.
The 76-page contract signed Wednesday increases the base salary over a 15-step salary scale that ranges from $88,400 to $114,979. It adds retention bonuses after 5, 10, 15 and 20 years of service and stipends for full time police officers who are on call.
It also increases benefits like life insurance, pensionable overtime, and allows up to eight years of pension buy-in for lateral hires.
These are big wins, Corrow said, because it will allow certified officers from other police departments to transfer more easily to Burlington, allow a portion of their overtime pay to go toward their pensions, and be able to buy back years in the pension system instead of having to start from scratch. For lateral hires, officers would be able to come into the department at the stepped salary depending on their years of experience.
Union members called it a strong contract that will help rebuild morale and staffing in the department, Corrow said.
“I am encouraged by the agreement, as it signals strong support for policing in Burlington and provides the salary and benefits package necessary to retain and recruit the best,” Interim Chief of Police Shawn Burke said in an emailed statement.
The department currently has 61 officers and eight vacancies, he said.
Policing Burlington is “both complex and demanding,” said Burke, who stepped in to fill the post vacated by Jon Murad in March. Murad led the department for five years and recently became the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections.
An internal anonymous survey of rank-and-file officers conducted by the police union last summer showed a department struggling with both recruitment and retention issues, with 75% of officers surveyed calling morale “poor” or “terrible.”
This contract aims to fix some of those issues and positions Burlington as one of the most competitive police departments statewide, Corrow said. 
“It makes us stand out at the top,” he said.
The contract comes a week after the City Council passed measures pertaining to City Hall Park amid continued debate about public safety enforcement downtown. 
Contract negotiations ended in July and the terms were agreed upon and unanimously approved last month by the Burlington City Council.
The mayor and members of the council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gavin Newsom sued the Southern California city. A Los Angeles judge must approve the settlement.,"In summary
Norwalk backed down from its ban on homeless shelters after Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Southern California city. A Los Angeles judge must approve the settlement.


In a win for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, a newly inked courtroom deal would force the Southern California city of Norwalk to reverse its citywide ban on homeless shelters.
The legal settlement marks the end of a year-long battle between the governor and the city in Los Angeles County. If a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court approves the deal, Norwalk also will have to put $250,000 toward the development of new affordable housing in the city.
The fight started when Norwalk approved a ban on emergency shelters, supportive housing and several businesses that predominantly serve low-income residents, such asg liquor stores, discount stores, laundromats and payday loan establishments. In response, Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the city in November. 
Newsom today called the city’s refusal to support housing for its homeless residents “inexcusable.”
“No community should turn its back on its residents in need – especially while there are people in your community sleeping on the streets,” he said in a statement. “No city is exempt from doing their part to solve the homelessness crisis.”
A spokesperson for Norwalk did not provide a comment on the lawsuit by CalMatters’ deadline. 
In a memo to council members last year, city staff wrote that shelters and homeless housing could have “detrimental effects” on the community, potentially causing “over proliferation,” noise and economic impacts, and harming property maintenance and security. Then-Mayor Margarita Rios previously told CalMatters the city passed the moratorium after frustrations mounted over a state-funded Project Roomkey hotel that housed homeless residents during the pandemic. 
The ban also blocked Los Angeles County’s plans to turn a hotel in Norwalk into homeless housing.
Newsom’s administration has made a recent effort to ramp up enforcement against cities it says are not doing their share to combat the state’s affordable housing crisis. Last year, the administration settled a lawsuit against Elk Grove in Sacramento County over the city’s denial of a housing project and got a court order forcing Huntington Beach in Orange County to follow state housing law. Newsom launched a Housing Accountability Unit in 2021 to hold cities to goals mandated in state housing plans.
“If any city or county wants to test our resolve, today’s settlement is your answer,” Bonta said in a statement about the Norwalk case. “All of us have a legal and moral responsibility to help — not hurt — those struggling to keep a roof over their heads or lacking housing altogether.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in Kansas' congressional delegation, objects to altering boundaries so GOP is more likely to beat her in 2026.","U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas shown here in Abilene in 2023, is opposed to the Kansas Legislature complying with President Donald Trump's request to redraw the state's four U.S. House districts to make it easier for a Republican candidate to win her seat in Congress in the 2026 election. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids objected Friday to being targeted by Republicans eager to adopt a new congressional map for Kansas that divided Johnson County and further gerrymandered the state’s four districts.
A special session of the Kansas Legislature to consider changes advocated by President Donald Trump could follow the playbook used in Texas and Missouri. In both states, the GOP has moved to undermine Democratic strongholds to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House. In response, California and other states have expressed interest in altering district boundaries to favor Democrats.
“Politicians are once again focused on political games to benefit themselves and their extreme agenda, not hardworking Kansans,” Davids said. “Voters should pick their representatives, not the other way around, and this unprecedented step would only further polarize this country and harm our democracy.”
Davids was elected to the 3rd District seat in 2018 and earned reelection three times. Ahead of the 2022 election, the Legislature removed the northern half of Wyandotte County from her district and added a cluster of rural counties to improve the odds for Republican candidates. For the second time, Davids defeated GOP nominee Amanda Adkins while increasing her margin of victory over the 2020 result.
“I ran for Congress to serve the people of Kansas, and if this moves forward, every option will remain on the table to make sure Kansans’ voices are heard,” Davids said.
Trump urged states to manipulate congressional boundaries ahead of the 2026 midterm in an attempt to pad the thin GOP majority in the U.S. House.
In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill designed to create five additional right-leaning districts at the expense of Democrats. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is spearheading a plan to place five GOP districts in hands of Democrats. A map under review by Missouri lawmakers would shift a Kansas City area district to the right.
A comparable effort by legislative leaders in Kansas to weaken Davids’ prospects of winning in 2026 would likely involve undercutting the electoral influence of Johnson County voters. Splitting the county between two congressional districts and blending those areas with large contingents of Republicans would make it more difficult for Davids to prevail.
Johnson County has recently favored Democrats, including Davids and Gov. Laura Kelly. In 2022, Kelly won reelection with 49.5% of the statewide vote, but benefitted from a 59% margin in Johnson County. Secretary of state candidate Jeanna Repass and attorney general candidate Chris Mann, both Democrats, carried Johnson County in 2022, but lost those races when the statewide vote was tallied.
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said gerrymandering had been a reality in politics throughout his life.
“Most of the blue states are gerrymandered to the point that … I don’t know what else they could do to change the ratio,” he said. “The Democrats have always led in this gerrymandering.”
 
The GOP quest in ’26
Former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor in 2026, said the Legislature ought to promptly redraw congressional boundaries to favor Republicans. It would demonstrate the state’s political support for Trump, he said.
“National Democrats have gerrymandered Congress to make it more liberal than the real America,” Colyer said. “Kansas needs to lead the way in restoring sanity to our federal government.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who is among more than a half dozen GOP candidates for governor, said a special session devoted to redistricting the state’s congressional districts was under discussion.

“I am actively engaged in the battle for the heart and soul of America, helping the president to Make America Great Again,” he said.
Three years ago, there was an effort by Masterson and other legislators to hold Johnson County together as a community of interest as Kansas last overhauled congressional maps based on 2020 Census data.
He said the obligation was to divide the state’s population into four equal quadrants. That was done, he said, ahead of the 2022 election in a way that maintained Johnson County as the core of the 3rd District.
“We don’t draw the maps on voters,” Masterson said at that time. “We draw the map on residents.”
Masterson also issued a statement that said the Legislature’s mapping resulted in “compact and contiguous districts,” and it “preserves existing district cores and groups together communities of interest.”
In 2022, Kelly vetoed the congressional map adopted by the Legislature because she disagreed with moving half of Wyandotte County out of Davids’ district. The Legislature voted to override her. Lawsuits were filed to prevent implementation of the new congressional map as plaintiffs argued racial gerrymandering was illegal.
A district court judge agreed with the plaintiffs, but the Kansas Supreme Court reversed the lower court and affirmed the constitutionality of the new congressional map.




 ‘Pandering to extremists’

House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, said interest among Republican candidates for governor to subvert the will of Kansas voters through redistricting was about landing Trump’s endorsement.
“The push for congressional redistricting is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to gain Trump’s favor and advance personal political ambitions,” Woodard said. “With so many Republican candidates now vying for governor, it’s clear that the race has become a contest to win Donald Trump’s endorsement.”
He said supporters of redistricting in Kansas were “pandering to extremists in Washington, D.C.”
In Kansas, Republicans hold supermajorities over Democrats in the House and Senate. Redrawn maps targeting Davids would likely be vetoed by Kelly. The question would be whether GOP leadership in the House and Senate could control their partisan advantage to deliver two-thirds majorities to override the governor again.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes of Lenexa said Kansas traditionally reapportioned state and federal districts on a 10-year cycle. She said it was wrong to diverge from that principled process.
“When those in power, regardless of which side of the aisle they are on, use their position of power to silence others and only increase their own power, we all lose,” Sykes said.
Sykes said GOP changes to Kansas’ congressional map could mean the votes of thousands of people no longer had an influence on the outcome of U.S. House races.
“There is no wonder why so many Americans have lost faith in their government,” she said. “They lose faith when politicians use the power of an office to take power away from where it belongs — in the hands of the people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sharice-Davids-in-abilene-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Memorial Blood Centers reported a 44% increase in blood donations in the week following the Aug. 27 mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church which left two children dead and 21 others injured.
Memorial Blood Centers, which services several local hospitals, provided over 250 units of blood platelets and plasma to Children’s Minnesota, M Health Fairview, Hennepin Healthcare, and North Memorial Health for treating victims from the Annunciation shooting and other shootings last week, according to spokesperson Corey Bianchi-Rossi.
Blood donations at this point may not go to the victims directly, but a constant supply of donations helps prepare for any future tragedies, as well as provide for the routine need for blood transfusions in surgeries or illnesses, the spokesperson said.
“The reason we were able to supply the hospitals that needed the blood to help their patients, the victims, is because of the people who donated the week prior,” Bianchi-Rossi said.
Before the Annunciation shooting, blood donation organizations had declared a “blood emergency”, when the state’s blood supply dropped to below a two-day inventory — far below the ideal seven-day inventory. A lower supply of blood is to be expected in the summer months, when accidents increase and regular donors might be traveling. As of Tuesday, the blood supply is back up to a four-day inventory, Bianchi-Rossi said, and will likely trend upward in the coming days.
Memorial Blood Centers has seen more than a 400% increase in appointments made since the shooting. Last week, that resulted in an additional 931 transfusable units over the average weekly donation of 2100 units. On Wednesday, spots were nearly filled at a blood drive held at Annunciation Church, which normally hosts a blood drive four times a year.
A larger than usual portion of the donations came from first-timer donors. Typically during this time of year, only 11% of donations are made by first-time donors, compared to 24% since the day of the Annunciation shooting.
The American Red Cross, which also has local blood donation centers, was not asked by the city or hospitals to provide blood in response to the shootings, said spokesperson Nate Russell.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250903_0068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Free.,"Federal judge blocks Noem from ending temporary  protections for Venezuelans, Haitians",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-noem-ending-temporary-protections-venezuelans-haitians,,"WASHINGTON — A San Francisco federal court Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary protections for hundreds of thousands of nationals from Venezuela and Haiti.The decision from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California comes as the Department of Homeland Security Friday filed a notice ending Temporary Protected Status by Nov. 7 for a group of 250,000 Venezuelans who were granted deportation protections in 2021 by President Donald Trump. Chen found that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to undo extended protections for Venezuelans was baseless and preordained for the “purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS.”“DHS began drafting the decision to vacate within days after President Trump began his second administration,” Chen said. “There is no indication that the Secretary or DHS consulted any other government agencies or conducted an internal evaluation as part of this process.” Chen said Noem’s decision to end TPS for Haiti “was not materially different from that carried out for Venezuela.” DHS to appealIn a statement to States Newsroom, a DHS spokesperson said the agency will appeal the decision.""While this order delays justice, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,” the spokesperson said.Former President Joe Biden granted TPS holders from Venezuela protections until October 2026 and protections until February 2026 for holders from Haiti. In Friday’s decision, the judge said decisions on TPS have been carefully considered in the past. “For 35 years, the TPS statute has been faithfully executed by presidential administrations from both parties, affording relief based on the best available information obtained by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) in consultation with the State Department and other agencies, a process that involves careful study and analysis. Until now,” Chen said. TPS is granted when a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to, for reasons such as violence, political instability or extreme natural disasters. The Trump administration has moved to end that status, which protects immigrants from deportation and grants work permits, as it aims to limit legal pathways in its immigration crackdown. Trump tried to end TPS for Haiti during his first term, but was blocked by the courts.“This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,” said Chen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.900,000 people with legal protectionsMore than 600,000 Venezuelans have TPS after arriving in the United States in 2021 and 2023. More than 300,000 Haitians have TPS, which was granted after a catastrophic earthquake in 2010.Chen said that while the Supreme Court in May allowed the Trump administration to continue with removing protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, he argued the justices did not make a decision on the merits of the case.“The Supreme Court’s order did not bar this Court from adjudicating the case on the merits and entering a final judgement issuing relief under… the (Administrative Procedure Act),” Chen wrote. An appeals court last week ruled in a separate but related case regarding TPS for Venezuelans that deemed the Trump administration likely acted unlawfully in ending the protected status for those immigrants.",,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Leaders of Vermont’s House Appropriations Committee have warned colleagues that next year’s state budget-building process could be among the most difficult in recent memory — potentially forcing some existing programs onto the chopping block — as lawmakers grapple with sweeping federal funding cuts in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law.
“We expect the upcoming state budget cycle to present a number of challenges that most of us have not experienced as legislators before due to uncertainty in the economic forecast and changes in the federal budget,” wrote Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, and Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, in a memo to the full House last month. Scheu is the committee’s chair; Harrison is its vice chair.
Moreover, the leaders of the powerful budget-writing panel wrote, “We may need to ask policy committees to review existing programs to see if there are any that can be scaled back or may no longer be the priority they once were.”
The House’s “policy committees” focus on specific areas of law, such as education, health care or transportation. The Appropriations Committee, which oversees state spending, and the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax policy, are known as the chamber’s two “money committees.”
The memo, which was shared with VTDigger, was part of an email House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, sent to all 150 House members on Aug. 11. Krowinski’s email included a handful of other summertime updates for her colleagues, who adjourned their 2025 session in mid-June and are slated to come back to the Statehouse for the 2026 session in January. 
Harrison described the intent of his and Scheu’s message during a panel of top Vermont Republican leaders Thursday night in Ludlow. 
“One, the message was, don’t think of new ways to spend the money, even though there are a lot of them,” he said. “And two, we need you to start thinking about, what are the programs that we have that may have been a good idea and served a good purpose 20 years ago, but maybe aren’t as important today as something else — like health care.”
Citing projections economists shared with legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Scott in late July, Scheu and Harrison wrote that state revenues are expected to increase by about $61 million during the state’s 2027 fiscal year. That’s the time period, running from July 2026 to June 2027, for which lawmakers will be creating a new state budget starting in January. 
While that revenue upgrade is good news, Scheu and Harrison wrote, it won’t be enough to cover projected increases in salaries and benefits for state employees and “a myriad of other fixed costs,” they wrote, meaning “we can probably expect some adjustments to programs and services” to make up the difference. 
The economists also cautioned that their projections could need to be revisited because of uncertainty over the impacts of both the GOP-led federal spending package and Trump’s tariffs. 
“Don’t get comfortable,” Tom Kavet, one of the state’s economists, said in July. 
It’s unlikely, however, that the full Legislature will need to meet again this year to respond to losses in federal funding, Scheu and Harrison wrote. That’s because many of the changes included in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” do not take effect until 2026, or later, the legislators said. That includes certain cuts to Medicaid and access to federal nutritional assistance, among others. 
Lawmakers added several measures into the state budget bill for the current fiscal year, which they approved in May, that would trigger a special legislative session if federal funding cuts reached certain thresholds. But those thresholds are unlikely to be hit just yet, according to Scheu and Harrison.
Before legislators start work on the state budget next year, they will first get a proposed spending plan from the Scott administration. In an email Friday, Scott’s press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said the administration was still too early in its budget development process to say whether any existing state programs might see significant cuts.
“We’ll review all funding impacts and deliver a balanced budget to the Legislature in January,” she said.

Youngblut’s appearance Friday afternoon was the first court hearing since prosecutors filed upgraded charges last month against the former Seattle resident, which carry the possibility of the death penalty.

BURLINGTON — Teresa Youngblut pleaded not guilty Friday to federal criminal charges that could carry the death penalty in the fatal shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont. 
The hearing in federal court in Burlington was the first since prosecutors obtained an indictment with upgraded charges last month and filed notice that they will seek Youngblut’s execution, if convicted, of the capital crimes.  
Youngblut, a 21-year-old former Seattle resident, had initially been charged earlier this year with federal firearms and assault charges in connection with a traffic stop that led to the fatal shooting of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland on Interstate 91 in Coventry on the afternoon of Jan. 20. 
The latest indictment charges Youngblut with murdering Maland’s and assaulting two other agents with a deadly weapon. 
Youngblut remains held without bail following Friday’s hearing.
Prosecutors alleged in charging documents that after the traffic stop on I-91, Youngblut exited the Toyota Prius that had been pulled over and opened fire, resulting in a shootout with law enforcement. 
Maland, 44, of Newport, was killed in the exchange of gunfire, court documents stated, as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national and a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving.
Youngblut and Bauckholt had been linked to a loosely connected group of people known as the Zizians, whose members have been tied to at least six other homicides across the country, including a landlord in California and a couple in Pennsylvania.  
Federal capital charges were being considered by prosecutors in Youngblut’s case for some time, with U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi signaling shortly after taking office in February that she would be pushing for the charges as well.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his inauguration day Jan. 20 — the same day as Maland’s fatal shooting — lifting a moratorium on the federal death penalty that had been put in place during the Biden administration.
Bondi, in a later directive to federal prosecutors across the country, specifically cited Maland’s death as a case where capital charges would be warranted.
Vermont has not carried out an execution since 1954 and the state no longer has the death penalty, but Youngblut was charged in federal court, where capital punishment remains an option.

Hunger Mountain Co-op in Montpelier has purchased the neighboring property of rK Miles, a lumberyard that was damaged in a 2023 fire, as part of an expansion plan.  
The co-op purchased the 1.6-acre property for $487,500, according to a press release. Co-op leaders plan to use the lot to expand its capacity for parking, storage and other operational needs. 
“This purchase is a key part of our long-term vision to deepen the Co-op’s values of health, sustainability, and cooperation,” general manager Mary Mullally said in the press release. “Back in 2012, we anticipated a need for more parking and retail space. This agreement allows us to explore those options while continuing to serve our vibrant community.” 
The co-op sits along Stone Cutters Way, a one-way street parallel to the Winooski River. Its customer parking lot is located on the northwest side of the building, while the new purchase adjoins the co-op building to the southeast. 
The exterior of an 8,000-square foot building on the former rK Miles property still has fire damage that will need to be addressed before it can be used for storage, Mullally said in a phone interview. The property will allow the co-op to buy in larger quantities, and it should also be “relatively easy” to set up staff parking on the site as an initial goal, she said. 
But the press release and website for the project seem to anticipate concerns from members. In its “frequently asked questions” section, the co-op addressed the timing of the purchase with the recent ratification of a union contract with UE 255, the union that represents co-op employees. 
According to the website, the timing was a coincidence, and the purchase should not affect salaries because money used for the purchase is from reserve funds rather than the operating budget. The union did not respond to a request for comment before publication time. 
The FAQs also addressed why the purchase negotiation was not shared with members. It was instead left to a smaller council vote. 
“We began exploring the possibility seriously in the fall of 2024, after the property’s owner expressed interest in selling,” the co-op wrote on the website. “At that point, we followed standard fiduciary and governance practices by conducting due diligence in private. This included reviewing financial terms, legal considerations, environmental assessments, and potential risks.”
Mullally said the co-op published the FAQ section to “provide as much information as possible.” So far, the feedback received has been “extremely positive,” she said. 
The co-op has its annual meeting planned for Sept. 13. Members are welcome to bring their questions about the future of the property to the meeting, Mullally said. 
In the long term, the co-op has floated ideas for the property: Expanded retail space, community gardens, housing. But the co-op may need further assessments to determine if environmental remediation is needed, it wrote on the website. The co-op is also creating a flood risk management plan. 
Mullally said it has been “a long process,” but she’s happy it’s come to completion. 
“I’m so excited about what this means to the co-op’s future,” she said.

Advocates want CT to do the same.","Connected elected officials and disability rights organizations this week called on Gov. Ned Lamont to take action on the state’s vaccine eligibility guidelines amid uncertainty over federal vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership.
Over the past week, some states have made early moves to take control of vaccine guidance.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey this week directed the state Department of Public Health to authorize pharmacists to administer the new COVID vaccine to anyone 5 years of age or older, despite recent changes to eligibility from the FDA. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Friday issued a similar directive. 
In late August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved new COVID-19 vaccines for the fall, but only for people 65 and older and those who are at high-risk for severe disease. Previously, the vaccines were available to anyone 6 months or older. The move was significant because federal vaccine guidelines determine both the availability of vaccines and coverage by insurers.
Attorneys with Disability Rights CT and the CT Council on Developmental Disabilities sent a letter to Lamont on Friday requesting that he issue state guidance with broader eligibility standards. 
“We urge you to follow the lead of Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and adopt and publicize a broader standard eliminating the need to prove such a condition and requiring all insurance plans to continue to cover vaccinations outside of the [Centers for Disease Control] guidelines,” the attorneys stated in the letter. They also noted that the Association of Massachusetts Health Plans had agreed to continue providing coverage for the shots.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Lamont, said the state “will be preparing what we must to ensure no one’s health is jeopardized in Connecticut.” However, the statement did not address the request from the disabilities rights organizations or the current availability of vaccines for those younger than 65 without underlying health conditions. 
As of Friday morning, the availability of vaccines in Connecticut was still in flux. 
Western state governors are working regionally to issue public health guidance. On Wednesday, a handful of governors announced the creation of the West Coast Health Alliance “to uphold scientific integrity in public health as Trump destroys CDC’s credibility,” according to a statement from Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. Oregon, Washington and Hawaii are also part of the coalition.
In a statement issued the following day, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and Senate President Pro Tempore Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, called on northeastern states to follow suit, while acknowledging that some level of coordination is already happening. 
“The West Coast Health Alliance also comes amid reports that Connecticut was one of eight states to send public health officials to a recent meeting about forming their own regional alliance. Such an effort would allow states to make health recommendations and guidance directly to the public. Sens. Looney and Duff encouraged Connecticut officials to pursue these partnerships,” the statement read.
Brittany Schaefer, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Public Health, confirmed that Commissioner Manisha Juthani and other staff attended a regional meeting of public health officials last month that allowed the states to share strategies “at a time of federal health restructuring and cuts.”
“CT has regularly collaborated with neighboring states as public health challenges extend beyond state lines and those conversations have ramped up in recent months following recent federal health changes,” Schaefer said when asked about the statement from Senators Duff and Looney.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25247536418606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The four detainees who escaped an immigrant jail in Newark earlier this summer have been caught and now face up to a year imprisonment and $100,000 fines each, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for New Jersey announced Friday.
The last of the escapees, Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon, 25, of Colombia, appeared in federal court on Aug. 18, the office announced.
Mogollon, along with Franklin Norberto Bautista Reyes, 20, of Honduras; Joan Sebastian Castaneda Lozada, 18, of Colombia; and Joel Enrrique Sandoval-Lopez, 22, of Honduras, escaped Delaney Hall in Newark on June 12 by busting through a second-story aluminum wall, dropping mattresses through the opening to soften their landing, and hurdling jail fences by using bed sheets to cover the barbed wire.
The four were apprehended within a week of their escape — Mogollon in Los Angeles on July 17, and the other three in New Jersey on June 15 and 16, according to the office.
The 1,100-bed immigrant jail — the first to open under President Donald Trump’s second term — is owned and operated by the private prison company Geo Group under a 15-year contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
It has drawn protests since it opened in May, with New Jersey’s two senators saying the escape proved the facility is in “shoddy” shape and should be evacuated.
It was also the site of a May 9 scuffle between visiting politicians and jail security that fueled complaints that acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is using her position to attack political foes. During that fracas, officers arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Habba later secured an indictment of Rep. LaMonica McIver, after accusing her of assaulting officers outside the jail. Baraka and McIver are Democrats.
Baraka’s charges were quickly dropped, while McIver’s case remains ongoing.

SPRINGFIELD — The 36-year-old man who was shot to death by police last month appears to have gotten caught up in an operation that was targeting another man for arrest, according to people who were at the address when the shooting occurred.
Police claim that, on the evening of Aug. 21, James Crary was in a vehicle when he allegedly “accelerated toward officers” who were “outside their vehicles” during a police response at 78 Valley St. Officers then opened fire, striking Crary multiple times. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Vermont State Police said in a press release.
The circumstances of Crary’s death are now under investigation by the Vermont State Police, which was not involved in the “underlying operation” that led to the shooting. The two police officers who fired their weapons — Springfield police officer Vincent Franchi and Windsor County Sheriff’s deputy Bryan Jalava — have been placed on paid leave and are cooperating with the investigation, according to police.
In interviews, people who said they were present at the time of the shooting described the aftermath.
“The police said, ‘We weren’t even here for James Crary,’” said Khristal Blanchard, a resident at 78 Valley St., who witnessed part of the incident.
According to Blanchard, police told her they had come to apprehend a suspect in a “hostage and kidnapping situation” earlier that day in Springfield.
Springfield police and Windsor sheriff deputies — officials have not disclosed how many — responded to the Valley Street address shortly before 9:30 p.m. on Aug. 21 “as part of an open investigation,” Vermont State Police said in the release. When they arrived, “they encountered a man” — later identified as Crary — “in a vehicle outside the home.”
Police then opened fire at Crary. The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington conducted an autopsy and concluded Crary died from “gunshot wounds to the head,” according to Vermont State Police.
Investigators are reviewing cruiser and body cam video footage of the incident, including “third party” video of the incident, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman.
Springfield Police Chief Jeffrey Burnham referred questions about the police operation and shooting to state police.

Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer said his department’s deputies were at 78 Valley St. that evening to “help Springfield arrest a suspect on a pretty serious charge.” 
Following the shooting, police apprehended the suspect, who was inside the house, and charged him with assaulting and robbing $300 from a Springfield man whom police say held against his will at a nearby apartment, according to court documents. 
‘I didn’t even know the cops were here’
Crary most recently had been living in Newport, New Hampshire, and authorities have not said why he was in Springfield the night of the shooting. People who were at the address that evening said Crary had come to check up on a female friend who was there.
“It was a pop-in visit,” said Randi Sargent, who was among a group watching a movie in the garage space when Crary had appeared at the door.
He stayed for a little while and “had just said goodbye and left,” Sargent said. Shortly afterward she heard four gunshots.
“I thought it was someone shooting at the house,” she said.
Blanchard said she briefly chatted with Crary in the driveway and then went back up to her room on the second floor of the house.
“I didn’t even know the cops were here,” Blanchard said.
When she got to her room, she heard gunshots and looked outside the window over the driveway.
“I saw James’ head go down and hit the steering wheel,” Blanchard said. “The car started to roll back and was smoking.”
She said she started to scream, and two people with her in the room pulled her away from the window.
Both Sargent and Blanchard said they heard a total of four shots.

Sargent pointed out bullet holes in the wall of the converted garage used as a lounge space that she said came from the police gunfire.
Several people were sitting on the sofa watching the movie when bullets pierced the wall, which barely missed her boyfriend sitting at the end, Sargent said. When they heard the shots, one in the group shut the door to the room.
“We laid on the floor over here and we barricaded the door until (the police) told us to open it,” Sargent said.
Blanchard said after the shooting she heard police yelling to “come down with your hands up” and the people upstairs — including the intended suspect — all came down.
Blanchard said she remonstrated the officers over the shooting: “What was this all about? Like, are you serious? Was this really called for?”
Blanchard said one of the officers responded: “This was not what we meant to happen. We’re so sorry for your loss. We weren’t here for (Crary).” 
Crary’s body lay covered in the driveway for more than 12 hours before it was taken to the medical examiner’s office in Burlington, according to people at the house.
Shooting victim leaves behind a daughter
Kristin Crary said her brother grew up alternating between his mother’s in Claremont and at their father’s in Canaan. He attended Mascoma Valley High School and often had jobs waxing and stripping floors.
Julie Morse, who knew Crary when they grew up together in Claremont and had been his friend for 20 years, said he “would never purposefully been out to hurt anybody ever.”
Morse said Crary liked buffing the floors of Hannaford and Market Basket on the overnight shift because “he could be left alone independently.”
Crary left behind a 10-year-old daughter who “meant a lot to him,” Morse said.
The day after the shooting occurred, Morse went to 78 Valley St. to talk with neighbors and people there about how events had unfolded. She said she suspects that Crary was trying to pull out of the driveway when he became “startled” by the large police contingent that had come to arrest Hewitt.
“James was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” she said.

The organization’s annual free dental clinic opens at 6 a.m., but people will line up early, waiting to receive cleanings, procedures and other services the volunteer clinicians and aids can provide.
This year, University of Iowa dental faculty and students will join Iowa Mission of Mercy (IMOM) volunteers to provide free dental care to anyone in need during the two-day clinic, which is coming to Coralville for the first time.
Brendan Young, a University of Iowa associate professor of dentistry and director of behavioral science who has volunteered with IMOM for four years, said he met one woman who said she relies on the annual clinic, which stops in a different area of Iowa each year, for all of her oral health care.
“I think the lines sort of indicate there is a real need, and people are really grateful for the opportunity to get that need met,” Young said. “And so, coming in, they’re in a pretty good mood, and certainly when they leave, there’s a great deal of relief and a great deal of gratitude.”

The 100-bed clinic will open at 6 a.m. on Sept. 19 and 20 at Hyatt Regency Coralville Hotel and Conference Center, according to a news release from Iowa Mission of Mercy, and will remain open each day until the clinic reaches capacity.
IMOM has been operating the free clinic since 2008, according to its website, and has served more than 18,000 patients. UI Clinical Associate Professor of Oral Pathology, Radiology, and Medicine Carrie McKnight said she’s volunteered with IMOM for nearly 10 years, and each clinic provides approximately $1 million in services for patients.
In Coralville, however, McKnight said she expects to surpass that number.
Anyone, regardless of their age, insurance, income or where they call home, is welcome to come by the clinic for oral health care, including cleaning, fillings, root canals, exams and more, McKnight said. Participants will also receive information and materials to address dental needs at home.
When it comes to dental care, Young said people can experience a variety of barriers to getting their needs met. A primary block is the cost of care, he said, but fear and shame can keep folks from visiting a dentist consistently, or at all. People often are afraid of pain, of needing their teeth pulled and of having visible dental issues like missing teeth or bleeding gums which are stigmatized in the U.S.
Young said oral health can even impact someone’s relationships, employability and other areas of life.

“People feel really self conscious about their teeth, and going to see a dentist when you’ve got poor oral health — it can really serve as a barrier,” Young said. “And so we make a real effort at IMOM to be super nonjudgmental. Come as you are — we will meet you where you are.”
Young said a lot of work goes into organizing the clinics, from finding the right space, to setting up equipment and ensuring the infrastructure is there to support it. In addition to dental clinicians and students volunteering to help run the event, he said other volunteers help with things like onsite child care and more. Local plumbers will even donate their time to install temporary water lines and ensure they run properly.
McKnight said a “contingent” of dental students are always on board to work the clinic, but this year there was an outpouring of support from students, faculty and community dentists. UI dental students get to work with real patients at the university during their education as well, she said, and showing them their ability to help those in need is a “key component” of their education.
While a more dour mood might be expected at a dental clinic, Young said participants are generally happy to have the resource available and grateful to receive expert care.
McKnight said the clinic can’t solve all of the problems some patients have, and staff often have to cut off the line when they reach capacity, but Young said many people leave the clinic in less pain than when they came in.
“There is a lot of gratitude for what we do,” McKnight said. “So it certainly fills our cup to be able to help them.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Well before he canceled and skipped meetings with the state’s top school board in recent weeks, state Superintendent Ryan Walters has been chronically absent from multiple state boards where he holds a seat, including one he’s supposed to lead.
Public meeting records show poor attendance from Walters, particularly this year, on various governing boards whose votes impact K-12 school funding, vocational learning centers, higher education and other state government matters.
This year, Walters has attended only one meeting of the state Board of Career and Technology Education despite being its chair, Oklahoma Voice found through an analysis of meeting minutes. He skipped the CareerTech board’s six other meetings in 2025, including three that took place in a room adjacent to his office at the Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
Oklahoma CareerTech Director Brent Haken, a non-voting member of the board, has led the meetings in Walters’ place. In 2024, Walters attended six meetings and missed four, and in 2023, he attended seven and was absent for four, meeting minutes show.
Haken said Walters’ presence, or lack thereof, has had no impact on the board and the CareerTech agency, which oversee vocational education centers across the state.
“Actually I enjoy the lack of attention so that we can get work done for the state of Oklahoma,” he said.

Walters also leads the Oklahoma State Board of Education, whose meetings have become a circus of protests, political conflict and media attention during his tenure in office.
After a month of heightened tensions with board members, Walters abruptly canceled the board’s regular Aug. 28 meeting with little explanation. It was the board’s second canceled meeting of 2025, the first happening after the Education Department posted an agenda too late to comply with the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act.
The August meeting cancellation prompted the board to take the extraordinary action of scheduling its own special meeting on Wednesday.
Walters did not attend. In his absence, the present board members voted to hire an attorney and started the process to find a new board secretary.
In a statement through a spokesperson, Walters declined to explain why he missed so many meetings of his various state boards. He also did not answer whether expects future state Board of Education meetings to convene as scheduled or whether he might miss more. 
“My focus has been, and will continue to be, on reforming Oklahoma’s education system to put families and students first,” he said in the statement. “We’ve implemented bold reforms across the state to raise academic outcomes, empower parents, and ensure taxpayer dollars are being used wisely in the classroom.”
Wednesday was far from the only state board meeting this year where Walters was marked absent.
He hasn’t shown up for a single board meeting in 2025 for the Commissioners of the Land Office, a board that oversees state-owned school lands and assets that benefit public education funding.

Gov. Kevin Stitt, Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell, State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd and Agriculture Secretary Blayne Arthur also sit on the board and regularly attend its meetings at the state Capitol, records show.
Walters also skipped the only two meetings the state Board of Equalization has held this year in February and June, according to the State Auditor and Inspector’s Office, which keeps the board’s meeting records. The board meets four times a year to review and certify tax revenue that funds all of state government. 
Walters has missed four of the board’s meetings since he took office in January 2023, according to the board minutes.
Meeting records show Walters’ predecessor, former state Superintendent Joy Hofmeister, was a regular attendee of CareerTech, Commissioners of the Land Office and state Board of Equalization meetings in 2022, a year she was running for governor while in her final year of statewide office. 
Hofmeister also frequently attended the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority’s meetings until 2022, when she appeared only once. 
Walters attended no OETA meetings in 2023 and 2024, records indicate. Meeting minutes from 2025 aren’t available on OETA’s website, and a request for them wasn’t immediately returned.
He’s never shown up for a meeting of his assigned higher education board, either.
Under state law, whoever is elected state superintendent automatically has a seat on the board of regents for the Regional University System of Oklahoma. The RUSO regents govern six public universities, the largest being the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond.
Public records show Walters has never been marked present for a RUSO board meeting since he took office.
Hofmeister didn’t attend any RUSO meetings in 2022, either, but she attended one to two meetings each year over the three years prior, according to meeting minutes.
Chris Van Denhende served on the RUSO board from 2021 until February, when the governor appointed him to the state Board of Education.

He said Walters’ absence had no effect on the university system’s board or operations. A state superintendent’s attendance, though, could have given the regents an opportunity to question why so few Oklahoma high school students graduate ready for college-level academics.
“I find the bigger story is why our elected officials take so little interest in their responsibility,” Van Denhende said. “That said, we may be better off if they don’t attend at all. I’m so frustrated with the politics that go on.”
Van Denhende and three other Board of Education members leaned on Oklahoma City constitutional attorney Bob Burke and various state government officials to schedule and carry out their special meeting Wednesday. 
Burke, a historian and former state commerce secretary, said he hopes Walters will make a concerted effort to attend all future state Board of Education meetings. 
It’s important that he shows up for his other state boards too, Burke said, or that he chooses a designee to attend in his place, as state law allows.

Walters has chosen a designee for only two boards, the Statewide Charter School Board and the State Textbook Committee. His proxies on both boards have maintained regular attendance, meeting minutes show.
The multitude of boards that keep state government running are often made up of mostly unelected appointees.
That’s why it matters that elected officials show up, Burke said. If they don’t, the voters of Oklahoma don’t have their chosen representative present.
The state Board of Education is a prime example. Of its seven members, Walters is the only one whose name appears on a voting ballot. The governor appoints the rest.
“What the people lose is the vision of the (state) founders in holding all of our government accountable to the people,” Burke said.

(Courtesy of Lake Area Technical College)Leaders of the state’s technical college system plan to ask legislators for $11 million in one-time funds for renovation and building projects at two eastern South Dakota campuses.
Presidents from Lake Area Tech in Watertown and Southeast Tech in Sioux Falls shared their visions with the Board of Technical Education on Thursday during an online meeting. Executive Director Nick Wendell said the “timing feels appropriate” to pursue one-time state funding for the projects.
“I think, in both cases, they check some important boxes as we think about our strategic priorities and growing graduate capacity in the system between now and the middle part of the next decade,” Wendell said.
Technical college board endorses $49 million state budget request

Wendell will meet with Gov. Larry Rhoden and the Bureau of Finance and Management next week to discuss the one-time requests and board-approved $49 million ask in ongoing funding.
The board did not formally endorse or approve the one-time request, but Wendell said at the end of the meeting he sensed a “spirit of support” from members.
While state revenue projections for ongoing funding are tight, Wendell told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting that his organization typically enters legislative sessions “assuming there would be some one-time funding for targeted projects.”
“We’re following the same ongoing revenue projections everyone else is, including the funding that might be challenging to come by,” Wendell said. “But if there are opportunities for one-time funds, we wanted to identify some of those targeted projects we think would be great priorities to invest in.”
Lake Area Tech student center renovation
Lake Area Tech plans to renovate 14,000 square feet of its student center to centralize its services, including counseling, testing and adult education learning centers. The adult learning center is currently in a building that is “beyond its useful life,” President Tiffany Sanderson told board members, and is expected to be replaced by a new public safety training center in the coming years.
The student center renovation would cost $4 million. Lake Area Tech would cover $1 million and ask the state for $3 million.
Sanderson said state funding for the project will spur industry partners to invest in academic changes and other parts of the college’s master plan.
“The total plan over the next 10 years is about $100 million in investment, so this is just 4% of that total project,” Sanderson said. “But it’s a really critical 4% to build early momentum.”
Wendell told board members that to increase graduate numbers in the technical education system, colleges such as Lake Area will have to recruit more non-traditional students.
“In many cases, those are students that will need access to student services to find success on our campuses,” Wendell said. “And as a board, we’ve sort of been committed to this notion that we don’t just want to recruit and enroll a broader swath of students, but we want to ensure that they have access to the tools they need to be successful.”
Southeast Tech plans new building and expansion
Southeast Tech plans to build a new center for advanced manufacturing, which would rehouse its advanced manufacturing programs in maintenance technology and mechanical engineering and add 34,000 square feet of lab and classroom space. President Cory Clasemann said the school also plans to expand and renovate its welding space, adding 12,000 square feet for a welding lab and shared fabrication space with the advanced manufacturing programs.
The college’s construction, HVAC, mechanical engineering, plumbing and welding programs are all at capacity with a waiting list for enrollment. Advanced manufacturing, Clasemann said, is a priority because it accounts for one out of 10 jobs in South Dakota and is expected to grow its workforce by 6% through 2032 in the state.
“This is really the linchpin of several other pieces,” Clasemann said.

The project will cost $24 million overall. About $16 million will be spent on the advanced manufacturing building and $7 million on the welding lab expansion, with about $1 million in design fees.
The school has raised $1.5 million in private funding with plans to fundraise another $8 million. The Board of Technical Education plans to request $8 million from the state. The school secured $6.5 million through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the project, which are funds that must be spent by 2031.
“We’re mindful of federal spending at the moment, so we’d rather spend them sooner rather than later,” Clasemann said. “We are aware that, just with recissions going on, that they could go away.”
The project will double enrollment capacity for the school’s mechanical engineering program and increase its maintenance technology capacity by 50%. The increase in capacity will free up space for other program expansions.
Clasemann said the technical college needs “a couple more million dollars” to move forward with the advanced manufacturing building, which can begin without funding for the welding expansion and renovation.

Dorinne teaches reading to grades 5-8 at Barre Town Middle and Elementary School, and has served as principal of Leland and Gray Union High School in Townshend and Champlain Elementary School in Burlington.
It’s never too early to start reading instruction and intervention in our schools. The best time for students to obtain strong foundational reading skills is between prekindergarten and the second grade. During a child’s pre-K through kindergarten years, deficits in language, alphabetics and phonemic awareness that may develop are small. 
Effective intervention, especially at this early stage, can close these gaps. Unlike other developmental milestones (such as walking and talking), reading rarely develops without direct instruction. Consensus research has shown that literacy gaps in the earliest grades predict reading problems later. The longer schools wait to remediate, the greater the reading failure gap, the harder to correct and the less likely students will ever become proficient readers.
In the past, American schools have chosen to “wait and see” by giving students more time to develop reading skills. This approach has been renamed “wait to fail” because rarely did gaps close without evidence-aligned intervention. 
Vermont passed legislation in 2024, Act 139, which abandoned this approach. Parents/guardians can pay careful attention to see how their schools are providing effective intervention beginning at the youngest grades. 
Parents/guardians will know effective remediation is being delivered when they see their children’s growth by receiving detailed progress-monitoring assessments and hearing their children sound out new words and read aloud with fluency and accuracy. 
In fact, when students as early as pre-K and kindergarten demonstrate poor skills on these predictive assessments, schools should provide intervention right away to close existing gaps before these students fail to make reading progress. 
These assessments include:

The names and sounds of all letters in the alphabet
Rapid Automatized Naming, which are skills in retrieving the names of letters, numbers and objects accurately and automatically.
Oral language skills: speech articulation, vocabulary, grammar, understanding longer sentences, attention and following directions.

Act 139 requires all students in grades K-3 be assessed and receive classroom instruction in the five components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Assessments must be valid and reliable, and administered following the test’s technical specifications at least once a year. 
Schools must notify the parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient. Some schools have chosen to report all their students’ progress on the five reading components. Parents may always request results from these screenings.
Although Act 139 has put an end to misguided instructional approaches that have harmed student reading, thousands of Vermont students today continue to struggle to learn to read and write. 
For this reason, Act 72 — which was formerly called H.480 and was passed in June 2025 — requires public and approved independent schools to provide effective intervention to students significantly below proficiency in reading or whose poor reading skills impede school progress. 
Act 72 applies to all grades K-12 and requires an appropriately trained education professional to provide remediation. Schools must notify, support and share information with parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient. 
Carrying out Vermont’s reading laws provides every student the opportunity to learn to read well and succeed in school and adulthood.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)Plans to move forward with consolidating some local boards of Early Childhood Iowa were discussed at the ECI State Board Meeting Friday, though some members of the public brought up concerns about the loss of local control.
Consolidating the Early Childhood Iowa system came up earlier this year, when Gov. Kim Reynolds proposed legislation that would have shifted existing ECI funding, and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds, to create a new $16 million “continuum of care” competitive grant program for preschool and child care centers that offer full-day care for children.
The legislation ultimately did not pass in the 2025 legislative session, as multiple care providers and child care advocates brought up concerns that the measure would take 42% of current ECI funds, and serve a more limited group of child care providers. They also spoke in opposition to the potential regionalization of the ECI system, as Reynolds proposed aligning the boards that govern the program with the state’s Behavioral Health Services System regions.

This change would have consolidated the current 34 ECI area boards, which oversee funding for local initiatives and services for pre-kindergarten children, into seven boards.
Though this restructuring was not approved by the legislature, ECI state board members brought up the subject again at their Friday meeting. Some members of the board said having 34 local boards has made it difficult to gather data, manage contracts and perform oversight functions.
Emily Westergaard, the ECI state board chair, said that the discussion on restructuring was part of a larger conversation as the board weighs competing priorities while “recognizing that resources are finite and the needs are complex and interconnected.”
“This process calls for us to carefully consider data, diverse perspectives and potential trade offs, as well as have an understanding of how choices in one area may affect outcomes in another,” Westergaard said. “By approaching these decisions with transparency, fairness and a commitment to the greater good, I hope we can strengthen the Early Childhood Iowa network and make a lasting impact for our kids.”
But several advocates for local ECI boards, as well as other parties, asked for more time and deliberation on restructuring, and said the current structure does not have enough problems to justify the substantial changes.
Iowa Sens. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, and Mike Zimmer, D-Clinton, sent a letter to the state board Thursday asking the members to “exercise their autonomous oversight authority to cautiously consider any attempt to radically restructure ECI service areas.”
“We have seen no evidence that the current Early Childhood Iowa system is failing Iowans,” Winckler said in a statement. “Any attempt to massively overhaul the existing system without thoughtful, internal analysis could threaten the consistent local service on which our communities have come to rely.”
Kevin Grieme, the Health Director of the Siouxland District Health Department, cautioned ECI leaders to make sure the redistricting changes would be beneficial when considering the needs of different communities being served. He said the restructuring of public health boards brought up new concerns in terms of distributing funding or reaching agreements.
“When funding is given to us, we rightfully take a look at it and say, ‘what are our needs, (how do) we prioritize those?’ And I’m not sure you can reach that same sort of consensus and agreement and efficiencies related to that if your territory is too large,” Grieme said.
Grieme said “it’s going to be difficult to keep that local connection” if realignment means the districts move to mirror behavioral health districts.
“One of the things I strongly encourage you is to take the time and consideration and receive (feedback) from the local level to be able to basically justify whatever realignment configuration you develop,” Grieme said.
Unity Stevens, who led one of the work groups looking at restructuring, said it is important to note the new proposed ECI local boards structure “is not a mirror image of the behavioral health districts.”
“Those (behavioral health) districts were organized under a central provider of oversight with district advisory councils — ECI has historically been defined by a citizen-led forward structure, and that remains the intent going forward,” Stevens said.
She added that the new system, if changes are approved, would be “similar to our current setup, but it’s being shaped into a more streamlined structure.”
The next state board meeting is scheduled for Nov. 7, but members discussed the possibility of an earlier special meeting to discuss the restructuring.

“We had a car, table saw, boats, boat lifts, a lot of furniture,” said Lohry, the president of the McCook Lake Association. 
All of that junk and most of the sediment that washed into the lake have been removed, he said, now that the state’s $1 million cleanup is complete.

Following the June 2024 flood, surveys by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state officials estimated there was more than 20,000 cubic yards of sediment and debris in the lake.
The state awarded a contract to Three Oaks Construction of North Sioux City after a competitive bidding process. Work began on May 15 and concluded on the Aug. 1 deadline. That’s according to Game, Fish and Parks fisheries staffer Kip Rounds, who gave the department’s oversight commission a status update during a meeting Thursday in Rapid City. 
Crews used both land-based and barge-mounted excavators. The project was funded by the South Dakota Department of Public Safety’s emergency and disaster budget. 
The McCook Lake Association plans to pump water from the Missouri River next spring to return the lake to recreational levels. At that time, North Sioux City will reopen its public boat ramp at the lake, and the Department of Game, Fish and Parks will lift the no-wake restriction that has been in place since the flood.
What happened?
Three days of rain June 20-22, 2024, in southeast South Dakota surpassed 17 inches in some locations. Local and state authorities implemented a half-century-old diversion plan to handle record-high water that was flowing down the Big Sioux River toward Sioux City. They built a temporary levee across Interstate 29 that tied in with permanent levees to divert water into McCook Lake.
The water was supposed to flow through the 270-acre oxbow lake and drain toward the nearby Missouri River. Instead, it overwhelmed the lake and inundated many of the homes around it.
More than 100 homes near the lake were damaged, and 20 were destroyed. Many residents said the flood surge came suddenly, after they’d received little to no warning.
McCook Lake’s north shore neighborhood is still working to return the area to its pre-flood look, with some damaged homes, property and infrastructure remaining unrepaired.

(Photo by S. Shepard/Getty Images)North Carolina will receive more than $1 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve forestland, the agency announced this week.
The money is just a portion of the $8 million the USDA is spending on five projects across the country aimed at decreasing wildfire risk, protecting water quality and strengthening forest health, according to the federal agency.
In North Carolina, $1,022,106 will go toward the Uwharries to Sandhills, Phase 2 project, covering Montgomery, Moore, Randolph, Richmond and Stanly counties. It will be used to restore and improve about 18,000 acres in the Uwharrie National Forest through prescribed fire and silvicultural treatments, according to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).
Wildfires are a growing concern in North Carolina, agriculture commissioner Steve Troxler said earlier this year while asking lawmakers for more funding to tackle the issue.
The risks from wildfires are “expected to get worse, not better” throughout the year, Troxler said in April, according to WRAL.
The $8 million investment across the U.S. is the latest portion of the Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership Program, which is a collaboration between NRCS and Forest Service, to build public-private boundaries, according to the agency. The funding for new projects follows $32 million given to 24 existing 3-year-old Joint Chiefs’ projects.
“Wildfires have no boundaries, and neither should our prevention work,” USDA Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a press release, announcing the funding. “We need everyone at the table to deliver the kind of active management that will return our forests to health and productivity.”
Other projects receiving funding are in Alabama, Montana and Oregon, and a joint project in Colorado and Wyoming.
“Providing technical and financial assistance to private forest landowners is key to supporting locally led conservation, especially in the wildland-urban interface,” NRCS Chief Aubrey Bettencourt said in the release. This allows us to address multiple challenges in one project, such as reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire, protecting clean water, and improving wildlife habitat.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Uwharrie-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by Jay Biggerstaff/Getty Images)The LSU Board of Supervisors voted Friday to dramatically increase the salaries of two top members of its athletics department while the rest of campus faces new austerity measures. 
The board unanimously voted to increase LSU baseball coach Jay Johnson’s salary from $1.67 million to $3.05 million, following his program’s second national championship in the three years he’s been in charge. His pay will increase by $100,000 annually through the end of his contract in 2032. 
Board members also unanimously approved the contract of Julie Cromer, LSU’s new executive deputy athletics director and chief operating officer. Her annual compensation package increases the university’s spending for the position more than $150,000 a year. 
The pay increases were awarded as every other department on campus began returning 2% of the budgets they were allocated July 1 back to the university. The recoupment is in response to President Donald Trump’s slashing of federal research funding, which has dramatically impacted higher education finances nationwide. 
LSU had previously announced its athletics department would not be subject to the new money-saving measures. 
During difficult budget times in the recent past, LSU’s athletics department has provided money to the university. 
After Gov. Bobby Jindal made drastic cuts in the state budget, LSU athletics began making annual transfers to the school. It received tens of millions of dollars from its sports programs from 2012-19, spanning Gov. John Bel Edwards’ first term, until athletics director Scott Woodward ended the practice shortly after he took the job. 
Woodward declined to take questions Friday from reporters after the board meeting. 
Increasing athletics spending while academic departments tighten their belts has the potential to increase friction between the two. In a new survey, professors in Louisiana and across the South lamented the outsized focus on collegiate sports as higher education institutions struggle with shrinking budgets, loss of research funding and political attacks. 
LSU Board chairman Scott Ballard said tension between athletics and academics has always been there and always will. College sports bring value to the university from a marketing perspective, he said. 
“God knows I don’t create the market in athletics,” Ballard said. “If I did, these salaries would be far lower, but I can’t do anything about it.”
LSU Board vice chairman Lee Mallett pushed back on Deputy Athletics Director Lori Williams as she presented Johnson’s new contract, raising concerns about the financial impact of buying out poor-performing coaches. 
It is now industry standard that coaching contracts include a buyout clause, which require universities to pay out some or all of a coach’s promised compensation if they are fired without cause. Poor performance on the field is typically not considered a valid reason for a school to waive the buyout clause of a coach’s contract. 
LSU agreed to pay former head football coach Ed Orgeron $17 million when he was fired in 2021, though major donors are believed to have helped the athletics department cover the buyout. However, the university is legally on the hook for tens of millions of dollars in buyouts across all of its coaching contracts. 
Johnson’s buyout is 90% of his base and supplemental salary. 
Mallett said he doesn’t agree with the practice and LSU should be first to “break the mold.” 
Williams said without buyout clauses, LSU would not be able to attract top coaching talent. 
“We have to play the game with the rules that we’re given,” board members James Williams said.
Johnson is now the highest-paid college baseball coach in the country, surpassing Tony Vitello at the University of Tennessee at $3 million, according to The Advocate. 
The increase also edges Johnson closer to LSU women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey, who will make $3.35 million this upcoming season as part of her record-setting contract. 
LSU football coach Brian Kelly is the program’s highest-paid employee at approximately $9.9 million a year in total compensation. His current buyout figure exceeds $60 million.  
Cromer will receive a base salary of $400,000 with additional funding from the Tiger Athletic Foundation. For the first two years of her contract, her supplemental pay will be $110,000. For the second two years, the supplement increases to $130,000, and she can also earn incentives of up to $166,200 for the first two years and up to $168,600 for the second two years. 
LSU’s pay package for Cromer is substantially higher than what it paid former deputy executive AD Keli Zinn, who left LSU to become athletics director at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Zinn’s contract at LSU provided her with a $425,000 salary and up to $90,000 in incentives.
Paying Cromer, formerly Ohio University’s athletics director, above market rate for the position might have been necessary to lure her to a position with a lower title, industry observers have speculated.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Is a party switch by a Bergen County Democrat a sign of doom for Dems in this year’s race for governor, or a desperate push by the Republican candidate to project bipartisan bona fides?
That’s the question from Thursday night, when Jack Ciattarelli, the GOP former assemblyman hoping to seize the governor’s mansion back from Democrats, touted an endorsement from Garfield Mayor Everett E. Garnto Jr., a Democrat who said he is changing his party registration to Republican and backing Ciattarelli over Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

New Jersey under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy is broken, Garnto told reporters Thursday.
“Over the last seven and a half years, the policies that Murphy has put out, it’s ruining the state,” he said. “Mr. Ciattarelli is the guy to turn it around.”
Garfield, sandwiched between Routes 21 and 46 in southern Bergen County and home to about 6,300 registered voters, is not a purple city. After going for Republican George H.W. Bush over Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 campaign for the White House, it voted for the Democrat in every subsequent presidential race — until 2024, when it voted for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by about 1,000 votes. In governor’s races, Garfield voters also tend to stick with Democrats. In 2013, when Republican Gov. Chris Christie won statewide in a landslide over Democrat Barbara Buono, Christie’s margin of victory in Garfield was only about 100 votes. This is a Dem stronghold, one where Sherrill shouldn’t have to worry about a local Democrat campaigning against her.
Still, Garnto is no typical Democrat. Voter registration records indicate he was a Republican as recently as 2016, when he cast a ballot in that year’s GOP primary (when, of course, Trump ran his first campaign for the White House). He was a Democrat by 2020, though he does not appear to have participated in the June 2020 presidential primary.
A social media post from Garfield Mayor Everett Garnto showing off Trump-branded socks.
And he’s made no secret of his love for Trump. He posted on social media about going to Trump’s inauguration earlier this year, and in August 2023 he shared a close-up of Trump 2020 socks with the caption, “2024” followed by nine exclamation points. He told reporters on Thursday that he voted for Trump in November.
I asked Garnto about his back-and-forth party switches and he said local politics is what made him flip from Republican to Democrat years ago. Democrats dominate in Bergen County, and that’s the party with the money and the machine muscle.
“In 2016 is when I first ran for the board of education and people in Garfield basically said, ‘Hey, listen, you should join the Democratic Party.’ I was unaffiliated at that time, and I just did, and since then, I’ve voted for Democrats, Republicans,” he said.
Garfield’s local elections are nonpartisan, so Garnto’s political affiliation is largely irrelevant for his own campaigns. But merely the news that Ciattarelli has picked up an endorsement from a Democratic elected official in prized territory like Bergen County is good for Republicans, according to Dan Cassino, a pollster and government and politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
“Any Republican running statewide in New Jersey has to make themselves acceptable to moderate Democrats and independents, and pointing out support from Democrats is an easy way to do that. Chris Christie was very interested in getting Democratic endorsements for much the same reason. Saying that the Mayor of Garfield is on your side doesn’t help much, but saying that even Democrats in the state are backing the Republican does help,” Cassino told me.
Some Democrats may laugh at this idea, and cite public polling not just of the governor’s race but also of Trump’s job approval here in New Jersey. But my guess is they also would have laughed last October if someone told them Trump was going to win Passaic County.
To find out more about Garnto, I talked to someone who works with him and was once mayor of Garfield himself: Garfield Councilman Richard Rigoglioso, who goes by Richie Riggs. Rigoglioso, a Democrat, told me he respects Garnto’s decision to switch parties, but he hadn’t thought of the mayor as a Democrat.
“He’s more independent than Democrat,” Rigoglioso said.
Rigoglioso said he thinks Garfield swinging to Trump in 2024 was an aberration, the result of the last-minute switch at the top of the Dem ticket and not an indication that the town is lurching rightward.
“Is Ciattarelli going to win Garfield? Garfield’s still a blue city. It just happened to be that Trump was the better candidate that day. I don’t think our mayor is going to sway that pendulum one way or the other,” he said.

The state’s college governing board which oversees and selects the historically Black university’s leaders said Wednesday that the firm will help identify and recruit candidates for the search process. The news comes three weeks after officials made public plans to launch a search committee, where all 12 trustee members will serve. 
Marcus Thompson resigned as university president in May, the third person to depart from that post in seven years. The state’s college governing board did not explain why he or his two predecessors left the post nor has it shared with the public details about its next steps for picking a permanent leader for the school. 
Alumni and supporters of the historically Black university have raised questions to the board about its opaque process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.  
The IHL board’s formal request for proposals can be viewed on its website. The deadline for submission is Sept. 12. 
In 2023, IHL hired Academic Search, an executive headhunting firm, for $115,000 after Thomas Hudson, Thompson’s predecessor, resigned. The board also paid the firm $85,000 for the Delta State search. 
The initial contract with Academic Search for Delta State was $130,000, but it was amended after the board cut the search short and chose Daniel Ennis. The board also used the firm for University of Southern Mississippi search.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)The Washington State Department of Health has issued a standing order for the COVID-19 vaccine, making it easier for Washington residents to get vaccinated.
The standing order, announced Friday, allows most Washington residents to go directly to a pharmacy or clinic and receive the COVID-19 vaccine without an individual prescription. 
“The barriers to COVID-19 vaccination are complex, and the standing order is just one part of the solution,” State Health Officer Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett said in a written statement. “We want to ensure all Washington residents have access to the protection these vaccines provide based on the best available science.”
His action comes after the state along with Oregon and California formed the West Coast Health Alliance earlier this week. Hawaii joined Thursday.
The alliance is a direct response to concerns that recent federal actions have undermined the independence of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and politicized the use of science in ways that will harm public health.
Alliance members will establish a process to provide evidence-based unified recommendations to their residents regarding who should receive immunizations and help ensure the public has access to credible information for confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. 
“Washington State will not compromise when it comes to our values: science drives our public health policy,” said Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham. “Our commitment is to the health and safety of our communities, protecting lives through prevention, and not yielding to unsubstantiated theories that dismiss decades of proven public health practice.”
After Washington joined the alliance, the Department of Health reaffirmed its guidance that everyone 6 months and older, including pregnant people, should stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. 
This recommendation aligns with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
“COVID-19 vaccines are well-researched, well-tested, and have saved millions of lives around the world,” Kwan-Gett said. 
Washington’s standing order comes after the Food and Drug Administration last month approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the fall and, under the recommendation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., only recommended the vaccine to those over 65 and people with existing health problems. 
That approach severely limits access to COVID shots across the country. 
In Washington, the vaccine remains covered by most private insurers, Apple Health, and Washington’s Adult Vaccine and Childhood Vaccine programs. 
While some health care providers have already received this season’s COVID-19 vaccine, other providers are still waiting to receive supplies of the updated vaccine, which may limit appointments.

This story was originally published in the Current. 
The raid on the Hyundai electric vehicle plant was part of a lengthy investigation into the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens at the site that Gov. Brian Kemp and local officials had promised would create thousands of jobs for Georgians, federal officials said Friday.
Operation Low Voltage resulted in more than 475 people detained — more than 300 of whom were Koreans — while federal agents used a criminal search warrant to gather evidence at the battery plant that is a joint venture of Hyundai and LG, two of South Korea’s largest companies.
Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia and Alabama, said the raid was the largest single site enforcement operation ever carried out by the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement division.
Schrank told reporters that while some of the detained workers illegally crossed the U.S. border, others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working at the $7.6 billion site where Hyundai Motor Group and an interconnected group of suppliers are building vehicles.
Hyundai broke ground at the site two years ago after Georgia promised billions of dollars in tax credits and tax abatements if the world’s largest carmaker met its goals of creating more than 8,000 jobs at an average salary of approximately $58,000.
As of March, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, the legal entity that operates the site, reported that it had 1,200 people currently employed, not counting Koreans, and was operating one shift at the plant. At that time, the battery facility was not operational and remains under construction.
Federal officials said the majority of workers detained this week have been sent to Folkston, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency’s detention center in Charlton County.

The governor’s office responded to the raid by saying that state agencies remain committed to the rule of law. “All companies operating within the state must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation,” said spokesman Carter Chapman.
There was no immediate comment from Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.
In addition to the large number of Korean nationals, those detained included people from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela, according to Migrant Equity Southeast, a migrant worker advocacy group in Coastal Georgia.
The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.
“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.
Thursday’s operation was more complex than other ICE enforcement actions that have occurred since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year.
The raid involved 10 federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation unit, according to Margaret Heap, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia.
“This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks, and put them on buses,” Schrank said. “This has been a multi-month criminal investigation where we have developed evidence and conducted interviews, gathered documents and presented that evidence to the court in order to obtain a judicial search warrant.”
Neither Heap nor Shranck identified which court had issued the warrant. They also did not indicate if or when Bryan County authorities or those from neighboring counties, or company officials were notified about the operation.

(Courtesy of Children Youth and Families Department)In an abrupt announcement Friday, New Mexico governor’s office announced the same-day retirement of Teresa Casados, the latest secretary of the state’s beleaguered Children Youth and Families Department.
Casados is the fifth secretary in the last six years to oversee New Mexico’s child welfare department – the third to be confirmed, while two others have been interim.  CYFD has faced increased scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates, who say the department has failed to address housing of children in offices and issues of child maltreatment in custody which has lead to rising costs of settlements. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in April announced an investigation into a 16-year old foster child’s suicide.
New Mexico child welfare systems haven’t improved in last half year, arbiter finds

Casados was formally appointed to the position in January 2024, after serving as the interim secretary starting in May 2023, when retired state Supreme Court justice Barbara Vigil stepped down.
The governor’s announcement highlighted Casados’ “complete transformation of the agency,” noting she had launched a public transparency dashboard; conducted rapid hire events; and ended the practice of the agency using Social Security benefits belonging to children in care.
“I am deeply grateful for the opportunity I’ve had to work alongside families across New Mexico during my tenure at CYFD,” Casados said. “The dedicated employees at CYFD do their challenging and important work with compassion and heart, and I hope they are given every opportunity to show what they are capable of accomplishing in the months and years ahead. While there is always more work to do, I am confident that the foundation we have built will continue to serve New Mexico’s children and families well into the future.”
CYFD Deputy Director of Communications Jessica Preston declined Source NM’s request to speak with Casados. 
The latest change in leadership at the agency also comes amid the creation of a new oversight agency.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham thanked Casados for her work as a secretary and chief operating officer in the governor’s office prior to that, calling her a “trusted partner and valued leader,” in a statement.
“She stepped up to help manage our pandemic response and helped create the Early Childhood Education and Care Department. It’s fitting that she took on one of the toughest jobs in state government at CYFD in the last phase of her career in public service,” Lujan Grisham said.  “I am forever grateful to Teresa for hard work and dedication to the people of New Mexico. I wish her all the best in her retirement.”
The governor has designated CYFD Deputy Secretary Valerie Sandoval to lead the department. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a Source NM inquiry on when Casados gave notice of her retirement.
State Sen. Nicole Tobiassen (R-Albuquerque) told Source NM in a phone call Friday that Casados’ departure “was long overdue,” and called for Lujan Grisham to put finding a replacement secretary on the agenda for the Oct. 1 special session instead of appointing a successor. 
“This is an emergency situation,” Tobiassen said. “We’re asking her to do the right thing and allow us to put together an immediately qualified commission that goes out and finds the replacement.”
Tobiassen said she was working to put forward legislation to remove the secretary’s position from the governor’s office and establish an independent hiring commission with experts who can “hire the best person, not just for child welfare, but budget-wise,” as well. 
Several pieces of similar legislation introduced in the session earlier this year failed to make it to the governor’s desk. 
Casados previously served as deputy secretary of the Department of Workforce Solutions under former Governor Bill Richardson, and also worked in his office.

The Cobblestone Farm community, which rents single-family homes, duplexes and triplexes for $373 to $753 per month, is one of the latest projects aimed at addressing the affordable housing crisis in a region of Arkansas where the population has rapidly expanded, boosting housing costs. 
Addressing housing affordability is a key priority for the region because the median home price in Northwest Arkansas has grown 240% over the last six or seven years, said Brad Sikorski, president and CEO of the Excellerate Foundation, one of the partners in the Cobblestone Farm project.
“It’s a huge challenge that we face as a community, and we need more projects like this,” Sikorski said.
In addition to the Cobblestone Farm community, the Excellerate Foundation, is working on an affordable housing development for Bentonville School District employees and a new housing project in Rogers.

The Cobblestone Farm community, which opened to renters earlier this year and is already at capacity, is the result of partnerships between multiple organizations, including Strategic Realty, which is led by Van Buren Republican state Sen. Jim Petty, and New Heights Church, which owns the land and is renting it for $1 per year for 99 years. 
The Fayetteville City Council annexed and rezoned 30 acres for the project in 2020, and officials broke ground in 2022, according to the Fayetteville Flyer. 
“We hope [this] will be a long-term, life-changing investment in affordable housing here in Fayetteville,” Petty said. 
The Arkansas Development Finance Authority provided more than 90% of resources used to finance the nearly $21 million project by accessing the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program and the National Housing Trust Fund, ADFA Director of Tax Credits John Blackwell said. 
The Fayetteville development was also supported by an $850,000 Affordable Housing Program grant awarded by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas through Arvest Bank for construction costs, according to a press release. 
A 2019 report brought Northwest Arkansas’ affordable housing issue into focus. A new study released in May that builds on that report found that housing priority needs identified five years ago — a lack of regional housing policies, need for diverse housing options, limited choices for low-income households and weak links between housing and transportation — remain “even more acute.”
Groups throughout the community have started tackling the issue through various strategies, including the creation of a workforce housing center that announced the creation of a 77-unit mixed-income apartment project in downtown Springdale in 2023. More recently, the University of Arkansas celebrated the dedication of a new timber-focused facility last week where students can work on affordable housing solutions.
‘Water, sewer building a hot subject around here,’ Northwest Arkansas consultant says

Efforts to construct more housing to meet the demands of the region’s growing population have been stymied in some cities due to a lack of wastewater infrastructure. The state appears to be taking steps to address that issue with the governor’s announcement last week of a comprehensive water reclamation study to inform the state’s water plan and guide future wastewater infrastructure projects in Northwest Arkansas. 
Meanwhile, discussions around the housing issue are expected to continue between lawmakers and the public. On Thursday, state and Northwest Arkansas elected officials discussed ways to address housing costs during a housing conference in Cave Springs, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. Petty attended the summit and told the Advocate Friday that all meetings like that are productive, but it’s just the beginning because “there’s a lot of work to be done.” 
During the 2025 legislative session, Petty introduced a bill focused on the housing crisis that has since been sent to interim study. Officials won’t be able to spend their way out of this problem and instead will have to consider a combination of tactics, such as reforming building and zoning policies and providing better education on the topic, Petty said.
“There’s just a lot of things that need to happen, and I think the more we talk about it and the more that we do it in a way that is collaborative and we put our own personal preferences and our own egos out of the way, the sooner that we can get to solving the real problems,” he said. 
In another effort to keep the conversation going, the Northwest Arkansas Council announced Thursday an eight-day series of community meetings and events seeking input on the region’s growth. The Growing Home NWA Roadshow kicks off Sept. 17 in Centerton. A full schedule is available here.

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Supreme Court)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court on Friday said a lawsuit from a La Vista mother whose son went missing from his elementary school in 2021 can proceed, at least for now.
Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Stephanie Stacy said a Sarpy County District Court judge prematurely dismissed a 2021 case from Tammi Larsen. Larsen alleges Papillion-La Vista Community Schools and three school employees were negligent in caring for her then-11-year-old son Ryan, who went missing in May 2021 and has not been seen since.
Larsen alleges the district’s negligent supervision of Ryan led to his disappearance. Ryan had a history of leaving or attempting to leave school and had been diagnosed with autism, Tourette’s Disorder and absence seizures.
Ryan had left school three times in the months before his May 17, 2021, disappearance. He was on an individualized education plan that was regularly updated and modified.
Attorney Justin Pritchett for the Larsen family said in a statement: “The Nebraska Supreme Court made the right and just decision today. The Larsen family will continue to seek answers to hold the school district accountable to obtain justice for Ryan.”
Papillon-La Vista and its attorneys did not immediately respond to requests Friday for comment.
Court documents say school officials allegedly left Ryan unsupervised, and three unnamed school employees watched as Ryan walked out of school on May 17, 2021, never to return.
“School district staff did not attempt to prevent Ryan from leaving the school grounds and made no immediate attempts to retrieve him and return him to school,” the opinion states.
Larsen alleges that the inaction inflicted emotional distress on her. Given district knowledge of Ryan’s age, disability and history of elopement, court documents state, “it was reckless, outrageous and intolerable to leave him alone and to permit him to leave the school building unattended,” which likely resulted in Ryan’s death or serious physical harm.
Sarpy County District Judge George Thompson dismissed Larsen’s case in May 2024, stating the school district couldn’t be sued under “sovereign immunity” protections, the concept that a government can’t be sued unless its immunity is waived or unless the law expressly allows such a lawsuit.
Thompson said Larsen’s allegation of negligent supervision was not allowed due to exemptions for “due care” or the “discretionary function” of government. As a result, the emotional distress claim was barred, too. The district court also said Larsen couldn’t allege “sufficient facts” to show she was “a seriously injured victim.”
But Stacy said it was too soon to make those determinations without at least letting the case proceed a little longer and determining whether there was “any plausible path” to proceed.
The lower court determined that the complaint’s reference to Ryan’s IEP concerned “legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic and political policy.” So, it was a “matter of circumstances and choice” for the district to leave Ryan alone. It said the district’s supervision decisions were a matter of implementing Ryan’s IEP.
The Nebraska Supreme Court said Larsen’s complaint alleged no facts about Ryan’s IEP, nor did it even include it in the court file, and officials knew Ryan “had a propensity to wander off the school grounds if left alone.”
Stacy wrote that determining the applicability of the exemptions “must await a more developed factual record.”
In 2023, Larsen also filed a case seeking to declare Ryan legally deceased. Under state law, a missing person can be presumed dead after five years, “unless there is sufficient evidence” otherwise. A judge said Larsen had not met that burden.
Stacy cautioned that Larsen’s case is not built around whether Ryan is deceased and wrote that it is plausible Ryan has suffered a serious injury. Stacy wrote that it is reasonable that Larsen “suffered emotional distress that was medically diagnosable and so severe no reasonable person should be expected to endure it.”
The case will return to Sarpy County District Court and continue.

The students walked out during their study period to bring attention to the prevalence of school shootings in America. A number of student speakers took time to share their message in the stadium, speaking against deadly gun violence and calling for policies to strengthen gun safety in schools. Students returned to class by the start of their third period.
“Although the school division does not assist with the organization of events such as this, our staff does take steps to monitor students to ensure they remain safe at all times. While we always want students to remain in class, we acknowledge their right to speak up for their beliefs and appreciate the peaceful and respectful manner in which they did so,”  Hermitage High School principal Michael Jackson said in a statement.
The event, created by the advocacy group Students Demand Action, spurred walkouts in schools across the country. A map on the group’s website showed students in 27 schools in the commonwealth registered to officially participate in the protest, spanning Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and Hampton Roads. One school in Blacksburg was slated to have students participate.
Current students have been called the “school shooting generation,” according to Students Demand Action. Many schools across the nation have only been back in session for a couple weeks but there’s already been a mass shooting at a catholic school in Minneapolis, which claimed the lives of two children and injured dozens more in late August.
 In 2023, Virginia was rocked by a deadly shooting at Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony in downtown Richmond, where 18-year-old graduate Shawn Jackson and his father were killed and several were wounded. Lawmakers and civil rights groups have since called for more resources to prevent gun violence in Virginia schools.
Students Demand Action advocates against policies they feel would lead to dangerous access to guns. They also push for more gun safety laws and protocols passed in state legislatures.

Greg Stanton, one of the co-sponsors. “This bill gives FEMA independence and tools it needs to respond to disaster.”Republican Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Eric Burlison of Missouri and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania voted against reporting the bill to the House floor. Their offices didn’t respond to requests for comment asking why they opposed the legislation.

The 207-page measure, formally called the Fixing Emergency Management for Americans (FEMA) Act of 2025, would remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security and make it a Cabinet-level agency.The legislation would create one application for federal natural disaster assistance from FEMA, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration. It would also give local and state governments more flexibility in deciding which types of emergency housing best meet the needs of their residents following different natural disasters. Republicans and Democrats on the committee praised the various changes the measure would make during a two-hour markup that offered an increasingly rare example of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Donations from charities and FEMANorth Carolina Republican Rep. David Rouzer and California Democratic Rep. Laura Friedman both spoke in support of a provision reversing a policy that they said penalized people who received assistance from charities following a natural disaster. “Too many families who accept a donation from a charity or take an SBA loan to keep the lights on find out later that accepting those essential resources prevents them from receiving other assistance later for which they otherwise would be eligible,” Rouzer said. “This bill makes clear that SBA loans and private charitable donations are not considered duplicative for FEMA individual assistance.”Friedman said she was shocked to learn that FEMA counted charitable donations against disaster survivors following the Los Angeles wildfiresThat led her to introduce the Don't Penalize Victims Act with Mississippi Republican Rep. Mike Ezell, which was rolled into the FEMA overhaul bill. “I want to thank all the members of this committee, and particularly Chair (Sam) Graves and ranking member (Rick) Larsen, for their understanding of the importance of this measure to victims, who were seeing the charity that their churches, that their friends are raising for them be counted as income and deducted from the amount they were getting from FEMA,” Friedman said. Oregon Democratic Rep. Val Hoyle spoke in support of making FEMA a Cabinet-level department, saying that it’s been bogged down in the Department of Homeland Security since just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “After being folded into the Department of Homeland Security, it became buried in layers of bureaucracy,” Hoyle said. “DHS's sprawling mission — cybersecurity, counterterrorism, immigration enforcement, transportation security and more — has left FEMA less able to act with the speed and agility disaster-stricken communities need.”Hoyle said the legislation restoring FEMA’s “independence will help insulate disaster relief from” the types of “political pressures” that exist throughout the Homeland Security Department.Permitting reformDespite the broadly bipartisan support for the legislation within the committee, it will likely undergo some changes in the weeks and months ahead. House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and ranking member Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who both sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, raised concerns with elements in the FEMA overhaul bill during the markup. Westerman said he voted for the bill but expected the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s leadership to work with him to address concerns over ""permitting reform issues"" that fall under his panel’s jurisdiction. “There is one provision on the Endangered Species Act that we have concerns with actually being executable the way it's written,” Westerman said. “Again, that's something that's fixable, and we look forward to working with you as we move forward on the bill.”Huffman said he had concerns about how the FEMA overhaul bill addresses “environmental review statutes,” which fall under the Natural Resources Committee’s purview. “I, of course, share the goal of cutting red tape. We want disaster-stricken families to be able to rebuild faster. There are ways to do that that also ensure that recovery is durable, resilient and sustainable. That we rebuild once. These are things that (the National Environmental Policy Act) helps to ensure. So I look forward to continuing to work with the committee on this as the bill advances. This is a problem that can be fixed, and I hope it will,” Huffman said. Potomac River water Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members offered just two amendments to the bill — one adopted by voice vote and one withdrawn. Indiana Democratic Rep. André Carson received broad support for his amendment to require FEMA to inform members of Congress about grants within their districts, a practice he said has changed during the Trump administration. “We should not need to mandate transparency and accountability, but if FEMA fails to provide this information, my amendment codifies the traditional notifications to Congress,” Carson said. Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, offered and then withdrew an amendment that would have required FEMA “to submit to Congress a plan to supply emergency drinking water to the nation’s capital region during any period the Potomac River becomes unusable.”Offering and then withdrawing an amendment is a common way for members to highlight issues without forcing a vote. Norton said the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the city’s water supply, only has sufficient reserves for one day should something happen. “If the Potomac River becomes unusable, which could happen at any moment whether through manmade or natural events, it would pose a significant risk to the residents of the nation’s capital, the operations of the federal government, national security and the region’s economy,” Norton said. Congress has partially funded a study to identify a backup drinking water supply and additional water storage facilities. But, Norton said, “any solution is years away.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-05 15:58:29.370020

(Dan Reynolds Photography/Getty Images)The company overseeing North Carolina’s Hurricane Helene homebuilding program is no longer facing a ban on government contracts in West Virginia.
In a letter sent Thursday, a West Virginia official informed Horne LLP that her department’s proposed ban on the company would be “permanently withdrawn.”
The proposed ban, sent on July 22 and previously reported by NC Newsline, had cited a settlement Horne made with the federal government months earlier. Prosecutors had alleged that the Mississippi-based company created fictitious applicant information and failed fraudulent invoices during a disaster recovery program; Horne denied any wrongdoing and settled for $1.2 million.
Samantha Willis, who leads the state’s contracting agency, wrote to Horne officials that “having reviewed your response” to the proposed ban and “giving consideration to the facts and circumstances” of the situation, she would withdraw it.
In her original letter, Willis wrote that Horne had demonstrated a “‘wanton indifference’ to the interests of the public.” Horne “strongly disagreed” with the letter, and later sent a formal response.
“Today, we received confirmation that the proposed debarment notice from West Virginia has been permanently withdrawn,” Horne CEO and managing partner Rusty Butcher said in a statement to NC Newsline on Thursday evening. “While the initial notice was unexpected, we’ve remained transparent throughout and consistently demonstrated that no wrongdoing occurred.
“We’re pleased with the resolution and value our collaboration with the State of West Virginia,” Butcher added. “Our focus remains on making a positive impact in communities recovering from disaster — and doing so as the premier firm in the field.”
A spokesperson for Horne, Meg Annison, said the company cited “procedural concerns and a lack of substantiated legal grounds” in its response. The company did not provide a copy of its full response to West Virginia upon request by NC Newsline.
West Virginia’s Department of Administration, which includes the contracting division, did not respond to a request for comment.
Horne won an $81 million contract from North Carolina earlier this year to manage its western homebuilding program after Hurricane Helene.

At a Sept. 4, 2025, hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced heated questions from numerous senators about his vaccine policies, including his stance on COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA vaccine technology generally.
Although Kennedy agreed that Operation Warp Speed, President Donald Trump’s signature initiative to produce COVID-19 vaccines in nine months, was a tremendous achievement, he also maintained that COVID-19 vaccines cause widespread and serious harm, including death, particularly in young people – a claim for which there is no evidence.
Some especially pointed questions came from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who provided the final vote needed for Kennedy’s confirmation in February 2025 after Kennedy promised him that he would not change the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s process for recommending vaccines. Cassidy pointed out that with the limitations and confusion caused by the CDC’s new rules around COVID-19 vaccines, “I would say effectively we are denying people vaccines.” To which Kennedy replied, “Well, you’re wrong.”
At the hearing, Kennedy stood by his decision to cut US$500 million in HHS funding for 22 research contracts on mRNA vaccine technology. HHS has said it will instead pour these funds into research on a traditional approach to designing vaccines that was first used more than 200 years ago. With such vaccines, called whole-virus vaccines, a person’s immune system is presented with the whole virus, often in weakened or inactivated form. This switcheroo has puzzled many scientists.
A few days before the hearing, on Sept. 1, Trump demanded that pharmaceutical companies prove that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work, saying that the CDC was “being ripped apart over this question.” It was his first public acknowledgment of the chaos roiling the CDC amid the firing of its director, Susan Monarez, and subsequent resignations of four high-level agency officials.
Meanwhile, public health experts and HHS staffers are calling for Kennedy to be fired, and several senators at the hearing echoed that call.
As a vaccinologist who has studied and developed vaccines for over 35 years, I see that the science behind mRNA vaccine technology is being widely misstated. This incorrect information is shaping long-term health policy in the U.S. – which makes it urgent to correct the record.
Are mRNA vaccines less safe than whole-virus vaccines?
HHS defended its cancellation of mRNA vaccine research based, in part, on a nonpeer-reviewed compilation of selected publications called the COVID-19 mRNA “vaccine” harms research collection. This document lists about 750 articles claimed to describe harms caused by mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. However, the vast majority of these articles aren’t about vaccines but about the harms of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. And notably absent from it is the huge body of data showing mRNA vaccines actually prevent these harms.
Spike proteins on SARS-COV-2 can cause tissue damage – and although mRNA vaccines produce them in small amounts, they prevent the virus from replicating to produce them in large amounts.(Source: https://www.scientificanimations.com/wiki-images/, CC BY-SA)
For example, the document being used to justify RFK Jr.’s claims about mRNA vaccines highlights 375 studies reporting that the virus’s spike protein alone, which is produced when the virus replicates, can cause excessive inflammation and tissue damage. This is true. But the document marshals this evidence to support the claim that mRNA vaccines, which are designed to produce spike proteins, cause the same harm – which is not accurate.
While viral replication results in uncontrolled production of a large amounts of the protein, the way it’s produced by the mRNA vaccine is very different. The vaccine produces a small, controlled amount of spike protein inside a few cells – just enough to induce an immune response without causing damage. And by blocking the virus’s replication, it reduces the amount of spike protein in circulation, actually having the opposite effect.
What about side effects like myocarditis?
Early reports flagged a type of heart swelling called myocarditis as a rare side effect of the mRNA vaccine, particularly for young men ages 18 to 25 after a booster dose. A 2024 review identified about 20 cases out of 1 million people who received the vaccine. However, that same study found that unvaccinated people had an elevenfold higher risk of getting myocarditis after a COVID-19 infection than vaccinated people.
What’s more, another 2024 study showed that people who developed myocarditis after vaccination had fewer complications than those who developed the condition after getting infected with COVID-19.
Do mRNA vaccines make the SARS-CoV-2 virus resistant?
Another claim from the compilation of supposed mRNA vaccine harms that was cited as a reason for cutting funding for mRNA technology is that mRNA vaccines cause mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus that make them resistant or less susceptible to the vaccine.
When a virus replicates in its host, it produces millions of copies of its genetic material. Mutations are copying errors that occur naturally during the replication process. These acquired mutations produce new variants, which is why both the COVID-19 mRNA and the whole-virus flu vaccine get updated annually – to keep up with natural changes in the virus.
Slowing down viral replication decreases the rate at which a virus can acquire new mutations. Since both mRNA and whole-virus vaccines stop or slow the virus from replicating, both types of vaccines help reduce the emergence of resistant viruses.
Viruses can mutate to escape from antibodies, but the mRNA vaccines are not causing the emergence of more virulent strains, likely for at least two reasons. First, mRNA vaccines induce immune responses that can attack the virus at multiple spots, so it would have to come up with many mutations at once to escape the vaccine’s defenses. Second, even if the virus could acquire all these mutations, they would likely weaken it, making it unable to cause or even transmit disease.
mRNA vaccines versus new SARS-CoV-2 variants
Kennedy, in announcing cuts to mRNA vaccine research on Aug. 5, 2025, claimed that mRNA vaccines don’t work against respiratory viruses and that HHS was moving toward “safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.”
Both whole-virus vaccines and mRNA vaccines protected against COVID-19 and prevented hospitalization and death for millions of people worldwide between 2020 and 2024, but there’s clear evidence that the mRNA-based vaccines provided significantly better protection than whole-virus vaccines. And for COVID-19, mRNA vaccines are more effective against new variants, which emerge as viruses mutate, than whole-virus vaccines.


 mRNA vaccines’ superpower is that they can be updated and manufactured very quickly, unlike traditional whole-virus vaccines.

The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines started with exceptionally high efficacy, exceeding 94%. When the SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants emerged in the spring and fall of 2021, mRNA vaccines became less effective in preventing infections. However, they remained highly effective in preventing severe illness, whereas in unvaccinated people the rates of severe illness and hospitalization remained high.
This is because mRNA vaccines induce the immune system to make both antibodies and specialized immune cells called T cells. These elements can recognize multiple parts of the virus, including ones that don’t change, enabling significant protection against new variants.
What’s more, the mRNA vaccines have a superpower that no other type of vaccine can currently match: They can be quickly updated and manufactured within two to three months. To develop a whole-virus vaccine, researchers must first spend months isolating and propagating the virus. Conversely, making an mRNA vaccine requires just sequencing the virus’s genetic code – a process that today takes just hours.
If a new pandemic began today, mRNA vaccines are currently the only type of vaccine that could be developed quickly enough to disrupt its spread.
The future of mRNA vaccine technologies
Thirty years ago, when scientists first started developing mRNA vaccine technology, they recognized its potential to overcome major limitations of whole-virus vaccines – namely, slow production time and more limited ability to protect from new viral variants. Today, mRNA vaccines are also being developed to prevent or treat diseases including HIV and cancer, as well as autoimmune and genetic diseases.
Of course, this technology can be further improved. New mRNA vaccine technologies are aimed, among other things, at making mRNA vaccines easier to store to allow for faster distribution and reduce their short-term side effects, eliminate the rare risk of myocarditis and more quickly block a respiratory infection.
The National Institutes of Health is funneling money away from new mRNA technologies toward a single project developing universal vaccines based on traditional whole-virus vaccine technology. Universal vaccines are urgently needed to provide broader protection against ever-changing respiratory viruses, such as influenza, that are major pandemic threats.
A 2022 study in mice and ferrets showed that a universal flu vaccine NIH plans to support has promise. However, multiple studies of potential universal flu vaccines based on mRNA technology show even more potential. Such vaccines could induce broader immunity than whole-virus vaccines by eliciting antibody and T-cell responses that target an even wider range of flu viruses.
It’s hard to square those benefits with the fact that HHS and NIH have named the planned new universal vaccine platform “Generation Gold Standard,” insisting that it represents a new standard in science and transparency. The effort seems more akin to eliminating all e-bike technology and telling everyone who seeks one to get by with a single brand of a 10-speed bike: Getting to the intended destination may still be possible, but it will be slower and harder.
And in the case of abandoning mRNA vaccine research, it may lead to lives needlessly lost, whether due to potential medicines untapped or to pandemic unpreparedness.

Jason Prokop of Lincoln testifies before the Business and Labor Committee about an interim study he introduced examining the internNE program. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state-funded internship program that was slashed this year to balance Nebraska’s budget still has  a push behind it as a means of keeping young talent in the state. 
Earlier this year, State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln filed an interim study to consider the internNE program’s impact on brain drain in Nebraska. The study led to a public hearing Friday before the Nebraska Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee. 
Prokop, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, is keenly aware of Nebraska’s ongoing financial constraints but said maintaining internNE would come with returns on investment that would help the state in the long run.

He and five other invited testifiers largely argued that every student who chooses to stay in Nebraska through the program increases revenues that will eventually come back to the state. 
“Every dollar we spend helping a student launch their career here multiplies through workforce retention, stronger businesses and stronger communities,” said one testifier Levi Thiele, career services director for University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
InternNE originated under former Gov. Dave Heineman, but was boosted in 2022 through a $20 million investment approved by the Legislature. Since then, Prokop said the program has aided more than 1,500 internships and distributed more than $8 million in grants. 
The roughly $11 million left in the program was reappropriated this year to help fill a fluctuating budget deficit that at one point grew as high as $432 million. It was part of more than $218 million in various transfers into the state’s general fund during fiscal year 2025-26. 
These budget struggles are likely to continue, as the state is once again facing a projected deficit of around $95 million. That figure is likely to increase over the coming months, due to the impacts from the federal budget reconciliation bill and economic factors. 
Even Prokop said it was too early to say if refunding internNE would be possible when lawmakers return for their 60-day session in 2026. 
“I want to see it funded, but I’m also a realist,” Prokop said. 
Nebraska has long struggled with a labor shortage, exacerbated by a trend of young people leaving the state after finishing their education. Prokop said between 2010-2020, Nebraska on average lost about 6,000 residents per year, with a particularly high amount of them being college-educated young people. 
“Nebraska faces a looming demographic cliff,” said another testifier Tyler White, political science professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “We see it already in declining school enrollments, and soon we will feel it more acutely in our workforce.” 
There is evidence that internNE helped slow Nebraska’s brain drain, Prokop said. Citing data from UNO’s School of Public Affairs, he said 2022 — the same year the state boosted funding for the program — saw fewer young people leave Nebraska compared to neighboring years. 
Prokop also cited data from the Nebraska Statewide Workforce & Educational Reporting System claiming that paid internships create at least a 50% probability of talent retention. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who chairs the Business and Labor Committee, questioned how many students who have participated in internNE choose to remain in Nebraska because of the program. She argued that the program doesn’t have as much benefit for students already planning to stay. 
Prokop wasn’t able to provide hard data to prove internNE keeps students in the state. However, Thiele said, she witnessed firsthand multiple students making that choice because of their internships. 
Kauth also asked whether it should be the business’ responsibility to fund their own internship programs and not the state’s. 
“I’m just wondering at what point profitable companies are asking taxpayers … to pay for their staff and pay for their growth and development,” Kauth said. 
Prokop countered that participating businesses must match some of the reimbursements they receive through the program. He also noted that internNE doesn’t fund interns’ compensation, but instead helps interns overcome other barriers to work, including housing and travel. 
Dawson Brunswick, president of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce and another testifier, said short-term housing for interns is effectively nonexistent in his area. It reached a point where the chamber itself funded two short-term housing complexes for interns in response to the demand for labor. 
Kauth then wondered if this approach may give students a false sense of what housing and travel costs would be once their internship ended. But White argued that interns often are paid fairly low wages, and if they secure a full-time position afterwards that would help make up the shifting costs. 
“I really feel like students today are struggling more with money than they have before,” White said. “And so if we can do things to lower those costs for them, I think you’re going to find that it can be that little hand-up that puts them on the pathway to (success).”
Prokop said internNE isn’t a “cure all” for Nebraska’s workforce challenges. He said he favors an “all-of-the-above approach” that would incorporate the program with several other initiatives to retain talent, including dual enrollment and apprenticeships. 
He also noted that many other states offer similar programs to internNE and argued that Nebraska must remain competitive if officials don’t want the problem to worsen. 
“If we aren’t recruiting them, we’ll lose them,” said another testifier Dan Curran, executive director of UNO’s Nebraska Business Development Center.

According to the World Meteorological Organization and NOAA, every year from 2015 to 2024 ranked among the 10 warmest years on record, making the past decade the hottest in the last roughly 175 years. In fact, WMO confirmed in January that 2024 was the hottest year ever recorded, beating the record set just one year prior.
Global temperatures in 2024 were about 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 20th-century average. For 14 straight months, through July 2024, the world set new monthly heat records. Both land and ocean temperatures hit all-time highs, and ocean waters stored more heat than ever before.
Scientists say this ongoing rise is tied to greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere. The world is now dangerously close to passing the 1.5 degree Celsius global average temperature limit set in the Paris Agreement, a key target for avoiding the worst climate impacts.

In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order Friday morning to authorize pharmacists to provide the shot to anyone who desires it for the next 30 days, which can be renewed.
“When they said that they are not going to be requiring COVID shots and other vaccinations for our families, I said, ‘No, here in New York we will make parents have the option.’ If you want your child to have a COVID shot, it should be available to you and it should be covered by insurance,” Hochul said during a news conference Friday morning, where she signed the order.
“So what I’m doing now is signing an executive order, because extreme times call for extreme measures. And this is the power I have to use in the interim until we are able to have the legislature get back in January and pass legislation that mandates this.”
As Florida plans to end all vaccine mandates, Western states form vaccine alliance

Previous FDA policy recommended that COVID-19 vaccine booster shots be made available to anyone 6 months or older regardless of their health status. But in August, the federal agency announced restrictions for the new shot.
The FDA limited access to the vaccines to people who are 65 and older and to younger people with at least one underlying health condition, such as asthma or obesity, that would put them at risk of developing a severe illness without a booster shot. Children are eligible only if a medical provider is consulted. Additionally, the Pfizer vaccine, one of the three that were approved, will no longer be available for any child under 5.
“The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media platform X on Aug. 27.
Other states are also taking measures to ensure more people can get access to the vaccines.
On Thursday, Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey ordered health insurers in the state to continue covering the vaccine. The state also issued an order to allow pharmacies to continue providing shots to residents above the age of 5.
Massachusetts is “leading efforts to create a public health collaboration with states in New England and across the Northeast committed to safeguarding public health as the federal government backs away from its responsibilities,” the governor’s office said in a release.
This week, the State Board of Pharmacy in Pennsylvania held a special meeting to vote to bypass federal vaccine recommendations and allow pharmacists to continue administering COVID-19 vaccines.
“Health care decisions should be up to individuals — not the federal government and certainly not RFK Jr. My Administration will continue to protect health care access for all Pennsylvanians,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said.
Colorado and New Mexico took similar steps this week, with state officials signing public health orders asking state agencies to take steps necessary to require insurers to cover the vaccines and instructing pharmacists to provide the shots without a doctor’s note.

Cox spoke alongside Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, discussing issues like bipartisanship, the deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities and declining trust in government institutions. 
The governor’s comments on Utah’s redistricting case came toward the end of the hour-long discussion — and on the heels of a major political shakeup in Utah. 
Last week, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson ruled the Utah Legislature violated the state constitution in 2021 when it overturned a voter-approved ballot initiative that created an independent redistricting commission meant to prevent partisan gerrymandering. 
A judge has ruled Utah’s congressional map unconstitutional. What now?

Known as Proposition 4, lawmakers repealed and replaced it with a new law in 2021, turning the commission into an advisory body — the legislature then decided to adopt its own congressional map, ignoring the commission’s recommendations. Several groups then sued the legislature and were handed a victory on Aug. 25. 
Now, following Gibson’s ruling, the Utah Legislature must publish new maps that adhere to the guidelines outlined in the ballot initiative. 
“I do disagree in this case, this is a really tough one,” Cox said. “Democrats in our state desperately want a district, even though Republicans outnumber them three to one in the state. The only way to get a Democratic district in the state is to gerrymander.” 
Still, Cox had a warning for politicians of all stripes. 
“There is nothing in the history of our country that makes people angrier and makes them lose trust than when they feel like the government is not being responsive to them,” Cox said.

The event also came in the wake of controversial redistricting decisions in other states. Texas Republicans recently approved new congressional maps despite not yet reaching the 10-year mark that coincides with the U.S. Census, when redistricting typically occurs. The move has been widely condemned by Democrats as an attempt to give the GOP extra seats in the U.S. House, and prompted California politicians to try and redraw their own maps to favor Democrats in order to offset Texas. 
It’s yet another reason for voters to lose faith in government, Cox said. 
“I share the concerns of my colleague, Gov. Moore, I hate gerrymandering, and I especially hate doing it twice in 10 years,” Cox said. “That’s the only thing worse than doing it every 10 years. And so there has to be a better way.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250821_GovPressConf_1005_re-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 14:57:34.776119

State Rep. Eric Bell, a Jonesboro Democrat who served in the U.S. Navy, criticized Kemp’s decision in a phone interview Friday and described it as a threat to American freedom and a return to feudalism.
Rep. Eric Bell. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“This isn’t the America that I was promised in social studies. This isn’t the America that I bought into as a veteran who defended this country. I’m all out of thoughts and prayers. Time for action.” Bell said, calling for people to stay united and vigilant against authoritarianism.
After Trump said that he may deploy troops to New Orleans, Bell said it’s “only a matter of time” before troops are deployed in Atlanta.
D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb sued the Trump administration Thursday over the ongoing presence of National Guard troops in Washington, arguing the deployment amounts to a military occupation and violates the district’s right to self-rule.
According to the state department of defense, up to 16 support staff from the Georgia Guard were sent this week to Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling to serve as medical, physician assistant and military police support staff. A larger deployment of 300 Georgia Guard soldiers is scheduled to mobilize in mid-September, but the timing is subject to change.
The Georgia Guard is joining more than 2,200 National Guard members from seven other states to provide support to D.C. law enforcement. Louisiana, South Dakota, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi and South Carolina have sent troops to the nation’s capital. 
The troops, who may be armed, will have a visible presence in the city, with their specific duties determined by the needs of their law enforcement partners, according to a press release.
Kemp’s office stated that there are more than 14,000 soldiers in the Georgia National Guard and that the deployment “will not impact its ability to support the state in the event of an emergency,” but Bell said the Georgia’s National Guard should instead focus on local issues, such as helping those affected by recent storms and ensuring school safety rather than being deployed elsewhere.
“I think our National Guard needs to come home and to protect and not intimidate our students as they go to school, as they are witnesses to massacres across the nation, in the state, by right-leaning, conservative, typically MAGA-supporting individuals. We need our guards here, if anything,” Bell said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC0628-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 14:57:34.776119

(Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator) Black Louisiana state lawmakers want a state judge to force Attorney General Liz Murrill to resume defending the state’s congressional districts currently being challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus filed a writ Thursday with the 19th Judicial District Court that alleges Murrill is not upholding her constitutional duty to defend laws the legislature passes. She is instead arguing against the constitutionality of the congressional district map lawmakers approved last year in order to advance Republican political interests, according to the filing. 
The lawmakers ask the court to force Murrill to either resume defending the map or take no position. 
After previously defending the map, Murrill effectively switched sides and joined the white voters who challenged the constitutionality of the map once their case was scheduled for new arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“For purely political purposes, to assist efforts by the National Republican Party to maintain control of Congress in the 2026 mid-term elections, Attorney General Murrill has now flipped her position in the Supreme Court … and now on behalf of the State of Louisiana asserts [the map] is unconstitutional,” the Black Caucus’ petition reads. 
At issue is a new congressional map the Legislature adopted last year that includes two majority Black districts, including a new one that stretches from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing across the center of the state. The map is currently before the Supreme Court in the case Callais v. Louisiana, in which the white plaintiffs argue race determined the boundaries of the new 6th Congressional District.
The outcome could decide the future of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits election laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
“This pleading is so patently baseless it’s sanctionable,” Murrill said in a statement to the Illuminator. “Among other things, the state district court has no jurisdiction over the arguments the state attorney general makes in the United States Supreme Court on matters of federal law and the federal constitution.”

Officials from the state’s largest food banks said earlier this month that charities and other programs will have less food to feed longer lines of hungry people, especially with 40,000 New Mexicans expected to lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the new Congressional spending bill.
Vasquez warns Republican SNAP cuts will hit rural areas hardest

Rural programs will take a particularly big hit, employees from the Farmington-based nonprofit Economic Council on Helping Others Inc., said.
Nicknamed ECHO Inc., the group offers rental assistance and help with bills; operates a preschool; supplies back-to-school supplies for low-income families and feeds more than 7,000 households in Northeastern New Mexico through its food bank.
ECHO Inc. Associate Director Paula Gerthing said the food bank is the organization’s largest program, distributing nearly 2 million pounds of food in the last year for families. That includes 10,000 meals for kids and about 4,000 seniors.
Tami Jenkins, who directs the food bank, told lawmakers federal cuts earlier this spring amounted to just over $88,000, requiring the food bank to scramble to meet demand.
“That is 15,000 meals that we’ve had to somehow come up with and supplement what was expected to be there,” Jenkins said.
ECHO Inc. will lose 100% funding in fiscal year 2026 from a 90-year-old U.S. Department of Agriculture program used to purchase surplus eggs, milk and meat. In total, the end of the program will axe about $551,000 for ECHO Inc., amounting to a gap of 450,000 pounds of food.
Jenkins said that’s about seven months of food that will be lost.
“Once again, we’re gonna have to do fundraising and whatnot in order to fulfill that 450,000 pounds of food that we’re gonna miss,” she told lawmakers.
Additionally, the Trump Administration canceled $2.8 million in USDA funds for the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, a “very popular” program that helps farmers deliver regional produce to food banks, schools and senior centers, New Mexico Department of Agriculture Marketing and Development Director Jason New said.
New Mexico Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) requested Thursday’s speakers share their challenges with lawmakers during the upcoming special legislative session in October, with the hope of addressing the program losses sooner than next year’s regular session
“We know our food banks have been hit extremely hard,” Romero said. “I want to be sure that cuts to both NMDA and the recent federal legislation and discussion of some of the budget issues and those implications are considered for the special session going in.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-05 17:45:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,PSC moves toward placing Holly Springs utility  into receivership,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/05/psc-moves-toward-placing-holly-springs-utility-into-receivership/,The Mississippi PSC voted unanimously to ask a chancery judge to place the troubled Holly Springs Utility Department into the hands of a third party.,"NEW ALBANY — After five hours in a courtroom where attendees struggled to find standing room, the Mississippi Public Service Commission voted to petition a judge to put the Holly Springs Utility Department into a receivership.
The PSC held the hearing Thursday about a half hour drive west from Holly Springs in New Albany, known as “The Fair and Friendly City.” Throughout the proceedings, members of the PSC, its consultants and Holly Springs officials emphasized there was no precedent for what was going on.

The city of Holly Springs has provided electricity through a contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority since 1935. It serves about 12,000 customers, most of whom live outside the city limits. While current and past city officials say the utility’s issues are a result of financial negligence over many years, the service failures hit a boiling point during a 2023 ice storm where customers saw outages that lasted roughly two weeks as well as power surges that broke their appliances.
Those living in the service area say those issues still occur periodically, in addition to infrequent and inaccurate billing.
“I moved to Marshall County in 2020 as a place for retirement for my husband and I, and it’s been a nightmare for five years,” customer Monica Wright told the PSC at Thursday’s hearing. “We’ve replaced every electronic device we own, every appliance, our well pump and our septic pumps. It has financially broke us.
“We’re living on prayers and promises, and we need your help today.”

Another customer, Roscoe Sitgger of Michigan City, said he recently received a series of monthly bills between $500 and $600. 
Following a scathing July report by Silverpoint Consulting that found Holly Springs is “incapable” of running the utility, the three-member PSC voted unanimously on Thursday to determine the city isn’t providing “reasonably adequate service” to its customers. That language comes from a 2024 state bill that gave the commission authority to investigate the utility. 
The bill gives a pathway for temporarily removing the utility’s control from the city, allowing the PSC to petition a chancery judge to place the department into the hands of a third party. The PSC voted unanimously to do just that.

Thursday’s hearing gave the commission its first chance to direct official questions at Holly Springs representatives. Newly elected Mayor Charles Terry, utility General Manager Wayne Jones and City Attorney John Keith Perry fielded an array of criticism from the PSC. In his rebuttal, Perry suggested that any solution  — whether a receivership or selling the utility — would take time to implement, and requested 24 months for the city to make incremental improvements. Audience members shouted, “No!” as Perry spoke.
“We are in a crisis now,” responded Northern District Public Service Commissioner Chris Brown. “To try to turn the corner in incremental steps is going to be almost impossible.”

It’s unclear how much it would cost to fix the department’s long list of ailments. In 2023, TVPPA — a nonprofit that represents TVA’s local partners — estimated Holly Springs needs over $10 million just to restore its rights-of-way, and as much as $15 million to fix its substations. The department owes another $10 million in debt to TVA as well as its contractors, Brown said. 
“The city is holding back the growth of the county,” said Republican Sen. Neil Whaley of Potts Camp, who passionately criticized the Holly Springs officials sitting a few feet away. “You’ve got to do better, you’ve got to realize you’re holding these people hostage, and it’s not right and it’s not fair… They are being represented by people who do not care about them as long as the bill is paid.”
In determining next steps, Silverpoint Principal Stephanie Vavro told the PSC it may be hard to find someone willing to serve as receiver for the utility department, make significant investments and then hand the keys back to the city. The 2024 bill, Vavro said, doesn’t limit options to a receivership, and alternatives could include condemning the utility or finding a nearby utility to buy the service area.

Answering questions from Central District Public Service Commissioner De’Keither Stamps, Vavro said it’s unclear how much the department is worth, adding an engineer’s study would be needed to come up with a number. 
Terry, who reminded the PSC he’s only been Holly Springs’ mayor for just over 60 days, said there’s no way the city can afford the repair costs on its own. The city’s median income is about $47,000, roughly $8,000 less than the state’s as a whole.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04140235/3X0A7131.jpg,,,2025-09-05 13:57:51.528589

The ACLU of New Mexico alleges a DACA recipient is being held there “indefinitely.” (Photo by Santana Ochoa / Source NM)A 28-year-old father of four with longstanding legal deportation protections is being held in New Mexico’s largest immigration detention center without cause, according to a lawsuit filed recently in New Mexico federal court.
Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira has lived in the United States for most of his life and received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection, according to lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and Singleton Schreiber LLP, a private national firm with a New Mexico presence working with the ACLU. 
DACA is a status conferred through a 2012 federal law that affords immigrants who were brought to the United States as children protection from being deported for renewable two-year periods. 
Gamez Lira is a father of four and married to a United States citizen. According to the lawsuit, as well as surveillance video obtained by news outlet ElPasoYa, masked federal immigrant agents arrested him in his driveway in Horizon City, Texas, on Aug. 13 with two of his children in the car. The arrest resulted in a dislocated shoulder, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday names Homeland Security Kristi Noem and US Attorney General Pam Bondi, along with other federal officials and Dora Castro, the Otero County Processing Center warden. No defendant has yet responded in court. 
Earlier this summer, a spokesperson for DHS told NPR that DACA recipients “are not automatically protected from deportations” and that they should leave the United States voluntarily. 
Gamez Lira is being held at the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico, a facility that houses the majority of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees held in New Mexico. The ACLU alleges he faces “indefinite detention” at the facility, according to the news release. 
“Paulo has worked hard to build a dignified and meaningful life in the United States. He is a committed father of U.S. citizen children, and this is the only home he has ever known,” said ACLU-NM Senior Staff Attorney Becca Sheff in a statement. “It’s unconscionable for the government to hold Paulo indefinitely in an ICE detention center known for dangerous and degrading conditions, especially since his status as a DACA recipient protects him from being deported.”  
Emails provide new details on how NM lawmakers’ ICE lockup visit went off the rails

The lawyers filed a similar petition on behalf of Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago, another 28-year-old DACA recipient, who has been held in detention in West Texas for more than a month, according to the news release. The petitions allege the detainees are being held in violation of their constitutional rights to due process, along with other violations. 
A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on both cases.
The detention center where Gamez Lira is held has an average daily population of about 850 ICE detainees, according to the latest figures. A group of mostly Republican lawmakers visited the facility recently, part of an effort to push their Democratic colleagues and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham not to ban ICE detention facilities in New Mexico. 
The governor’s spokesperson told Source on Thursday evening in an email that potential legislation banning ICE detention facilities will not be on the agenda for a special session she scheduled for Oct. 1. However, it is among other topics that could be on the agenda for the 30-day session beginning early next year, according to the spokesperson.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSCF3975-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 13:57:51.528589

(Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator)The LSU Board of Supervisors has limited its power to influence faculty and staff hiring decisions after quietly giving themselves the ability last year. 
The board last year expanded its own bylaws to require its chair be made aware of “any search committees for new hires” and allows — but does not require — the chair to appoint members to the committees. The bylaws do not limit the chair’s number of appointees or require they have any specific qualifications. 
Search committees are used for nearly every faculty hire, as well as for deans, department chairs and administrators. Taken to its extreme, the new rule could allow the chair to stack any search committee and steer it to a preferred outcome. 
The board chair is hand-selected by the governor. After backlash from LSU faculty and staff, who raised concerns the new rules could introduce political influence to the hiring process, the board adopted rules that limit the scope of the new bylaws. 
The chair will still be made aware of all searches, but the new language limits the board’s ability to influence searches to high-level administrators, such as the president, chancellor, vice presidents and deans.

The company had already been investigating that possibility.","In summary
Federal prosecutors say faulty Edison equipment sparked the January wildfire that burned 8,000 acres. The company had already been investigating that possibility. 




The U.S. Department of Justice this week sued Southern California Edison, alleging the utility’s equipment caused the deadly Eaton Fire that swept through Los Angeles County in January. An official cause of the fire has not yet been released.
Its civil lawsuit is seeking reimbursement for the costs of containing the fire and rehabilitating 8,000 burned acres of Angeles National Forest. 
“SCE knew about the potential danger posed by the high wind event and the risks posed by power and transmission lines but failed to take action to prevent it from igniting a fire,” the lawsuit said.
Putting out the fire, the department said in the lawsuit, cost more than $40 million, and the damage will require substantial effort to rehabilitate.
As support for its claim that the fire was caused by utility equipment, the Justice Department cited public statements made by Pedro Pizarro, CEO of the utility’s parent company, including a January statement where Pizarro said that without more evidence, “we believe that SCE equipment could have been associated with the ignition.”
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Los Angeles County Fire Department are still investigating the official cause of the fire. But Edison has said its transmission lines at Eaton Canyon had an increase in electrical current when the fire began and that one idle line may have been reenergized. The Los Angeles Times reported that the utility changed its policy on how such structures are grounded after the fire. Before, grounding procedures were decided by engineers on a case by case basis; after, they were laid out based on the type of equipment and the material the equipment is made of. 
The Justice Department also filed a second lawsuit against the company over the 2022 Fairview fire, similarly asserting Southern California Edison was responsible. 
“We’re reviewing these lawsuits and we’ll respond through the appropriate legal channels,” Southern California Edison spokesperson Kathleen Dunleavy said. “Edison continues our work to reduce the likelihood of SCE’s equipment from starting a wildfire.”
The federal lawsuit comes weeks after Southern California Edison announced a voluntary program that will allow those affected by the fire to submit a claim for a more expedient payout in an effort to curb lawsuits, according to its website, many of which have already been filed against the utility. Victims of the fire saw this as a way to short larger payouts.
“The Justice Department’s lawsuits demonstrate Southern California Edison’s willingness to endanger California families through an unconscionable pattern of negligence,” Kiley Grombacher, co-founder of the California Fire Victims Law Center. “The pattern has cost lives, destroyed homes, and left entire communities contaminated",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/010825_Eaton-Power-Lines_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 13:57:51.528589

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s employment agency is spending $13 million for an online tool meant to act as “the world’s most knowledgeable guidance counselor” for high schoolers in the state.
The Department of Employment and Workforce will use the funds — $10.3 million in one-time money and $2.8 million in new annual dollars — to hire an outside contractor to build and maintain what the agency is calling an “Education and Workforce Portal.”

The tool is mandated by legislation passed in May 2023 that reshuffled oversight of the state’s workforce development efforts. The measure, spearheaded by state House Speaker Murrell Smith, moved workforce-related duties from the state’s economic development agency to the agency that aids unemployed workers.
The Sumter Republican’s office says, once the portal is operational, “South Carolinians will have a one-stop resource that connects education, training, and workforce needs in a way we’ve never had before.”
The online portal will have two main parts:

A section for K-12 schools and colleges to compare the curriculum they teach to what skills companies say they need workers to have
And a section for students and job seekers with information on in-demand occupations

What exactly that will look like remains to be seen. But the Department of Employment and Workforce has been testing out ideas on its Find Your Future website, said agency spokeswoman Mary Kate Olivas.
According to Smith’s office, the speaker envisions a place where students and their parents can log in and see exactly how much a certain college degree or certificate will cost, how long it will take to complete the degree, financial aid options to help pay for it, a list of job opportunities available in the area where they want to live and the salaries they can expect to make after graduation.
“Together, these tools help families make smarter decisions, help businesses find skilled workers, and keep more of our talent right here at home,” a statement from the speaker’s office read.
Here’s how many are graduating from SC colleges with in-demand degrees. It’s not enough.

“We must align educational offerings with employment opportunities, otherwise we’re wasting money and setting students up for failure by training them for jobs that don’t exist,” the statement continues. “This tool makes sure families see which programs actually lead to good jobs, and it helps schools adjust curricula to meet real employer needs.”
At the heart of the legislation passed two years ago is a push to increase the state’s labor force participation rate, which lags behind much of the nation.
South Carolina’s rate was 58.6% in July, compared to a national rate of 62.2%.
Labor force participation is the percentage of the population, age 16 and older, that is either working or actively seeking work. Because the calculation does not figure for those people who are retired, South Carolina’s heavy retiree population tends to hold down the state’s rate.
When only considering those people of prime employment age — age 25 to 54 — South Carolina’s rate is 81.1%, according to the latest available data. That’s 2.5 percentage points below the U.S. average.
Meanwhile, more South Carolinians are working now than ever before as the state’s population continues to grow. As of July, nearly 2.5 million people were estimated to be employed in the Palmetto State, according to state Employment and Workforce Executive Director William Floyd. That’s nearly 5,000 more people working compared to the month prior.
Still, more than 70,000 job openings are posted to the agency’s online database.

Among those openings are:

A senior software engineer with three years experience to work for an investment management company in Fort Mill, making $123,000 to $133,000 a year.
There’s a medical robotics company in Augusta seeking to hire a technician who can fix and train medical professionals on its robots, with a $85,000 annual salary.
A bank in Lexington is looking for a recruiter to work in its HR department, making $28,000 to $42,000 a year.
A Myrtle Beach engineering firm needs an electrical engineer and is offering a salary of $100,000 to $114,500.
An engineering firm in Greenville is offering $49,000 to $79,000 for a geologist.
A Charleston insurance company is looking for a salesperson, with a salary of $49,000 to $74,000 annually.

The Department of Employment and Workforce website also has data that could be useful to companies considering a South Carolina location, including the percentage of students from each high school who enrolled in college the fall following graduation and what those students chose to major in. 
Nearly 60% of all South Carolina public high school seniors went on to college after graduation between 2015 and 2022, although there were differences based on location. In Fort Mill, for instance, 78% went to college, while in Jasper County it was less than 33%.
The most popular area of study was healthcare, with more than 5,300 students seeking degrees in that field. Almost 5,000 students sought business degrees. About 2,000 went into education.
According to the speaker’s office, having all this information in one place rather than scattered among different agencies is what makes the proposed portal useful. But the portal alone isn’t enough to boost the state’s workforce.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Homelessness among Florida families rose by 28% in the last three years, a report from the University of Florida found. 
The 2025 Rental Market Study conducted by UF Shimberg Center for Housing Studies found that rent for multifamily units in Florida rose by 39% between 2019 and 2023, as 1 million households entered the state. 
“Florida’s strong population growth has collided with limited housing supply, pushing rents beyond what many families can afford,” said Anne Ray, manager of the Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse at the Shimberg Center.
According to the report, an estimated 904,000 renting households earn less than 60% of the median income and pay more than 40% of their income on housing.
“Florida’s not any different than most places and we saw the extreme rise in rents going back to the pandemic days and things have remained high as production pretty much came to a grinding halt for that period of time,” Florida Housing Coalition CEO Ashon Nesbitt told the Phoenix.
The state added more than 240,000 multifamily units between 2019 and 2023 while median rents rose by almost $500 per month, or 39%, from $1,238 to $1,719, the report found. 
Renting households include at least one employed adult in 79% of units. In households occupied by their owners, 67% are working.

“We’re still not producing as quickly as the need is overall,” Nesbitt said, adding that there’s a “great need” for rental options for people making below 80% of the median income. 
“Financially, it’s difficult to produce units at that level, and so with the lack of units affordable at that level, the overall lack of supplies, we have high rent costs, and the reduction in that supply is relating to that growth in those that are now becoming homeless,” Nesbitt said. 
The study found the largest inflow of residents to the state stretched from St. Johns County to Lee County.
Homelessness on the rise
The report, using Department of Housing and Urban Development and Florida Department of Education data, estimates 29,848 individuals in Florida are homeless, 6,049 of whom are unaccompanied youth.
The report estimates that 41,847 families are doubled up with others or staying in hotels and motels. 
The 2025 homelessness numbers represent a 14% increase for individuals and 28% increase for families since the 2022 report.

Nesbitt said that “down the line” there will be more supply as projects drawing on trust funds, the Live Local Act, land-use tools, and property tax exemptions are built. 
“When the units that are being produced aren’t necessarily matching where the greatest need is, that’s why we have this growing gap,” Nesbit said. 
As conversations ramp up about eliminating property taxes, Nesbitt said he expects people to consider how it will affect low- to-moderate-income homeowners and how it can be done equitably, based on income and other factors.  
“Many of the folks that are experiencing that instability are part of our workforce. Most of the folks that this [report] calls out, these are folks that are working jobs and working many of the jobs that power our state’s economy,” Nesbitt said. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that voters will be able to decide whether they want to pay property taxes or not during the 2026 election. He said his office is researching how it can be done.
“The demand for affordable housing is not new to most households in Florida. As inflation and cost of living continue to increase, the cost of housing and other necessary basic needs of individuals continue to be a financial challenge,” Florida TaxWatch CEO Dominic Calabro said in an update about the Live Local Act. 
The Live Local Act was a 2023 measure that gave tax breaks to developers creating multifamily residential properties for people making around or below the median income.
TaxWatch recommended the Legislature create tax credits for building homes affordable for “middle income” families, credits to adapt historic properties, and a low-income housing tax credit for rental properties to augment federal credits. 
The Florida Policy Institute advocated for restoration, too. 
“It is typically cheaper to rehabilitate a unit or building than to construct one from scratch. Including rehabilitation and improvement costs in the tax exemptions would increase and maintain the supply of affordable housing, and support climate resilience, respectively,” FPI said in a report released during the last legislative session.
A bill, SB 184, that would have required local governments to create local rules allowing accessory dwelling units, or granny flats, died this session.

(Photo courtesy of Golden campaign)A group of bipartisan representatives, including U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, introduced a bill late Thursday to extend health insurance subsidies through 2026. 
The legislation had been in the works prior but was announced the same day that Gov. Janet Mills asked Maine’s congressional delegation to extend the tax credit to insulate thousands of Mainers from steep increases in health insurance premiums next year.
Golden, a Democrat, is a co-sponsor of the Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act, introduced by Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, which would extend the credit by one year, past the 2026 midterms.
While not likely to be passed as a standalone measure, supporters are hoping that the backing of some moderate Republicans could increase the likelihood of the proposal being included in a potential continuing resolution to avoid a looming government shutdown. 
The enhanced premium tax credit, which is scheduled to expire at the end of the year, lowers the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. In Maine, about 61,000 people are enrolled through the state marketplace, CoverME.gov.
Mills calls on Congress to extend tax credit to help Mainers afford health insurance

The credit was established by the Affordable Care Act and then expanded twice, during the COVID-19 pandemic under the American Rescue Plan Act and then through the Inflation Reduction Act. Those laws were championed by Democrats with no Republican support. 
“Letting the ACA Enhanced Premium Tax Credits expire would raise costs on Maine families. That’s simply not an option,” Golden said in a statement Friday.
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson of Louisiana didn’t reject the idea of an extension, providing his first in-depth comments on the issue to Punchbowl News on Thursday. 
“I don’t think the policy is great,” Johnson said. “I don’t think we should be subsidizing high-income earners. It was a Covid-era issue, and so that’d be a big thing for the Republican Party to continue or advance that. At the same time, we don’t want anyone to be adversely affected by that.”
Thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the tax credits are not extended, Mills warned in her letter to Maine’s congressional delegation. 
Superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance Robert Carey attributed next year’s increased premium costs to the instability of federal policies, including the expiring credits and the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Other factors include the growing costs of medical services and prescription drugs.

Last year, the Michigan Department of Attorney General brought several charges against Bright Spark Strategies co-founder Heather Lombardini, following an investigation into an alleged dark money scheme in which two nonprofits – Michigan! My Michigan! and Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility – funneled $2.6 million into the Unlock Michigan campaign, which aimed to repeal the emergency powers Gov. Gretchen Whitmer utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lombardini faces three misdemeanor charges and a felony for allegedly failing to file campaign finance disclosures while acting as both the treasurer for Michigan! My Michigan! and president of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility. She is alleged to have encouraged wealthy business people and political funds tied to large businesses to donate to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility with the intention of moving that money to support Unlock Michigan’s signature gathering efforts.
Lombardini was one of two individuals charged as a result of the investigation, with the other, Sandy Baxter, accepting a plea deal from the attorney general’s office, which led to a sentence of three months of reporting probation, 20 hours of community service and a $2,500 fine.
Attorney General Dana Nessel announced charges related to Unlock Michigan, Feb. 21, 2024 | Anna Liz Nichols
Lombardini’s case is ongoing, with a pretrial conference scheduled for Sept. 17 in Lansing’s 30th District Court. 
Despite her pending criminal charges, Lombardini and her consulting firm remain a force in assisting political groups with fundraising and financial compliance matters.
Lombardini is listed as the sponsorship contact for the Michigan Republican Party’s upcoming leadership conference on Mackinac Island, and received praise from MIGOP Ethnic Vice Chairman Michael Farage for assisting with the party’s Kentucky Derby fundraiser. 
Neither Lombardini nor the party responded to a request for comment. 
According to campaign finance records, Lombardini serves as the treasurer on candidate committees for several elected officials in the state including state Rep. Curt VanderWall (R-Ludington), Nancy Jenkins-Arno (R-Clayton) Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) and University of Michigan Regent Sarah Hubbard.

She also previously served as a consultant on former State Rep. Andrew Fink’s (R-Adams Township) 2024 campaign for Michigan Supreme Court.
VanderWall, Jenkins-Arno, Hoadley, Borton and Hubbard did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Lombardini.
Lombardini also serves as the treasurer for several political action committees including funds tied to Michigan officeholders, including the VanderWall Majority Fund, Borton Leadership, McBroom for Michigan, Gina Majority Fund and Neyer Leadership Fund, linked to VanderWall, Borton, Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan), and Reps. Gina Johnsen (R-Odessa Township) and Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd).
While Neyer and Johnsen did not respond to a request for comment, McBroom offered his support for Lombardini calling her “one of the hardest working and most competent fundraisers in Lansing.”
“She has worked very hard for me and countless others to help us follow ridiculously convoluted and confusing campaign finance and non-profit laws. This case is not the first time our current [Secretary of State] has twisted those laws into new pretzels in order to harass her political opponents or help her friends,” McBroom said in an email. “It’s been transparent from the start the true target is not even Heather but former Republican leaders. Until a court says I can’t, I will proudly keep utilizing Heather’s good counsel and exceptional help.”
Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake), April 20, 2022 | Laina G. Stebbins
Former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) held ties to both Michigan! My Michigan! and Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, however he did not hold titles in either organization. Under these circumstances, Nessel told reporters while announcing the charges that the current laws didn’t warrant any charges against Shirkey.
The complaint which launched the investigation was brought by Robert LaBrant, an attorney and longtime former Republican government affairs strategist and consultant, and Mark Brewer, a campaign finance and election attorney at Goodman Acker who previously served as chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.
While Bright Spark Strategies is widely utilized by GOP candidates and causes, Lombardini has also been tapped by candidates and committees where she is not serving as the treasurer including candidate committees for Sen. Mark Huizenga (R-Walker) and Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen) and the Hauck Majority Fund, tied to State Sen. Roger Hauck (R-Mount Pleasant). 
Campaign finance records show Huizenga’s candidate committee paid Lombardini $95.20 for campaign travel and expenses for printing a sponsor board for a fundraising event on April 17. 
Roth’s candidate committee and the Hauck Majority Fund also reimbursed Lombardini for campaign mileage for events held earlier this year.
Huizenga, Hauck and Roth did not respond to a request for comment. 
Neil Thanedar, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, said it’s the responsibility of candidates to make sure the individuals they hire to help run their PACs and other committees are doing so ethically. 
“If the people who are doing the work to remain in compliance aren’t compliant themselves, that’s a big issue, right?” Thanedar said. 
Tommy Kubitschek, a spokesperson for the Michigan Democratic Party slammed Republicans for working with Lombardini in light of the charges filed against her. 
“Republicans at every level have made it clear that they are more than willing to work with criminals and will always put their own interests ahead of Michiganders. Any Republicans still working with Lombardini should find themselves a new fundraiser,” Kubitschek said in a statement.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump administration investigates Medicaid spending on immigrants in Democratic states,Associated Press and Angela Hart | KFF Health News,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/blue-state-medicaid-investigation-immigrants/,"Federal officials have sent letters to state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington.","The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn’t any waste, fraud or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press. While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services, such as prescription drugs and specialty care.
The federal agency told the states it is reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid’s fiscal integrity. California is the biggest target after the state self-reported overcharging the federal government for health care services delivered to immigrants without legal status, determined to be at least $500 million, spurring the threat of a lawsuit.
“If CMS determines that California is using federal money to pay for or subsidize healthcare for individuals without a satisfactory immigration status for which federal funding is prohibited by law,” according to a letter dated March 18, “CMS will diligently pursue all available enforcement strategies, including, consistent with applicable law, reductions in federal financial participation and possible referrals to the Attorney General of the United States for possible lawsuit against California.”
The investigations come as the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress slashed taxpayer spending on immigrant health care through cuts in President Donald Trump’s spending-and-tax law passed this summer. The administration is also pushing people living in the U.S. illegally off Medicaid rolls. Health policy experts say these moves could hamper care and leave safety net hospitals, clinics and other providers financially vulnerable. Some Democratic-led states — California, Illinois and Minnesota — have already had to end or slim down their Medicaid programs for immigrants due to ballooning costs. Colorado is also considering cuts due to cost overruns.
At the same time, 20 states are pushing back on Trump’s immigration crackdown by suing the administration for handing over Medicaid data on millions of enrollees to deportation officials. A federal judge temporarily halted the move. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who led that challenge, says the Trump administration is launching a political attack on states that embrace immigrants in Medicaid programs.
“The whole idea that there’s waste, fraud and abuse is contrived,” Bonta said. “It’s manufactured. It’s invented. It’s a catchall phrase that they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda.”
Trump administration targets immigrants
Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.
Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.
The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.
Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”
“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states. The oversight is intended to “ensure federal funds are reserved for legally eligible individuals, not for political experiments that violate the law,” she said.
Health policy researchers and economists say providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants for preventive services and treatment of chronic health conditions staves off more costly care for patients down the road. It also tamps down insurance premium increases and the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.
Francisco Silva, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association, said the Trump administration is threatening to drive up health care costs and make it more difficult to access care.
“The impact is emergency rooms would get so crowded that ambulances have to be diverted away and people in a real emergency can’t get into the hospital, and public health threats like disease outbreaks,” Silva said.
California has taken a health-care-for-all approach, providing coverage to 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. The expansion, which was rolled out from 2016 to 2024, is estimated to cost $12.4 billion this year. Of that, $1.3 billion is paid by the federal government for emergency and pregnancy-related care.
As California rolled out its expansion, the state erroneously billed the federal government for care provided to immigrants without legal status — details that have not previously been reported and that former state officials shared with KFF Health News and the AP. The state improperly billed for services such as mental health and addiction services, prescription drugs and dental care.
Jacey Cooper, who served as California’s Medicaid director from 2020 to 2023, said she discovered the error and reported it to federal regulators. Cooper said the state had been working to pay back at least $500 million identified by the federal government.
“Once I identified the problem, I thought it was really important to report it and we did,” Cooper said. “We take waste, fraud and abuse very seriously.”
It’s not clear whether that money has been repaid. The state’s Medicaid agency says it does not know how CMS calculated the overpayments or “what is included in that amount, what time period it covers, and if or when it was collected,” said spokesperson Tony Cava.
California has an enormously complicated Medicaid program: It serves the largest population in the nation — nearly 15 million people — with a budget of nearly $200 billion this fiscal year.
Matt Salo, a national Medicaid expert, said these types of mistakes happen in states throughout the country because the program is rife with overlapping federal and state rules. Salo and other policy analysts agreed that states have the authority to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit and root out misuse of federal funds.
And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Trump administration’s actions “persecute a minority that’s unpopular with the powers that be.”
“The Trump administration cannot maintain that this effort has anything to do with maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program,” Cannon said. “There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.”
Immigrants’ Medicaid under attack
National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.
The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.
“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”
States under review say they are following the law.
“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.
Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.
Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.
“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

Jeff Landry delivers his address to state lawmakers on opening day of the regular legislative session, Monday, March 11, 2024, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (John Ballance/The Advocate, Pool)The Louisiana Board of Ethics on Friday dropped formal charges against Gov. Jeff Landry for failing to disclose flights he took on a political donor’s private plane while he was attorney general. 

Instead, Landry agreed to admit publicly to six instances in which he failed to disclose roundtrip travel he took on political donors’ private planes and helicopters as attorney general. The board also fined the governor $900, though Landry could have faced tens of thousands of dollars of fines for failing to disclose the complementary travel. (Read the consent opinion below)
The Illuminator has reached out to the governor’s office for comment.
In a separate but related decision, the board also told Landry that he must report when and where he accepts free travel and lodging as governor, though his attorneys had suggested it shouldn’t be a requirement.
As attorney general, Landry accepted flights to and from Hawaii in June 2021 from Station Aviation, a company owned by retired oil and gas businessman Greg Mosing. Landry traveled to the Attorney General Alliance conference, where he was a featured speaker, at the Grand Wailea Maui, a luxury beachfront resort.

The ethics board used the Hawaii flights as the basis of the charges they filed against Landry in 2023 and dropped this week. Until Friday, it wasn’t publicly known that the ethics board and Landry were in discussions about disclosing five other flights on aircraft that had been provided by donors. 
Lawyers for Landry had sought an advisory opinion from the ethics board as to whether he must report any complimentary travel and lodging he accepts as governor. Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies, who represented Landry before the ethics board, suggested Landry shouldn’t have to fill out the required forms because he is the “head of the agency” who obviously approves his own travel.
State ethics administrator David Bordelon said he has provided guidance to the governor and other state agency heads to clarify instructions on the forms. 
Louisiana’s ethics code prohibits elected officials and state employees from accepting anything of value as a gift if the giver has “substantial economic interests” over which the public employee has influence. The forms are required to verify there is no conflict of interest when an official accepts a gift.  
The decision to drop the charges against Landry was made in conjunction with the new guidance on travel disclosure forms, Bordelon told board members. It ends more than two years of deliberations with Landry’s attorneys since the charges were filed.
There’s additional significance in Friday’s decision as it comes from an ethics board that now consists of members the governor and Republican-led legislature have appointed directly. They voted last year to expand the board from 11 to 15 members, which allowed Landry and lawmakers to seat seven new members. Previously, the governor and legislators had to pick ethics board members from a list of recommendations leaders of private Louisiana universities submitted.

Read this story in English.
Los niños de Connecticut ya han vuelto a la escuela y a primera vista, el gobierno estatal está realizando una inversión sin precedentes en su educación este año.
Sin embargo, si bien la subvención de Costos Compartidos para la Educación (ECS), la fórmula que representa la principal asistencia operativa del estado para los distritos escolares locales, destinará casi $2.5 mil millones a los distritos locales este año fiscal, más del 10% del Fondo General, los críticos afirman que el programa ha ido a la zaga de la inflación durante años, lo que ha agravado las enormes disparidades en la financiación escolar entre las comunidades ricas y pobres.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre un problema que ha desconcertado a legisladores, gobernadores y tribunales durante décadas.
¿Cómo funciona la fórmula ECS?
Si bien nunca ha logrado la paridad en la financiación escolar, la fórmula ECS está diseñada para acercar a Connecticut a la igualdad.
Y comienza con un nivel básico, asumiendo que educar a un estudiante en Connecticut cuesta aproximadamente $11,525.
A partir de ahí, la fórmula ajusta el gasto por alumno en función de la cantidad de estudiantes que un distrito atiende provenientes de hogares de bajos ingresos. Se centra especialmente en los alumnos que pueden recibir comidas gratuitas o a precio reducido o que hablan inglés como segundo idioma.
También considera la riqueza de una ciudad o pueblo de dos maneras: el valor de sus propiedades imponibles y los ingresos de sus residentes.
Con la esperanza de fomentar la cooperación y el ahorro por eficiencia, el estado también ofrece una bonificación a los pueblos que envían estudiantes a distritos escolares regionales.
¿Ha tenido siempre el estado la fórmula ECS?
Históricamente, Connecticut dejó que las ciudades y pueblos dependieran principalmente de los contribuyentes locales para financiar la educación primaria y secundaria. Y si bien el estado desarrolló algunas de las comunidades más ricas y algunas de las más pobres del país, su enfoque en la financiación escolar se mantuvo inalterado.
Sin embargo, la Corte Suprema de Connecticut, en su fallo histórico de 1977 en el caso Horton contra Meskill, determinó que un sistema de financiación disfuncional violaba el derecho a la educación garantizado en la Constitución estatal. Sin embargo, los jueces también concluyeron que crear un enfoque más equitativo era tarea de la legislatura.
Anticipándose a este fallo, la legislatura había actuado en 1975 para crear el primer sistema ponderado de subvenciones estatales, la fórmula de Base Imponible Garantizada (GTB). Este sistema se modificó para convertirse en el sistema de Costos Compartidos de Educación en 1988, cuando los legisladores fusionaron este programa con un esfuerzo continuo por aumentar los salarios de los docentes en todo el estado.
Ni la legislación de la GTB ni la del ECS garantizan que todos los distritos gocen de la misma financiación, mediante una combinación de fondos provenientes de impuestos locales sobre la propiedad y el aumento de las subvenciones estatales. Y Connecticut nunca ha logrado tal paridad.
¿Qué factores han afectado a la fórmula del ECS?
La deuda de pensiones de Connecticut a menudo ha obstaculizado la financiación equitativa de la educación.
Los gobernadores y las legislaturas desde finales de la década de 1930, no ahorraron lo suficiente para estas prestaciones, lo que dejó al estado con una deuda de miles de millones de dólares. Para la década de 1990, las contribuciones obligatorias a las pensiones comenzaron a aumentar significativamente, absorbiendo recursos que podrían haberse destinado a la educación y otros programas.
Esto no se estabilizó hasta 2017, cuando las autoridades comenzaron a refinanciar la deuda de pensiones, extendiendo los planes de pago y traspasando parte de la deuda a las futuras generaciones de contribuyentes.
Los legisladores tomaron otras dos medidas clave ese mismo año: crear nuevos límites presupuestarios para aumentar los superávits, que se utilizarían para pagar la deuda de pensiones aún más rápido; y ordenar un plan plurianual para reforzar el ECS.
Pero las pensiones recibieron una porción mucho mayor del pastel presupuestario.
Desde 2017, los superávits han promediado más de 1,800 millones de dólares al año. El programa ECS ha aumentado unos 450 millones de dólares con respecto a hace ocho años, y los críticos afirman que el crecimiento es demasiado modesto para compensar décadas de estancamiento en la financiación.
¿Ha seguido la fórmula del ECS el ritmo de la inflación?
No.
El Proyecto de Financiamiento Escolar y Estatal, un grupo de políticas educativas con sede en Connecticut, estima que el sistema ECS distribuiría $99 millones adicionales este año fiscal si solo el nivel básico se ajustara para reflejar la inflación.
La Conferencia de Municipios de Connecticut (CCM) lanzó una campaña publicitaria en marzo atacando al Gobernador Ned Lamont, un gran defensor de los programas de ahorro existentes. La CCM estima que las subvenciones del ECS, ajustadas a la inflación, han disminuido en más de $400 millones desde que Lamont asumió el cargo en 2019.
“Se les pide a los líderes locales que hagan más con menos, y los líderes estatales deben ser honestos sobre los desafíos que enfrentan nuestras comunidades”, declaró Joe DeLong, director ejecutivo y CEO de la CCM. “Es hora de soluciones reales que proporcionen financiación estable, predecible y suficiente para nuestras ciudades y pueblos, no solo temas de debate político”.
Lamont replicó que ha intentado aumentar la ayuda a la educación y al gobierno general para los municipios, mientras que al mismo tiempo reduce decenas de miles de millones de dólares en deuda de pensiones que heredó.
“Mis presupuestos priorizaron importantes inversiones en ayuda municipal porque esa financiación va más allá de garantizar que nuestras ciudades únicas sean lugares increíbles para vivir, sino porque apoya la educación de nuestros hijos y les brinda la mejor oportunidad desde el comienzo de su vida”, declaró Lamont en marzo.
¿Qué es la ‘exención de responsabilidad’ y cómo afecta al ECS?
Y mientras los funcionarios estatales intentan equilibrar la ayuda municipal y las obligaciones de pensiones, un tercer problema también oscurece el futuro del programa ECS.
¿Tendrá Connecticut que empezar a recortar las becas educativas de algunas comunidades para aumentar las de otras?
Durante décadas, legisladores y gobernadores se han resistido en gran medida a esta opción, incluso si la fórmula del ECS exigía que un distrito sufriera un recorte debido a su gran riqueza, la disminución de la matrícula estudiantil o una combinación de factores.
Este enfoque de “exención de responsabilidad” — garantizar que ningún distrito recibiera menos fondos estatales en el año que el anterior — se puso a prueba la primavera pasada.
Lamont recomendó que los legisladores mantuvieran la fórmula adoptada, aumentando el programa en más de $80 millones en 2025-26, pero permitiendo que más de 80 comunidades recibieran menos fondos y, en conjunto, perdieran poco menos de $10 millones.
Sin embargo, la Senadora Estatal Cathy Osten, Demócrata por Sprague y copresidenta del Comité de Asignaciones, pidió a los legisladores que mantuvieran la “exención de responsabilidad” por ahora, argumentando que la fórmula del ECS es defectuosa y, de lo contrario, perjudicaría a muchos pueblos rurales pobres de su distrito en el condado de New London.
Muchas comunidades rurales pobres, caracterizadas por un alto desempleo, un alto número de casos de asistencia pública y tasas de impuestos locales sobre la propiedad, tienen una población estudiantil en declive. Sin embargo, señaló Osten, la mayoría son de tamaño mediano a grande geográficamente. Esto significa que, incluso si sus escuelas pierden algunos estudiantes, no pueden reducir costos fácilmente fusionando clases o cerrando escuelas.
“Eso significa que esas comunidades no cuentan”, dijo Osten.
Los legisladores finalmente optaron por salvar a esos más de 80 distritos de los recortes del ECS durante otros dos años fiscales, pero se espera que reanuden pronto el debate sobre la “exención de responsabilidad”.

,DC,2025-09-05 15:43:51+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump campaigned on closing the Education Department. Reality is more difficult.,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-campaigned-closing-education-department-reality-more-difficult,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s aim to shutter the Education Department faces steep hurdles in Congress, where Republicans’ legislative efforts to abolish the agency remain stalled and appropriators have rejected many of his proposed cuts to education spending.After campaigning last year on a pledge to shut down the department, Trump came into office promising to follow through, and made some preliminary moves.He said he wanted Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job” and signed a sweeping executive order in March calling on her to facilitate the closure of the Education Department to the extent she is permitted to by law.He won a key victory in the U.S. Supreme Court in July that temporarily cleared the way for the administration to move ahead with mass layoffs at the agency, a plan to dramatically downsize the department outlined in that March executive order and his directive to transfer certain services to other agencies. Court documents show that the department is planning to bring back more than 260 Office for Civil Rights staff affected by those sweeping layoffs stemming from a separate legal challenge against the administration’s actions earlier this year. But after a dizzying array of cuts and changes in the months since Trump took office looking to dismantle the agency, the GOP-controlled Congress — the only body that can abolish the 45-year-old department it created — is throwing up roadblocks to elimination.Bills stalledFor starters, the handful of GOP bills in Congress to close down the department face a difficult path in the Senate, which requires at least 60 senators to advance most legislation. Republicans hold just 53 Senate seats. In the House, at least four Republicans — Thomas Massie of Kentucky, David Rouzer of North Carolina, Barry Moore of Alabama and Nathaniel Moran of Texas — have introduced bills this year to eliminate the department. Those bills were referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, which has not voted on any of them. In a brief interview at the Capitol on Sept. 3, the committee’s chair, Michigan Republican Tim Walberg, said he still intended to eventually dismantle the agency, but had not committed to any particular bill.“Our intentions are to ultimately dissolve the Department of Education — we know we have to do that in a way that makes sense and so, we’ll take a look at all bills,” Walberg told States Newsroom. “I can’t say whether they will all come up or not, but we know that, working with the secretary of Education, we’re going to right-size it, and some things we’ll eliminate, other things we’ll shift, as we’ve done already, over to the Department of Labor to take on some workforce areas,” the Michigan Republican said. The chair acknowledged that there would not be enough votes in the Senate to abolish the agency. “So what we can do that seems right for our students, for our parents and for our teachers, we’ll do,” Walberg said. GOP efforts to dismantle the department are also underway in the Senate. Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, alongside Sens. Jim Banks of Indiana and Tim Sheehy of Montana, reintroduced a measure in April to abolish the agency. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul also reintroduced a bill in March with Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Bernie Moreno of Ohio to shutter the department. The measure is a companion bill to Massie’s legislation. A spokesperson for Sen. Bill Cassidy, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said the Louisiana Republican is “working with the administration and colleagues on how Congress can best codify the President’s reforms into law,” in a statement to States Newsroom.The spokesperson noted that “President Trump and Republicans are committed to returning education authority to local communities best equipped to meet the needs of students and families.” Senate rebuffs Trump spending cutsThe administration’s attempts to dramatically scale back funding for the department in fiscal 2026 have not been met with much enthusiasm by appropriators in the Senate. The House and Senate Appropriations committees share jurisdiction over the bill to fund the department for the coming fiscal year. The Senate committee advanced a bipartisan bill in July, which largely rejects Trump’s proposed cuts to education spending and his attempt to dismantle the department. The bill tightens requirements for the department to have the necessary staffing levels to fulfill its statutory responsibilities and prevents the agency from transferring certain programs to other federal agencies. The legislation also allocates $79 billion in discretionary funding for the coming fiscal year, roughly the same as the current level, which could be seen as a slap in the face to the administration’s budget request that called for $12 billion in spending cuts at the agency. House includes deep cuts but keeps Pell spendingMeanwhile, the House Appropriations subcommittee dealing with education spending advanced its spending proposal for the agency on Sept. 2, sending the bill to the broader panel. The bill aligns much more with the administration’s spending cut priorities and education agenda, calling for $67 billion in discretionary funding at the department.Part of the bill also reduces funding for Title I grants — which support school districts with high percentages of students who come from low-income families — by $5.2 billion, according to a summary from committee Republicans. The majority notes that “despite outsized investment, America’s public schools continue to fail children and families.”But spending proposals in both the House and Senate reject the administration’s request to significantly reduce the maximum award for the Pell Grant, a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college. Instead, each proposal maintains the maximum award at $7,395. House and Senate appropriators have several steps to go before they can even reach the negotiating phase on the bill — which also includes spending on other agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services — and get it closer to becoming law.It’s possible there might not even be a final agreement for months as lawmakers struggle to come to an overall agreement on how much to spend in the coming fiscal year, but the Senate’s bipartisan plan might give that chamber more of an advantage if those negotiations take place.",,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514
,California,2025-09-05 15:36:54+00:00,CalMatters,Breakthrough on California housing could put taller buildings in single-family neighborhoods,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/09/california-housing-near-transit/,A powerful California construction union is no longer fighting a bill that would ease barriers to the construction of tall apartment buildings near train and bus stations.,"In summary
A powerful California construction union is no longer fighting a bill that would ease barriers to the construction of tall apartment buildings near train and bus stations.


A controversial housing bill that would pave the way for more apartment buildings near major bus stops and train and subway stations across urban California is one step closer to becoming law after its author struck a last-minute deal with a long-time political foe, one of the state’s most powerful labor groups. 
The State Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents union construction workers, agreed to drop its opposition to Senate Bill 79 in exchange for an amendment that would require some of the projects that make use of the bill to hire union workers. 
The bill, authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, would be one of the largest state-imposed housing densification efforts in recent memory. On residential and commercial lots within a walkable half-mile of well-trafficked public transit stops, developers would be allowed to build taller and denser housing — as high as six stories. That would apply in neighborhoods where local regulations restrict new development to single-family homes. 
Wiener and backers of the bill argue that the state needs to turbo-charge housing construction to bring down the cost of living in California and that local zoning restrictions are among the barriers to that necessary building boom.
“This is exactly where we should be building more housing, right by our highest quality transit,” Wiener said.
Since Wiener rolled out the bill in March it has become a magnet of controversy. SB 79 only squeaked out of the Senate, clearing the opposition of two powerful Democratic committee chairs on its way, who largely objected to the fact that the bill did not include larger affordable housing requirements. The trades’ decision to withdraw from the fight significantly boosts the bill’s chances of becoming law.
“You hear from legislators all the time trying to be on the same side as the housing folks and the same side of labor — they don’t like when those sides are split,” said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist with the Bay Area Council, a business group that is backing the bill. “The trades removing their opposition is always helpful when you’re trying to pass a housing bill. That’s pretty cut and dry.”
Backed by “Yes in my backyard” activists, economic development boosters and public transit advocates, the bill has been fiercely opposed by neighborhood preservation groups, critics of market-rate development and a long list of local governments — including most recently, Los Angeles — who argue that the bill tramples on local prerogatives over what gets built and where.
Throughout that legislative gauntlet, the Trades Council have also been opposed. Not anymore.
“My hope is that this can be the beginning of shifting the dynamic where we’re all locking arms,” said Wiener. “We all want more housing. We all want more construction workers to be part of the middle class and not in poverty.”
Wiener, California YIMBY founder Brian Hanlon and Trades Council president Chris Hannan announced a deal on Friday morning. 
Under the terms of the deal, projects over 85-feet tall would be required to hire “skilled and trained” workers — effectively a hire-union requirement — if the developer receives a sufficient number of bids. Projects built on transit agency-owned land would likewise need to meet that requirement or enter into a direct contract with labor unions.
Over the last decade, the trades council has developed a reputation as a particularly well-organized and unyielding opponent of bills that ease restrictions on residential construction unless they also include broad minimum pay levels or union hiring requirements. The amendments announced today represent a step back from that all-or-nothing position. Most projects over 85 feet, for example, use concrete and steel frame construction, which require a higher skilled labor force that is often unionized anyway. 
This isn’t the first time this year that the trades have been willing to take less than a full victory in exchange for dropping their opposition to a bill. When the Legislature was debating a proposal to exempt most new urban multifamily housing from the state’s premier environmental protection law, the trades accepted a concession that provided wage and hiring requirements for a small subset of projects.
The fact that California YIMBY and the trades council were in direct communication Could itself represent a notable political shift in the way that housing bills are negotiated in the capitol.
“Chris (Hannan) and I really have been spending a lot of time on this bill to the point where, quite frankly, some members of my coalition thought I was chasing at windmills,” said Hanlon of California YIMBY. “This bill here represents not just a deal on the specific language of SB 79, but it’s also a commitment from me and Chris to work together in the coming years to pass legislation to create more homebuilding opportunities in California.”
SB 79 still needs to be voted on by the entire Assembly and then once again by the Senate before the end-of-session Sept. 12 legislative deadline. If Gov. Gavin Newsom then signs it, it would be a particular feat for Wiener, who has tried and failed to pass similar legislation twice before. 
“The bill is not guaranteed to pass, but we have more momentum today than we did yesterday,” said Wiener.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/052423-Santa-Monica-Construction-ZS-CM-21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The gender gap in math widened in the pandemic,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/gender-gap-stem-pandemic/,Efforts to close the gender gap in STEM education are gaining momentum after setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School in Irving, Texas, puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.
The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.
“Oh! Oh, it reacts differently to different colors,” said sixth grader Sofia Cruz.
In de Zavala’s first year as a choice school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, the school recruited a sixth grade class that’s half girls. School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala’s higher grades — whose students joined before it was a STEM school — some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.
Efforts to close the gap between boys and girls in STEM classes are picking up after losing steam nationwide during the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools have extensive work ahead to make up for the ground girls lost, in both interest and performance.
In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap nearly closed. But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys’ scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.
As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed — and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.
Old practices and biases likely reemerged during the pandemic, said Michelle Stie, a vice president at the National Math and Science Initiative.
“Let’s just call it what it is,” Stie said. “When society is disrupted, you fall back into bad patterns.”
The pandemic upended progress toward closing the gender gap
In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP’s analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.
A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.
Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.
A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.
Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.
“It wasn’t something like COVID happened and girls just fell apart,” said Megan Kuhfeld, one of the authors of the NWEA study.
Initiatives to boost girls’ confidence in STEM lost traction
In the years leading up to the pandemic, teaching practices shifted to deemphasize speed, competition and rote memorization. Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.
Educators also promoted participation in STEM subjects and programs that boosted girls’ confidence, including extracurriculars that emphasized hands-on learning and connected abstract concepts to real-life applications.
When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City. Girls were significantly more engaged after the district moved some of its introductory hands-on STEM curriculum to the lower grade levels and balanced classes by gender, he said.
When schools closed for the pandemic, the district had to focus on making remote learning work. When in-person classes resumed, some of the teachers had left, and new ones had to be trained in the curriculum, Rodrequez said.
“Whenever there’s crisis, we go back to what we knew,” Rodrequez said.
Bias against girls in STEM persists
Despite shifts in societal perceptions, a bias against girls persists in science and math subjects, according to teachers, administrators and advocates. It becomes a message girls can internalize about their own abilities, they say, even at a very young age.
In his third grade classroom in Washington, D.C., teacher Raphael Bonhomme starts the year with an exercise where students break down what makes up their identity. Rarely do the girls describe themselves as good at math. Already, some say they are “not a math person.”
“I’m like, you’re 8 years old,” he said. “What are you talking about, ‘I’m not a math person?’”
Girls also may have been more sensitive to changes in instructional methods spurred by the pandemic, said Janine Remillard, a math education professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Research has found girls tend to prefer learning things that are connected to real-life examples, while boys generally do better in a competitive environment.
“What teachers told me during COVID is the first thing to go were all of these sense-making processes,” she said.
A school district renews its commitment
At de Zavala Middle School in Irving, the STEM program is part of a push that aims to build curiosity, resilience and problem-solving across subjects.
Coming out of the pandemic, Irving schools had to make a renewed investment in training for teachers, said Erin O’Connor, a STEM and innovation specialist there.
The district last year also piloted a new science curriculum from Lego Education. The lesson involving the machine at de Zavala, for example, had students learn about kinetic energy. Fifth graders learned about genetics by building dinosaurs and their offspring with Lego blocks, identifying shared traits.
“It is just rebuilding the culture of, we want to build critical thinkers and problem solvers,” O’Connor said.
Teacher Tenisha Willis recently led second graders at Irving’s Townley Elementary School through building a machine that would push blocks into a container. She knelt next to three girls who were struggling.
They tried to add a plank to the wheeled body of the machine, but the blocks didn’t move enough. One girl grew frustrated, but Willis was patient. She asked what else they could try, whether they could flip some parts around. The girls ran the machine again. This time, it worked.
“Sometimes we can’t give up,” Willis said. “Sometimes we already have a solution. We just have to adjust it a little bit.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25234138668131-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)In a win for unions, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a lawsuit this week challenging Minnesota’s ban on mandatory anti-union meetings.
The ban, which passed as part of a sweeping pro-labor agenda in 2023, was long sought by union leaders who argue captive audience meetings give employers an unfair advantage in organizing campaigns.
“All working people should have the freedom to choose whether to form a union at their workplace without interference or intimidation from their employer,” said Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham in a statement celebrating Wednesday’s ruling.
Two non-union contractor associations — the Minnesota Chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors and the National Federation of Independent Business — and Laketown Electric Corporation challenged the ban, arguing in a lawsuit filed in federal court  last year that it violates employers’ First Amendment right to free speech and contradicted the National Labor Relations Act.
The state hadn’t tried to enforce the ban, but the contractors argued the law created a “chilling effect “that prevented them from exercising their constitutional rights. In the lawsuit, Laketown Electric said it was one of the fastest growing companies in Minnesota, and “is frequently targeted by union organizing efforts, creating the need to communicate lawfully with its employees on this important topic.”
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Department of Labor and Industry Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach, named as defendants in the suit, moved to dismiss the lawsuit arguing they didn’t have sufficient connection to the ban to be sued over it.
The law largely leaves enforcement to employees, who have the power to sue their bosses if they are forced to attend captive audience meetings. Blissenbach and Ellison said they never threatened to enforce the ban and had no “present intention” to.
Gov. Tim Walz was later added as a defendant after he told a packed ballroom at the North America’s Building Trades Unions conference that, “Those captive, anti-union meetings … You go to jail now if you do that in Minnesota because you can’t intimidate people.”
No one can be jailed for violating the ban, and asked about the comment, Walz’s spokeswoman replied he “was just emphasizing a point about a law we passed.”
A Minnesota district court judge allowed the lawsuit to proceed in part based on that statement, finding that it contradicted Ellison’s statement that he had no intent to enforce the ban.
In a 2-1 ruling, Appeals Court Judges Jonathan Kobes and Ralph Erickson ruled that Ellison, Blissenbach and Walz were not sufficiently connected to enforcement action to bring a lawsuit because Blissenbach and Walz cannot enforce the ban and Ellison had no intention to.
Ellison called the ruling a “win for working people” in a statement reminding employees that they have the right to refuse to attend anti-union meetings.
Minnesota Chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors President Adam Hanson said he is disappointed in the ruling and considering an appeal.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P1229848-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Fresh off a court victory ordering the “Alligator Alcatraz” migrant detention center to remain open, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Baker County’s “Deportation Depot” is in operation.
“Deportation Depot,” a DeSantis-coined moniker, occupies the old Baker County Correctional Facility north of Gainesville. The center can hold up to 2,000 people and opened Tuesday, the governor’s office confirmed to The Florida Phoenix.
It’s “receiving” migrants as of Friday.
“We’re not only doing Alligator Alcatraz, we’ve now opened the Deportation Depot up in Northeast Florida, and we’re working on opening a Panhandle Pokey in northwest Florida,” DeSantis said Thursday night on FOX News.
The announcement came hours after a federal appeals court sided with DeSantis by pausing a lower judge’s order that would have dismantled the Everglades facility and blocked it from receiving more migrants by September’s end.
The 2-to-1 decision by the Atlanta-based court was a massive victory for DeSantis and top GOP leaders, who had touted the first-in-the-nation center as a powerful buttress in President Donald Trump’s sweeping anti-undocumented immigration agenda.
DeSantis first announced plans for “Deportation Depot” in mid-August, a month and half after the Everglades facility hosted Trump and other top federal authorities for a grand opening event.
The new center’s opening comes weeks after The Associated Press first reported that Alligator Alcatraz, located firmly within the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, was nearly empty. Molly Best, a spokesperson for the governor, said that added migrant facilities in different Florida regions facilitates quicker deportations.
The “Panhandle Pokey” is a third center planned by the state government in western Florida. DeSantis has yet to select a location or timeframe for it’s opening.
“You know, you’re in the Panhandle sending to Alligator Alcatraz, that’s a long way. Even sending to the Deportation Depot in North Florida, that could be three to five hours depending on where you are in the Panhandle,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier this week.

Throughout my career in the Marine Corps, logistics has always underpinned every operation — from training exercises to overseas combat tours to planning for future conflicts. Weapons, material, fuel and other supplies that our troops rely upon are delivered across thousands of miles of ocean, principally by ship.
I can assure you, the 70-ton M1A1 tanks I commanded in Fallujah in 2007-08 did not arrive by cargo plane. These vital war supplies, along with troop transport, are delivered by the U.S. Merchant Marine.
Not to be confused with the Marine Corps of which I served, the Merchant Marine is composed of civilian mariners and both commercial and federal-owned ships. In peacetime, the Merchant Marine carries domestic and international cargo. During conflict, the mariners become a critical component of the military logistics system. Unfortunately, the Merchant Marine is facing mounting challenges that threaten its ability to fulfill this role.
Maritime commerce plays an essential role in the global economy and the economic security of the United States.
Compared to China, our principal maritime competitor, the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet is smaller and is rapidly aging beyond its service limits. Compounding this issue is a dwindling number of shipyards, a shrinking shipbuilding workforce and a significant shortfall of qualified civilian mariners. This erosion poses a direct threat to the readiness and resilience of our defense and commercial supply chains.

The University of Southern Mississippi, however, is uniquely positioned to help address this challenge. With a strong affiliation with the maritime industry, the proximity of its Gulf Coast campus to naval bases, and the state’s only ocean engineering program, USM could take a transformative step by establishing the Mississippi Maritime Academy.
Civilian mariners are vital to the nation’s sealift capacity, which ensures the rapid transportation of military and humanitarian supplies during crises. The Merchant Marine also supports global commerce, with roughly 90% of world trade moving by sea. However, the U.S. pool of licensed mariners is aging, with many nearing retirements, and the recruitment pipeline is not keeping pace.
The Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the Department of Defense have repeatedly warned of this national security risk.
In response, MARAD published its “Mariner Workforce Strategic Plan” in 2023 (revised in 2025) and has designated 32 Centers of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce Training and Education to help prepare students for various roles in the maritime industry. Notably, two of the inaugural centers are Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College and Hinds Community College — evidence that Mississippi is already contributing to maritime workforce development.
Currently, new merchant marine officers are sourced through the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, as well as six state maritime academies in Texas, California, Michigan, Maine, Massachusetts and New York. These state academies receive limited federal assistance through the Navy-sponsored Strategic Sealift Midshipman Program (SSMP), as well as training vessels to support their unique licensing and curriculum requirements. Similar to the traditional Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), the SSMP is tailored to develop a cadre of officers to operate merchant ships as naval auxiliaries and are commissioned as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Navy Reserve.
Yet even these combined efforts are not enough to meet the nation’s mariner needs. This poses a risk not only to the commercial sector, but to the Merchant Marine role as a military logistics reserve in conflict.
USM’s Gulf Coast campus offers a compelling solution. Its marine and ocean engineering programs provide a technical foundation that aligns perfectly with the needs of the maritime industry. Additionally, its proximity to key Gulf Coast naval installations, such as Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport and Naval Air Station Pensacola, presents opportunities for collaboration with the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard.
Furthermore, the Gulf Coast region supports a robust maritime industry, including shipbuilding, port operations and offshore energy. According to the Mississippi Development Authority, the maritime industries represent 22% of the local workforce in Mississippi’s coastal counties. Collaborations with these industries could enhance practical training opportunities for midshipmen.
This proposal is not without historical precedent. During World War II, the Merchant Marine Cadet Corps trained thousands of mariners at Pass Christian, Mississippi. The Pass Christian Cadet School, home of the Gulf Coast Cadet Corps, made a pivotal contribution to the Allied forces’ sealift capacity during the war. However, it was shuttered in 1950.
Reviving that legacy at USM by designating the Gulf Coast campus as the Mississippi Maritime Academy would honor Mississippi’s past while answering a strategic need.
Establishing a state maritime academy at USM would require coordination among the university, industry partners, state legislators and MARAD.
The Maritime Academy Act of 1958 outlines federal support eligibility, including requirements like mandatory Coast Guard licensing exams before graduation and accepting at least 10% out-of-state students. The governor may also request the assignment of Navy, Coast Guard or Maritime Service personnel as instructors and request access to a training vessel.
USM has the location, expertise and industry partnerships to lead the way. By leveraging these existing strengths, it can help secure America’s maritime future, strengthen its regional economy and contribute meaningfully to national defense.
Now is the time to act.

When hospitals close, communities reel. Even in well-covered Massachusetts, some regions of the state still struggle to access its nation-leading health care. And after decades of hospital consolidation, the system is staring down federal changes likely to make the hard job of providing care for underserved communities even more challenging.
The post Red li[...]","FROM THE CENTER of downtown Boston, getting to a hospital or health center can be as straightforward as walking a few blocks in any direction. Within 30 minutes of drive time from Tufts Medical Center, there are 23 other acute care hospitals, according to state data.  
In more far-flung regions of the state, a long drive or a patchwork of transit modes can stand between someone in need of health care and the place best able to provide it. Within 30 minutes of Berkshire Medical Center, the midsized nonprofit community hospital in Pittsfield across the commonwealth from Boston, there are no other acute care hospitals. Same for Cape Cod Hospital.  
While most health care analyses rank Massachusetts at the pinnacle of state health system performance – consistently sitting among the states with the best health care coverage and access, highest childhood vaccination rates, highest health insurance coverage, lowest infant mortality, and fewest premature avoidable deaths – geographic barriers persist. And the looming promise of Medicaid cuts – plus an already overburdened system in regions like southeastern Massachusetts, where staffing shortages and higher rates of uninsurance are exacerbating health care costs – casts a pall over the comparatively sunny overall health stats. 
“We know that patients face many barriers to accessing care, and geographic distance is one of those barriers,” said Amie Shei, president and CEO of the Worcester-based Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts. “It’s not simply the number of miles from point A to point B along a straight line, it’s the particular options this person has access to.” (Shei is on the board of MassINC, CommonWealth Beacon’s publisher.) 
The state has several ways to measure and identify geographically vulnerable medial areas. One measure tracked by the Department of Public Health is health workforces shortages, which is often a measure of geographic vulnerability because people in areas with fewer doctors and health resources have fewer care options within a reasonable distance. Five Massachusetts regions are federally designated as geographic areas with a shortage of providers: Dukes County, a combined stretch of Hampden and Hampshire counties, Nantucket County, the North Quabbin region of Franklin and Worcester counties, and the Southern Berkshires. 
Similarly, the state has 46 “medically underserved areas” – geographic areas and with a lack of access to primary care services – almost all of which have held the designation for around three decades and are scattered across the state from Berkshire to Dukes counties in rural and urban centers.  
Travel and geography alone are not the main driver of access issues, but in a cost- and staff-strained health care environment, it’s a part of “all of the above” calculation that explains why Massachusetts residents sometimes go without care. 
Even if the direct financial hurdle to medical care can be cleared, someone may need to have family or friends who can give them a ride, or have public transit that’s reliable and can get the person near enough to their care facility in time, or secure child care while half a day is spent traveling to and from appointments. 
“All of this takes mental energy,” noted Shei. “It takes access to technology and being able to navigate a complex system. The more barriers you layer on, the more likely it is that someone may delay or forego care.”  
In the 1960s, Massachusetts boasted well over 100 hospitals, scattered around the state but still centered in Eastern Massachusetts. Through closures and consolidations, the number plummeted to just 65 acute hospitals in 2023, according to state data. While a few hospitals have re-opened since 2023, the Steward Health Care bankruptcy crisis revealed serious cracks in the system and led directly to community hospital closures in Boston and Ayer. 
Since the 1990s, the economic landscape of health care has experienced “rapid and continual change,” Cheryl Damberg, director of the RAND Center of Excellence on Health System Performance, testified before Congress in 2023. “Consolidation in the health care market is endemic and is happening in all parts of the health care delivery system. Across the United States, health care markets are dominated by a few large players, and the footprints of these players continue to expand.”  
Following a wave of consolidation in the early- and mid-1990s, there were 1,573 hospital mergers from 1998 to 2017 and another 428 hospital and health system mergers announced from 2018 to 2023, according to KFF research. The share of community hospitals that are part of a larger health system also increased from 53 percent in 2005 to 68 percent in 2022. 
“Hospitals are not interchangeable parts in a health care machine,” Boston University health care analysts Alan Sager and Deborah Socolar warned in 2002, advocating for saving the Deaconess-Waltham Hospital, which closed the next year. “They have deep ties to doctors, programs, patients, and communities.” 
In other words, when a hospital closes, it creates a chain reaction in the community. Nearby residents will need to find alternative health care providers. Experts like Sager and Socolar warn that ambulance travel time will increase, and emergency room and inpatient crowding will worsen at surviving hospitals. The more closures, the more strain. 
For those who can afford coverage and want to access it, geography can be a hurdle. Acute health care facilities remain tightly centered around the Greater Boston hub. This is, of course, the most populous region of the state, served by dense webs of public transit, and is home to dozens of hospitals, clinics, and educational institutions – the heart of the state’s famed meds and eds economy.  
Meanwhile, Southeastern Massachusetts and the Cape and Islands report some of the highest levels of uninsurance in the state, have fewer available ICU beds and acute care centers, and are afflicted by a clinician shortage more pronounced than the state as a whole. 
“Health care access issues are multifaceted, and residents in the Commonwealth can face compounding effects from challenges accessing their care on top of the known financial barriers to affording care,” said Health Policy Commission Executive Director David Seltz. “This leaves lower-income and rural families particularly vulnerable to delaying or foregoing needed care.” 
In its most recent report on access, released last June, the Center for Health Information & Analysis (CHIA) found that 41 percent of Massachusetts residents surveyed reported difficulty accessing care in 2023. The most common issue was an inability to get an appointment with a doctor’s office or clinic as soon as needed (25.6 percent), followed by issues getting appointments withs specialists (23.3 percent), the doctors’ office or clinic not accepting new patients (19.1 percent) or their insurance type (12.6 percent), and being unable to get an appointment due to transportation issues (4.4 percent). 
But the transit issues became much more pronounced as income levels drop and mobility or health issues worsen. More than one in 10 residents reported transportation-related difficulties if they had a family income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line ($44,367 for a family of four in 2025) or if they reported being in fair or poor health or having activity limitations. 
In its 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment, Baystate Franklin Medical Center, Franklin County’s only acute care hospital, identified “access to transportation arose as an overwhelming need” in the communities served by the facility. The 107-bed, not-for-profit hospital serves the most rural county in the state. Though the county’s regional transit authority covers the largest service area of the state’s RTAs – some 1,121 square miles – the medical center noted that bus routes do not reach the smaller towns and traveling by bus outside of the area requires transferring between regional transit authorities. (For the 118 residents of the tiny town of Monroe in the northwest corner of Franklin County, for example, the closest hospital for the past decade was Baystate Franklin Medical Center, only accessible by an hour-long car ride.) 
“Those without a car said they sometimes find they simply cannot get where they need to go when they need to get there or find themselves with long waits for the next bus to take them home,” the report stated. “The lack of transportation exacerbates inequities, as people miss out on education, work, and help in places they cannot reach without a car.” 
 A June 2024 presentation from the Health Policy Commission reviewing health access reports over the past 15 years noted similar findings. Residents of more rural regions faced physical barriers, such as available and affordable public transportation, to accessing needed substance use disorder treatment as instances of substance abuse spiked across the state. 
According to the commission’s research, commercially-insured residents living in the lowest-income areas of the state were much more likely to have no primary care visits than those living in higher income parts of the state, with the disparity especially pronounced among children. While geographic access to care may not be the only factor explaining this finding, the commission noted, it is likely an important contributor. 

Even as Gov. Maura Healey touted recent state health rankings from the Commonwealth Fund, which released its 2025 nationwide scorecard in June, the governor took note of the federal challenges that are looming. 
“Massachusetts is yet again the best state in the nation for health care,” she said in a statement at the time. Despite significant progress, “we know there is still more work to be done, especially as President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ are trying to take away health care from hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents. We’re going to continue our work to make sure everyone can access high-quality, affordable health care, and speak out against attempts to take us backwards.” 
Overall Rankings for 2025 Scorecard on State Health System Performance from The Commonwealth Fund report.
Despite the rosy outlook provided by think tank rankings – and before the cuts to Medicaid were threatening to exacerbate the gulf between the haves and have nots – digging below the surface of the state-level stats shows a Commonwealth in which residents face very different health care realities. 
Take, for example, the ratios of direct patient care physicians. In 2023, Massachusetts had 442 direct patient care physicians, who are usually paid directly for services rather than through insurance, per 100,000 residents, ranking first nationally compared to the national average of 278.0. But the spread by county was immense. Suffolk County, which includes most of Greater Boston’s many health institutions, boasts 1,277.4 direct patient care physicians per 100,000 residents, but several counties drop below the national rate. That includes Essex County with 219.2, Plymouth County with 173, Bristol County with 147.2, Franklin County with 143.6, to a low of 89.7 in Nantucket County. Similar gaps exist in primary care physician ratios. 
Although some regions have fewer health facilities available, the ratio of physicians remains above the national average even with significant geographic spread because the county population itself is lower.  
Measuring only by physicians per person or drive distance to a hospital, though a useful baseline, can miss the difficult realities of accessing care in very remote areas, forcing locals and their representatives into years-long fights for better care closer to home. 
This was the case for the North Adams area, perched in the northwest corner of the state in the far reaches of the 130,000-resident Berkshire County. After its regional hospital abruptly closed in 2014, the closure not only cut off residents from nearby health care. The Berkshire Eagle reported about 530 people lost their jobs in a matter of days. 
A long bureaucratic process stood in the way of the facility opening as a critical access hospital, which would make it eligible to get federal Medicaid and Medicare funding. It was technically too close to the Pittsfield hospital 40 minutes away by car and to the hospital in Bennington, Vermont, which is about 30 minutes away by car but 2 hours and 45 minutes by public transit.  
Since the site closed, locals and US. Rep Richard Neal advocated for about a decade for the federal classification that would bring care back to the areas. Neal said he finally was able to change the classification language because the mountainous area depends on a single lane highway, experiences difficult weather in the winter, and deeply needed a full-service critical access hospital. 
“Most of the stories, overwhelmingly, across America, are about hospital closures,” he said at the re-opening in 2024. “America’s got a real challenge with rural health care. Today we celebrate this opening against all odds; this return is for all of you in Berkshire County.” 

Though the loss of an entire hospital leaves a visible service dent in an area, contractions in specialized care areas also push patients to travel longer distances for services like maternity care or mental health supports. 
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity services, according to Health Policy Commission data, and two birth centers in Beverly and Holyoke have closed. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s policy center reported in 2024 that New England nursing home closures have outpaced the rest of the country since 2010, with Massachusetts losing almost 10,000 nursing homes beds by 2023.  
The loss of facilities often sparks furor from the surrounding communities, with mixed results. State officials opted not to save two former Steward Health properties – Nashoba Valley Medical Center and Carney Hospital – despite forceful objection. 
Attempted state budget belt tightening put the Pappas Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Canton, which serves disabled children, on the chopping block and would have redirected services and children. Though outcry halted the move for at least the next fiscal year, the facility’s long-term financial health is far from secure. 
But community hospitals and state officials alike are bracing for an increasingly grim financial picture after the 2026 midterms. 
In July, Congress passed and the president signed a sweeping tax and spend bill that cuts about $1 trillion of federal health spending over a decade, reversing efforts during prior Democratic administration to expand access through more robust Medicaid programming and the Affordable Care Act. 
Up to 203,000 more Massachusetts residents could be left without insurance because of the bill, according to a new Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation report, putting even more financial pressure on the institutions providing care. 
 On an episode of The Codcast in August, Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health, painted a grim financial picture. Unless efforts are made to roll back or adjust the proposed cuts, the tax bill could create a hole of more than $100 million for the system that would then have to be made up by program cuts or finding a way to increase revenue, Dickson said. 
“We’ll be greatly impacted by this,” he said. “How badly? Will they kick the can down the road? We don’t know? … We’re just doing everything we can to stay true to who we are, to shore up the organization as best we can today where we have an operating loss, such that we’ll be more prepared for what happens” next fiscal year. 
The week after that podcast, UMass Memorial announced more service cuts through its affiliate Community Healthlink, which provides mental health, substance abuse, and homelessness services anchored in Worcester. The Fitchburg adult mental health service BUDD, or Builds Understanding and Develops Direction, program will permanently close on October 23. 
In a statement, UMass Memorial Health said Community Healthlink “has spent the past several months assessing operations across its programs to support the organization’s long-term viability,” but the program “has struggled to maintain a consistent client census due to its specialized nature and closed referral system.” 
Baystate Health, the largest health care system in Western Massachusetts, runs some of the only major hospitals in more rural counties like Franklin. Its chief financial officer told The Boston Globe in July that, on top of recent staff cuts and significant financial loss, the medial group expects an annual loss of $30 to $50 million based on their analysis of the tax bill. 
Michael Curry, the president and CEO of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, said the tax bill creates a dire conundrum for the state’s health care system.

“It would be unsustainable without the federal partnership, the federal funds,” he told CommonWealth Beacon in May. “So, you cut programs, right? You might cut benefits, right?” Just because a person is pushed off Medicaid, he said, doesn’t mean the state is off the hook for costs, which only gets more expensive the more emergency services are used in place of regular care. 
Losing out on immediately and easily accessible health care facilities leaves gaps in essential care coverage. Geographic access issues also increase the odds that a patient would opt for an emergency room visit rather than seeking primary care. 
“Limited access to primary care can lead to potentially avoidable [emergency] and inpatient hospital use and associated higher spending, as well as worse patient outcomes, especially for patients managing chronic conditions,” the Health Policy Commission noted in January. “Patients with distance, transportation, or language barriers to accessing primary care are also more likely to use the [emergency department] for non-emergent conditions.” 
While Massachusetts rates among the top states for access and affordability – a combined category – in the Commonwealth Fund report, it ranks 35th in avoidable hospital use and cost. This measures factors including avoidable emergency room visits, preventable hospitalizations, employer-sponsored insurance and Medicare spending per patient, and primary care spending as a share of total health care spending. 
Some resources could, in theory, be accessible without needing to travel long distances from rural areas. 
Telehealth services expanded dramatically during the Covid-19 pandemic. Two thirds of behavioral health care visit were over telehealth in 2022, the Health Policy Commission found, but a 2023 report found that more could be done to increase access for more rural and vulnerable populations.  
Patients living in small town or rural areas were 8.3 percentage points less likely to use telehealth compared to urban residents, according to the report, and patients living in communities with better internet access were 5.5 percentage points more likely to be telehealth users. 
For those who must travel for appointments, or would simply prefer in-person care, high cost is the most obvious impediment. But hidden costs are still expensive – in effort, in time, in delayed recovery, in system strain. 
“Beyond system-wide obstacles like long wait times for appointments, difficulties or delays in receiving approvals for needed care, and increasing out-of-pocket costs and medical debt, even once an appointment is made, many patients struggle with barriers to accessing that care,” said Selz of the Health Policy Commission. “Individuals who cannot take time off during a workday or secure childcare for an appointment struggle to find providers who are available outside of regular business hours. Transportation – either trying to utilize public transportation or relying on support networks to get to appointments – can pose a real geographic challenge.” 
“These difficulties compound and make it harder for people to access the care they need,” he said, “deepening existing health disparities.”

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia’s highest court will take on a legal battle over the state’s school vaccination requirements, but it denied a request by state school officials that it do so quickly. 
The state Supreme Court on Thursday set a deadline of Dec. 12 for the West Virginia Board of Education to prepare its appeal of a Raleigh County judge’s July ruling against it. That ruling was in regards to a lawsuit brought by three Raleigh County families over the board’s refusal to accept religious exemptions to the state’s mandatory school vaccine requirements. 
Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in July granted a preliminary injunction in the case that allows students in the case to attend class with a religious exemption to the vaccination requirements. 
The school board had filed notice of appeal and asked the high court to both expedite a review of the appeal and temporarily halt the proceedings in the lower court. 
In the scheduling order Thursday, the court denied both motions. Justices also set a deadline of Jan. 26 for the plaintiffs in the case to respond to the board’s appeal. The board will then have until Feb. 16, 2026 to write a reply, if necessary. 
After the Feb. 16 reply brief deadline, the court writes, the appeal will be ready for review. 
The Raleigh lawsuit is one case in a legal battle over religious freedom and the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. Every state requires school students to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases including polio, chicken pox and measles. Florida officials announced this week plans to eliminate its vaccine mandates. 
West Virginia has been one of only five states that have not allowed students to opt out of the shots because of their religious or philosophical objections to them. 
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his second day in office requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. His order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act. He argues that the religious freedom law, when read alongside the vaccination law, calls for the religious exemptions. 
Morrisey has not rescinded that executive order, even though the state Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have established those religious exemptions in state code. 
Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble has scheduled a two-day hearing next week on a  permanent injunction in the lawsuit, which he recently consolidated with a lawsuit brought against the state health department by two parents of immunocompromised students over its issuance of religious exemptions. Plaintiffs in that case are represented by the ACLU of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
The hearing is set for Sept. 10 and 11 at the Raleigh County Judicial Center. During that hearing, the judge has said he wants to consider issues that include whether the state’s vaccination law is constitutional without religious exemptions and the authority of Morrisey’s executive order.

Larry Rhoden’s new draft legislation addresses many of the details of a proposed $650 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Sioux Falls, but doesn’t address at least three areas of concern raised by lawmakers ahead of the Sept. 23 special session where they’ll consider the bill.
Those concerns were raised in the seven months since the collapse of an earlier, more expensive rural Lincoln County prison proposition during the regular legislative session:

The bill calls for competitive bidding on the project’s subcontracts, but would not seek bids for a new construction manager at-risk.
Neither the legislation nor Rhoden’s recently launched “Frequently Asked Questions” webpage contains a full accounting of millions of dollars already spent on the Lincoln County plan.
Questions remain about potential one-time construction-related costs and ongoing costs, such as road improvements at the prison site and the operational budget for a newer, larger facility.

Some see need for more bids
Lawmakers raised questions about the first issue during meetings of the state’s Project Prison Reset task force.
The governor convened that group in the aftermath of the February legislative vote that halted a plan to build an $825 million, 1,500-bed prison on a controversial site in rural Lincoln County.

The task force voted in July to back a plan for a 1,500-bed facility on undeveloped land in northeastern Sioux Falls. Its members also voted to cap the price of that prison at $650 million.
During the group’s final meeting in July, some members asked how many offers the state had when it first asked for a construction manager at-risk for the earlier, Lincoln County proposal. The answer was one — a bid from partners JE Dunn of Kansas City and Henry Carlson Construction of Sioux Falls.
House Speaker Pro Tempore Rep. Karla Lems, R-Canton, told South Dakota Searchlight she still has questions on why the state wouldn’t consider seeking bids for construction managers.
The specter of a Nebraska prison, being built for $313 million near Lincoln, was also an issue raised by the task force. The Rhoden administration, on its FAQ page, says the two facilities are too different for an apples-to-apples comparison.
Lems said Tuesday that lawmakers like her who weren’t on the task force need to know more about that.
“There’s just still so many questions that are swirling, whether it’s the cost, how they’re doing this in Nebraska, how come we only have one bid,” Lems said.
Sunk costs
Sen. Mike Rohl, R-Aberdeen, wasn’t on the task force, either, but said the state clearly needs a replacement for the oldest parts of the 144-year-old state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
That doesn’t mean he’s satisfied with what he knows just yet. Lawmakers voted to let the Department of Corrections use up to $60 million to prepare the Lincoln County site back in 2024. By the time they voted against further funding for the project in February, about $50 million of that money had been spent or obligated.
Prison leader quits as prison vote looms

The prison FAQ page says the state was able to get back a share of that money by reusing design elements in its updated, lower-cost Sioux Falls prison design, but the page still says that an accounting of total sunk costs “will be available in early September but will be less than the amount spent at the site.”
Rhoden’s office did not offer an update when asked by South Dakota Searchlight on Thursday.
His administration entered into a purchase agreement with the owners of a plot of land on Benson Road in Sioux Falls, near the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society, for the new prison.
The state would pay $12 million for the land. It would also transfer its Lincoln County land, for which it estimated a $4.5 million agricultural value, to the private landowners who are selling the Sioux Falls site to the state. When the state transferred the Lincoln County land to Department of Corrections control from the Office of School and Public lands back in 2023, it was appraised at around $8 million.
Rohl wants to know why the value changed, why the state didn’t consider putting the land up for purchase by other South Dakotans, and exactly how much cash went into the site the state would hand off in a swap.
“We obviously spent some money on it, and they can’t tell me how much,” Rohl said. “But since we spent money on it, now we’re listing it as worth $4.5 million as part of a trade? There’s something wrong there. I think that’s my biggest holdup at the moment.”
Roads, ongoing costs
During the legislative session, lawmakers pressed corrections officials on the cost to upgrade roads around the Lincoln County site, and to operate the facility once it was built.
The answers put the cost of building higher than the $825 guaranteed maximum price for construction, and became a sticking point prior to that plan’s rejection.
The FAQ page says “more staff will be needed” for the new prison, but that closing parts of the penitentiary will offset some costs.
“The request for this increase will be debated and accomplished through the normal legislative budget process closer to 2029 when the facility would open. We will have more details at that time,” the page says.
Assistant House Majority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, said this week that questions like that are important. Overweg said he doesn’t see the need to rush into a vote, given that the Legislature will return for its regular session in four months.
“I know we need a new prison. I really like the new location. I just want to make sure that we have a firm price,” Overweg said.
Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms told South Dakota Searchlight on Thursday afternoon that lawmakers’ questions “will be answered in the coming days when the full plan is released.”

The state Department of Public Health on Thursday updated its vaccine administration policy, enabling pharmacists to administer vaccines and emergency medications. The maneuver promotes the availability and distribution of vaccines in Massachusetts beyond those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The post Healey puts Mass. on its own vaccine pa[...]","AFTER MONTHS OF state public health officials vowing to protect vaccine access amid drastic federal changes, Gov. Maura Healey on Thursday announced state measures designed to break ties with federal immunization policies, ensure the availability of COVID-19 booster shots at retail pharmacies, mandate insurance coverage of vaccines and establish a regional public health collaborative.
“Under the Trump administration, the CDC has been hijacked by people like Robert Kennedy – people who don’t believe in science and people who don’t believe in science-based health care,” Healey said at a press conference, surrounded by state health care and industry leaders and lawmakers focused on health policy.
“As a result, the government is failing its responsibility to Americans, including Bay Staters,” Healey added. “So we’re here to say: This is not going to happen in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, we will not let Donald Trump or Robert Kennedy get in the way of patients, and the care, and the treatments and the medication that they want and need.”
Department of Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said Massachusetts and health officials across the Northeast will issue guidance later this month surrounding the 2025-2026 flu season. 
DPH on Thursday updated its vaccine administration policy, enabling pharmacists to administer vaccines and emergency medications that have been approved by Goldstein. The maneuver promotes the availability and distribution of vaccines in Massachusetts beyond those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
“The DPH Commissioner may decide to make recommendations for vaccine use in populations or recommend usage schedules that are not listed in the original, FDA-approved or authorized product information,” the policy states. “Under these circumstances, qualified pharmacy personnel may administer those vaccines in accordance with the most current DPH Commissioner recommendations, even if the recommendations differ from the manufacturer’s FDA-approved or authorized labeling.”
The revised policy comes as Massachusetts also looks to extricate itself from recommendations made by the CDC’s revamped federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Healey in July filed legislation that would disentangle state vaccine policies from that panel, enabling Goldstein to establish “routine childhood immunizations” for all residents younger than 19 years old. Healey also incorporated a similar provision into a spending bill filed in August that remains before a House committee. 
The Division of Insurance and DPH issued a bulletin Wednesday requiring insurers to cover vaccines that are “recommended by DPH and not rely solely on CDC recommendations,” the Healey administration said. The bulletin applies to respiratory virus vaccines — including for COVID, flu and RSV — plus routine childhood shots, such as for measles, chickenpox and Hepatitis B.
Healey pointed out no other state has taken a similar approach yet.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans support the insurance directive, administration officials said.
“As Massachusetts takes steps to empower the Department of Public Health to set independent vaccine standards, MAHP member plans remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring coverage of evidence-based care,” MAHP CEO Lora Pellegrini said in a statement. “MAHP and our member plans stand ready to work with the Healey Administration, providers, and public health leaders to ensure that every Massachusetts resident has access to the immunizations they need to stay healthy.”
MassHealth and the Group Insurance Commission are taking similar measures to provide vaccine coverage, Healey said. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy, who’s long voiced skepticism about vaccines, this summer fired all ACIP members and installed new appointees. The panel is slated to hold its next meeting on Sept. 18-19, with votes expected on COVID vaccines.
Kennedy in May announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID shots for healthy pregnant women and children.
“While we hope that their process will utilize a thorough review of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, DPH is prepared to move quickly to provide clear communication, reduce confusion and maintain access to these vital protections,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein said he will have “final say” over state-level guidance. The state will also vet policies through the Massachusetts Vaccine Purchasing Advisory Council, national professional societies and regional public health partners, he said.
Healey, asked about potential federal pushback to Massachusetts charting its own vaccine path, told reporters, “I have an obligation to take care of and look after the well-being and the public health of people in Massachusetts.”
“And I will continue to uphold my responsibility and my constitutional duty,” she added.
The FDA last week approved COVID shots but restricted their availability among healthy children and young adults, the AP reported. The FDA also revoked the emergency authorization for Pfizer’s shot to children under 5 years old. Shots were previously available to all individuals six months and older, regardless of health conditions, according to NPR.
In light of the FDA changes, CVS last week said the pharmacy chain could not administer COVID vaccine shots in Massachusetts, Nevada and Mexico, even to individuals with prescriptions, “due to the current regulatory environment,” according to CBS News. Walgreens was also limiting access to the shots.
In a countermeasure, DPH has issued a standing order that will allow pharmacists to administer COVID booster shots to Bay Staters over age 5. The Board of Registration in Pharmacy posted the standing order Wednesday, outlining the various types of COVID shots that can be administered to individuals ages 12 and older, as well as to children ages 5 to 11.
Healey said CVS and Walgreens will start scheduling COVID vaccination appointments on Friday. Children under age five can receive COVID vaccines from their pediatricians, the administration said.
Goldstein, pressed on who is eligible to receive COVID boosters at those pharmacies, noted the state has yet to release guidance for the upcoming flu season.
“We still have our active recommendations for 2024-2025, and those recommendations say that anyone six months and older is eligible for a COVID vaccine,” Goldstein said. “We recommend, if someone wants to get it right now, they look to those eligibility criteria.”
Among adults ages 19 and older in Massachusetts, roughly 80 percent of COVID vaccines were administered in pharmacies during the 2024-2025 flu season, according to DPH.
Massachusetts is also spearheading an initiative to establish a public health collaborative with states in New England and the Northeast. The collaborative will develop “evidenced-based” recommendations for vaccines, disease surveillance, emergency preparedness and supporting state public health labs, Healey’s office said. 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson launched the West Coast Alliance on Wednesday, aimed at coordinating regional public health guidance. The group, citing “recent federal actions that have undermined the independence of the CDC and raised concerns about the politicization of science,” will start off by focusing on immunization policy.
“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science. California, Oregon and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk,” the governors said in a joint statement.
Florida on Wednesday announced plans to end all vaccine mandates, including for students. Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo said at a press conference that each vaccine mandate “is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” according to CNN.
Healey called Florida’s action “crazy.”
“I think Ron DeSantis is putting politics over public health,” Healey said. “I think a lot of people are going to think twice about going to Florida. I don’t think measles was a souvenir that you were looking to return with after a trip to Disney World.”
Vaccine policy turbulence at the federal level has been compounded by escalating hesitancy and skepticism, leading to a lower uptake in immunizations.
New poll results Thursday from Massachusetts Families for Vaccines show that 70 percent of registered voters support bills from Rep. Andy Vargas and Sen. Ed Kennedy (H 2544 / S 1557) that would eliminate the religious carveout for immunizations required in public, private and charter K-12 schools. The proposals had a hearing in early June.
The vast majority of respondents also said they believe childhood immunizations are safe and effective, according to the poll conducted by Beacon Research.
“To protect our classrooms, our families, and our most vulnerable residents from preventable diseases, it is important that we remove the religious exemption loophole,” Vargas said in a statement. “We would be catching up to neighboring states and even the Texas Catholic schools, which no longer recognize religious exemptions.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Elizabeth Hardy is resigning as the state’s foster care ombudsman, a job created by the Legislature to investigate ongoing issues with children, families and workers in West Virginia’s overwhelmed child welfare system.
A spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey confirmed Thursday evening that Hardy is leaving the role and said she will become a commissioner at the Bureau for Behavioral Health.
Hardy, a former foster parent, has served as ombudsman a little more than a year and was the second person to hold the position. Lawmakers created the foster care ombudsman role in 2019 in an effort to bolster accountability in the troubled foster care system that has struggled with high Child Protective Services case loads, a lack of safe homes for children and accountability.
Along with investigating complaints from foster parents and children, the ombudsman was tasked with advocating for the rights of children and families. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a bill clarifying that the foster care ombudsman would work impartially under the state’s Office of Inspector General. There had been concerns that the role wasn’t able to work independently without interference from foster care officials.
Last November, Hardy told lawmakers that since its inception in 2019, the office of the foster care ombudsman had received more than 3,000 complaints.
“Compared to the state fiscal year of 2024 we have received almost an additional 700 complaints, which is a 171% increase,” Hardy said. “This data trend shows our office’s relevance as a value by the substantial increase in the number of complaints over time.”
She added that part of her work included enforcing the state’s Foster Kinship Parent Bill of Rights and the Foster Child Bill of Rights.
Hardy replaced the state’s first foster care ombudsman Pamela Woodman-Kaehler, whose initial report in 2021 detailed how fear of retaliation and communication problems were pervasive in the foster care system and extended to families caring for foster children. 
The bill creating the position only required that the ombudsman submit reports through 2023. Woodman-Kaehler stepped down in May 2024.
There are a little more than 6,000 children in West Virginia foster care, and the state continues to lead the nation in the rate of children coming into care.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A document submitted by the Alaska Division of Elections to the U.S. Department of Justice in response to a nationwide data request names 70 possible noncitizens who voted or attempted to vote in state or local Alaska elections since 2015.
Among the 70 people are 10 American Samoans from Whittier who now face state criminal charges related to their voting. American Samoans are not considered U.S. citizens by the state, and civil charges against an 11th individual  are now being considered by the Alaska Court of Appeals.
Noncitizen voting remains extraordinarily rare, nationwide figures show, and Carol Beecher, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said there is no evidence that noncitizen voting changed the result of last year’s elections here.
Ahead of last year’s elections, Donald Trump and other Republican politicians said they believed large numbers of non-U.S. citizens would seek to vote and influence the result of elections. 
Since becoming president, Trump has asked Congress to impose citizenship checks on all potential voters. His Department of Justice has asked all 50 states for copies of their voter lists in order to create a national government database. 
Alaska turned over its voter list and other documents to the U.S. Department of Justice last month.
In response to a public records request filed by the Alaska Beacon, the Alaska Division of Elections provided copies of documents it delivered to federal authorities.
Most of the documents, including a copy of the state’s official voter list, were already public. The voter list, for example, is available for purchase from any state elections office and doesn’t include sensitive information beyond a voter’s name, how often they’ve voted, and where they live.
The state’s inactive voter list — showing people whose voter registrations have been flagged for review and possible removal — is also a public record, but it isn’t commonly circulated. Inactive voters can’t cast a ballot without additional ID checks.


WHERE’S THE LIST?
Ordinarily, the Alaska Beacon publishes copies of the documents it obtains via public records requests, but in this case, we’re not publishing the list.
The inactive voter list contains the names and addresses of tens of thousands of Alaskans who have committed no wrongdoing, and we believe the potential harm outweighs the benefit of publishing it.
The list may become available from other sources or news outlets, but because people may be listed as “noncitizens” due to paperwork errors or other innocent mistakes, and because we aren’t able to verify the citizenship of all 541 people, we’re not publishing it. 


The inactive voter list provided to the DOJ and to the Beacon is from August. It includes 541 people whose voter records were tagged “NC” for non-citizen.
But it’s not clear whether these Alaskans are noncitizens or were on the list because of mistakes.
Carol Beecher, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said some people may have been erroneously labeled, so it isn’t correct to say that there were 541 noncitizens registered to vote. 
“As we get more information, things change. So what I’m telling you today on a number may change tomorrow because of new information that we got,” Beecher said in an extended interview on Wednesday.
Stephen Kirch, the division’s spokesperson, said by email that “the DOE cannot say with any degree of certainty whether the current number of NC-coded entries is ‘abnormal’ or ‘unusual’ in a historical context. This is because the number is a moving target and not a static one; it is not tracked.”
The inactive voter list shows only people whose records have been flagged for additional attention and isn’t confirmation that they are not citizens. It may include people who filled out paperwork incorrectly or registered to vote shortly before becoming a citizen. 
“It’s really hard to say whether this particular number (541) is a problem, because there’s so many questions behind even that particular number,” said Mara Kimmel, a former immigration attorney who now works as executive director of the Alaska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
That total also might miss noncitizens who are on the active voter list but haven’t yet been identified.

Beecher said she considers the “NC” tag to be “kind of like a file drawer. You put things into that file based on the status when you put it in there. But that could change.”
Kimmel said that the issue is “never as easy as it seems or as it would be framed. … Noncitizens voting has become a real political hot-button issue.”
In her experience, “there’s so much confusion and misinformation that is born out of a benign desire to participate in your new home.”
In Alaska, residents can register to vote by contacting the Alaska Division of Elections. Residents are also asked if they want to register when they update their driver’s license, get a new driver’s license, and apply for the annual Permanent Fund dividend.
As Beecher explained, if someone attests that they’re not a citizen through one method but says they are a citizen via a different method, that gets the attention of authorities.
“When we have gone in there and looked and contacted them, we have found that usually it was a mistake,” she said.
In other cases, particularly with the state’s “motor-voter” program, the mistake might come from a typo or someone’s misunderstanding of the rules, particularly if they don’t speak fluent English, as might be the case with new immigrants.
The Division of Elections doesn’t have investigative powers, which means voting officials rely on an applicant’s sworn oath about their citizenship. There’s no automatic double-checking, and it’s federally unconstitutional for the division to ask for proof of citizenship.
Judges have thrown out a Kansas law that required voters to verify citizenship, and the U.S. Supreme Court has only partially allowed a different Arizona law.
“All we get is the affirmation, and however frustrating that can be for everyone out there to say, ‘Well, why can’t you make sure?’ Well, we are not given that authority. So essentially, the division takes people at their word is really what it comes down to,” Beecher said.
If someone’s registration is flagged by a complaint or because of a discrepancy in the records, the division forwards the case to the Alaska Department of Law for investigation.
“We provide them with documents if they request that, as pursuant to an investigation, but if not, we may never hear from them,” Beecher said of the investigation.
In 2023, the division flagged the registration of Tupe Smith, a Whittier resident, after she ran for and won a seat on the local school board.
Smith was born in American Samoa, an island territory in the South Pacific. Its residents are U.S. nationals — having some of the same legal rights as other Americans — but aren’t citizens.
During the subsequent investigation, Alaska State Troopers learned of 10 other American Samoans who had voted in Alaska. The state charged them with civil crimes in April, and this week, they were indicted. 
All 10 are labeled noncitizens on the inactive voter list supplied to the Beacon and Department of Justice. They, and another 60 other people, are shown as having voted or attempted to vote at least once during the past 10 years.
It isn’t clear whether all of those ballots were actually counted. Many are labeled as “questioned,” meaning that they were subject to additional ID verification. Beecher said “it’s possible” that some were counted but that she didn’t have numbers.
She believes “very few” noncitizens have voted.
“I’m speaking very anecdotally, because I don’t have those kinds of numbers for you, but our sense is that it’s very small. And I think the underlying reason for that is because there is no nefarious intent out there to try to sway an election. It’s people who either — and this is my personal opinion — they’re confused about the rules or somehow ended up marking something that they didn’t understand,” Beecher said.
Alaska had 605,302 registered voters on Aug. 3, according to Division of Election statistics.
If the noncitizen-tagged voters on the inactive list had still been active, they would have represented just 0.09% of Alaska voters.
Last year, 340,981 Alaskans voted in the state’s November general election. The division’s inactive list shows six noncitizens either voted or attempted to vote in that election.
In Michigan, officials announced in April that they had found 16 credible cases of noncitizen voting out of about 5.7 million votes cast overall, or one per every 360,000 votes.
Nationally, noncitizen voting remains exceptionally rare.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and a supporter of election reform legislation in Alaska, noted that the rate of noncitizen voting in Alaska is likely well below the rate at which legitimate voters are being disqualified because of problems with the state’s absentee voting system.
“Any time you have people who are voting that shouldn’t be voting, that’s cause for concern,” Wielechowski said in an interview Wednesday. 
“But at the same time, we’ve got hundreds of people that we know of, actually thousands of people who were disenfranchised,” he said, referring to the state’s regular practice of disqualifying absentee ballots because of submittal errors.
“In rural Alaska, we had 10% or 15% of the population in rural Alaska that was disenfranchised a couple of years ago, legitimate voters who were disenfranchised because of a bureaucratic technicality that’s not even checked. So I think there’s bigger problems,” Wielechowski said. 
In 2023, Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, proposed legislation that would have required the Division of Elections to cross-check the state’s voter rolls with a national citizenship database. 
“I always like to presume innocence, but we have to put the safeguards in place, and by having the division use those databases as a check and balance, I think that’s a very simple way to make sure that we’re crossing our T’s and dotting I’s,” Vance said Wednesday.
She noted that current Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, won his 2006 primary election via a coin toss that followed a tied election. 
“When you look at how slim some of our elections are, how tight races can be, these numbers matter,” she said.
The Alaska Senate stripped out Vance’s citizenship provision and passed a revised bill, but the Republican-led House failed by a single vote to take up the legislation on the last day of the regular session in 2024. The bill died at the end of the session, and lawmakers started anew this spring. 
In recent years, the Alaska Department of Law has requested funding for a part-time elections investigator. The Legislature has not approved that request. 
“We shouldn’t have anyone voting in our elections on any level who shouldn’t be,” Vance said. 
“This is important and significant because we want to make sure that we protect the sovereignty of every individual’s vote,” she said.

The August jobs increase was the lowest for that month since 2010 in the aftermath of the Great Recession. June’s decrease was the first jobs loss since a December 2020 COVID-19 surge shuttered restaurants and hotels.
States begin to see job losses from Trump’s cuts, housing and spending slowdowns

A recent Stateline analysis showed that Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by recent hiring slowdowns, based on surveys and layoff reports, while California and Texas appeared to continue job gains.
Job openings fell to a 10-month low in July, according to a separate government report issued Sept. 3, and there were more unemployed people than jobs available for the first time since 2021.
Last month’s revisions to the jobs report enraged President Donald Trump when they first appeared Aug. 1. The revisions showed the nation had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, Erika McEntarfer. He offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report entirely. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post at the time that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”

This month, 1 million bushels of sorghum, commonly called milo, are leaving the Pawnee County Co-Op in Larned by rail, but those sales of last year’s product are taking a bite out of this year’s upcoming crop sales, said Barnes, the co-op’s chief financial officer. 
Like many in agriculture, Barnes is worried about milo sales and how Kansas farmers will earn profits in diminished markets amid increasing costs to farm.
Along with tariffs and trade wars, the Trump administration cut the U.S. Agency for International Development program that distributed food abroad. The move eliminated one market for Kansas grains.
At 70 years old, Barnes has a solid grasp on the history of agriculture, and while he remembers tough times, what’s happening right now stands out.
“If we go back to 2016, wheat was $2.88 a bushel. Corn was $2.82 a bushel, and soybeans were $8.90 a bushel, and milo was $4.32 a hundredweight,” Barnes said. “Then you jump into 2022. Wheat was $8.48 at the end of the year. Milo was $12.82 a hundredweight. Corn was $7.88 a bushel and soybeans were $14.94.”
Today, the picture is grim. Barnes said wheat sits at $4.22 per bushel, milo is $5.71 a hundredweight, corn is $3.90 per bushel and soybeans are $9.34 per bushel.
Prices are low at a time when Kansas farmers are having an excellent crop after a summer of good weather, said Andy Hineman, vice president of the Kansas Grain Sorghum Producers Association and a fifth-generation farmer in Dighton.
“It’s going to be a tremendous crop for much of the sorghum growing area,” he said. “The prediction on production this year is 9.9 million metric tons (in the United States). Normally, we’ve been around 10 million.”
Kansas farmers produce about half of the crop, Hineman said.
 
International trade
Typically, about 60% of the milo crop is exported, with 90% of the exports going to China, according to a sorghum association spokesman. But almost all of the China market has been lost. 
“There’s a lot of work being done on improving domestic use of milo and improving additional markets,” Hineman said. “In the past, a lot of our milo exports have gone to China, and so not having them as a trade partner right now is definitely a challenge that I think we’re all concerned about.”
Mexico and India are markets for potential milo sales, he said. In addition, options are available domestically, and Hineman noted a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration study is looking at milo for human consumption.
“Historically, it’s been more of a feed crop and ethanol crop, but there are some smaller mills that do produce milo flour and sorghum food,” Hineman said. “But it’s the first time the FDA is getting behind it and doing a study, so that’s really exciting to see.” 
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, agreed that new markets must be found. 
“If China is shutting the door on us, we’ve got to find an opening somewhere,” he said. “That, to me, right now speaks to India.”
Gregg Ibendahl, associate professor in agricultural economics at Kansas State University, said it’s difficult to predict where future markets might be but that tariffs and shifting global trade may upend the United States’ international role. 
“South America is becoming, technology wise, probably almost as good as we are when it comes to growing a lot of crops,” he said. “It wouldn’t surprise me if South America really would become the low-cost leader in producing grain. Are we going to still be the primary supplier? Are we going to be a secondary supplier?”
At this stage, it’s difficult to tell how tariffs will affect the country’s position, he said.
Barnes is working to make connections to make sure the next milo crop out of the fields won’t be stored for long. He’s traveling to San Antonio soon to participate in a commodity conference where he’ll be able to sit down with international buyers. 
He went to a pet food forum in Kansas City recently, something he’d never attended before but that he believed might offer grain sales. 
“I was taught to dream and taught to look for the silver lining, and so that’s where I’m at today,” he said. “It’s been a challenge, but a good challenge. In other words, we’re not waiting for the world to come to us. We’re out beating the bush, trying to make the sales and not waiting for somebody else to come to our door. We’re out marketing ourselves.”
 
Local impacts
When farm income drops, it not only jeopardizes farm operations but the entire community, Barnes said.
Local businesses struggle when agricultural income and spending drop. 
Barnes said the co-op pays $3.8 million in property tax, more than $34 million in labor and that studies have shown every dollar generated in agriculture is multiplied seven times in the local community.
Levendofsky said he spoke to a banker who was only making agricultural loans secured by land, something the long-time farmer said he doesn’t remember happening before. 
Kevin Swayne, president and CEO at High Plains Farm Credit, said his company isn’t taking those kinds of steps. 
“Obviously there’s some more challenging times, rising input costs and lower commodity prices, which is tightening up margins and putting pressure on a lot of operations, especially in Kansas,” he said. “That’s always going to understandably raise concerns about access to credit and financial support.”
Each bank sets its own lending underwriting standards and risk profiles, Swayne said. 
“We keep a list of those loans that get denied and are delinquent even, and so far our delinquencies have stayed very manageable and are not spiking yet. It’s my understanding in the industry that you’re starting to see some of that,” Swayne said. 
High Plains’ philosophy is to partner with customers, and Swayne said they work with farmers to develop a plan that includes commodity price assumptions and government payments, as well as whether they use crop insurance to manage risk.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-908450064-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 09:57:48.921917

The federal mega-bill that cut social welfare programs will potentially undo Medicaid expansion in the state, and it could leave North Carolina with a big bill for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Additionally, the state Department of Health and Human Services is set to make cuts to provider’s Medicaid payments because it says the state legislature has not provided enough money to maintain the status quo in the health insurance program.
“There’s a lot happening all at once,” Jonathan Kappler, chief of staff and deputy secretary for external affairs at the state Department of Health and Human Services told the task force. 
SNAP helps about 1.4 million North Carolinians pay for food. The federal government used to pay all the benefit costs, but the bill President Donald Trump signed into law in July requires states to pick up a share of the expenses based on their payment error rates. That part of the law kicks in in a few years.
The federal government will continue to pay the entire cost for states with error rates below 6%.

North Carolina’s error rate in 2024 was 10.21%, according to the USDA. States with error rates over 10% will pay 15% of benefit costs. The bill for North Carolina would come to $420 million, Kappler said. The cost calculations will be based on state error rates in  2025 or 2026. 
Beginning next year, the federal government will no longer split SNAP administrative costs with the states 50-50, but will pay 25%.
County workers determine eligibility, and DHHS is working with counties to drive down the error rate, Kappler said. 
County workers also have to monitor revised work requirements for adults using SNAP and, in 2027, new work requirements for people ensured under Medicaid expansion.  
“There’s a lot of additional pressure on counties,” Kappler said. 
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), a task force member, brought up the concerns of grocers who worry about SNAP benefit reductions leading to reduced sales. 
“I’ve met with the folks from Food Lion and some of the other grocery stores, and it’s a significant amount of money, and they’re concerned about it,” he said. SNAP payments amount to 18% of some stores total sales. 
Medicaid changes
The federal law caps the provider tax North Carolina uses to pay the non-federal cost of Medicaid expansion. The federal government pays 90% of expansion costs, while the provider taxes pay 10%. 
New costs for Medicaid expansion administration will outpace funding, “and that would end Medicaid expansion in North Carolina,” Kappler said. Discussions about how to pay for the increased administrative costs have begun, he said. 
Sen. Jim Burgin (Photo: NCGA)
More than 675,000 North Carolinians are enrolled in expanded Medicaid, according to DHHS.
The federal law will result in North Carolina losing about $50 billion over 10 years, Kappler said. Most of that will show up as reduced payments to hospitals. Rural hospitals will be hit hard.
The federal law included a $50 billion rural health fund. Half the money will be distributed evenly among the states with approved applications. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will decide where the other $25 billion will go. 
The $50 billion in federal money adds up to about one-third of the estimated loss of Medicaid funds in rural areas, KFF reported.
The stopgap budget the legislature passed in July had $319 million less than DHHS asked for to maintain the status quo in the Medicaid program. In response, DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai outlined provider rate cuts scheduled to start Oct. 1.
Burgin said legislators are going to try to make sure provider rates aren’t cut. 
“We’re planning on coming back and working on it,” he said. 
Kappler said “productive discussions” about the Medicaid shortfall are ongoing, and there’s a way to avoid cuts now,  if not for the entire fiscal year.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/snapphoto_0-1024x7681756298817-1.jpg,,,2025-09-05 09:57:48.921917

John Muir once wrote “everything is refreshed” by a summer storm in the Sierra Nevada. But then, as now, the lightning strikes that come with them pose a perennial wildfire risk.
Fires raging in the Sierra foothills have burned nearly 14,000 acres, prompted evacuations and destroyed the historic Gold Rush town of Chinese Camp. Lightning ignited these fires — an occurrence that a new study says will likely happen more often in California, reports CalMatters’ Rachel Becker. 
From Tuesday to Wednesday, dry thunderstorms rolled across the Central Valley and the Bay Area. Though exactly how many lightning strikes hit California during that 31-hour period is unclear, an expert at the National Lightning Safety Council estimated that 11,000 bolts of electricity struck the ground.
During that same time period at least 45 new fires ignited, said Cal Fire battalion chief David Acuña.

Acuña: “We can’t collectively say they’re all lightning fires, but we can say that there were a large number of lightning strikes and a large number of fires.”

As hotter, drier conditions become more common due to climate change, researchers found that lightning is more likely to strike when dry lands are at risk for igniting. From 2030 to 2060, some Western states could see as many as 12 more days of lightning striking the ground per year — with parts of northeast California and the eastern Sierra potentially seeing an increase as well.

Dmitri Kalashnikov, the study’s lead author: “You get this very hazardous situation in terms of fire risk, where you have lighting that hits the dry vegetation. You’ll get an ignition, but then there’s no downpours to extinguish the flame — so that fire can grow.”

For years, the California Department of Motor Vehicles made millions from selling towed cars without giving the owners much of a chance to claim the money. But that’s changing now, after CalMatters published an investigation on the practice earlier this year. Find out what the DMV is doing from CalMatters’ Byrhonda Lyons.



Sluggish science scores

Science test scores for K-12 California schools remained relatively stagnant following the 2016 launch of a new science curriculum — raising concern among some education experts who say that science should be prioritized more, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Three years after Next Generation Science Standards rolled out, California assessed students in science for the first time, with only 30% of students meeting the standard on the state exam in 2019. Last year it was only 30.7%. Wide gaps in test scores also exist among groups of students, particularly among low-income and Black students. 
There are a few reasons for this: Carrying out the curriculum was especially hard through remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic because the curriculum required hands-on projects. When in-person learning returned, schools also focused their recovery efforts on literacy, math and attendance.

Speaking of pandemic-era learning: Carolyn also reports on the settlement reached Wednesday between a group of families and Los Angeles Unified, which will affect about 250,000 students. In 2020, the families joined a class-action lawsuit to sue the district, alleging that it wasn’t doing enough to ensure students were getting a quality education during the pandemic. The settlement requires the district to offer various academic support, including one-on-one tutoring through 2028. Read more here.



CA prison cells reach scorching temps

With temperatures in some California prisons rising to 95 degrees each summer, and climate change driving temperatures to even higher levels, state prison officials are rolling out a $38 million pilot program to cool some prison cells, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
After mounting pressure from activists, lawmakers and judges, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation plans to conduct a test of cooling systems and new insulation at three of the department’s 31 prisons. The pilot, which the Legislature approved this year, will run over the next four years and results are expected by 2029.
But critics say the pilot doesn’t go far enough. It will only affect parts of facilities that house about 8,000 of California’s 91,000 inmates, and no further concrete action is required afterwards.

,California,2025-09-05 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California changed the way it teaches science. But test scores remain low,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/09/science-california/,"Nearly a decade after California revamped its K-12 science curriculum, two-thirds of students failed to meet the statewide standard.","In summary
Nearly a decade after California revamped its K-12 science curriculum, two-thirds of students failed to meet the statewide standard.


A decade ago, California schools introduced a new K-12 science curriculum that was hands-on, interactive and designed to prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. 
But since the state started testing students on the new Next Generation Science Standards in 2019, the first time ever California assessed students in science, test scores have barely budged, with stark gaps among some groups of students.
“In large part, science has not been viewed as a priority. It’s been moved to the back burner,” said Jessica Sawko, education director at the research and advocacy organization Children Now, and former head of the state’s association of science teachers. “But science needs to be a priority. How will we prepare our kids to make sense of the world around them?”
In 2019, three years after most schools began teaching the new science curriculum, only 30% of students met the standard on the state exam. Last year, the number had inched up to only 30.7%.
Wide gaps exist among student groups. Among students whose parents graduated from college, 42% met the standard, compared to 17% of those whose parents never went beyond high school. Fewer than than 21% of low-income students met the standard. Only 15% of Black students met the standard, compared to 61% of Asian students.

Delays and obstacles
There’s a few reasons for the stagnant scores, experts said. Pandemic school closures set achievement back significantly for all subjects, but it especially affected science because so much of the new science curriculum centers on hands-on projects, which were nearly impossible to conduct over Zoom.
And after the pandemic, schools focused their recovery efforts on literacy, math and attendance, the most glaring challenges as students returned to in-person learning. Chronic absenteeism, for example, soared from 10% pre-pandemic to 30% in 2022. 
Another reason for the low science scores is accountability, Sawko and others said. For the first few years of the new science test, the scores were not posted on the state’s Dashboard — the primary means of publicizing students’ academic performance. The rationale is that the test was new and the state was still working out the kinks.
Last year, the results were posted at the bottom of the Dashboard in an area marked “informational purposes.” Unlike the other features of the dashboard, such as math and English language arts scores, science was not color coded to indicate the performance level of individual schools or student groups. The science results were solid gray.
When the new scores are released this fall, science will be color-coded on the Dashboard, but science still falls short of full accountability, advocates said. Low-performing schools won’t be singled out by the state for extra assistance, although that might change next year.

Another obstacle has been teacher training. After California adopted the new standards, it didn’t invest any money in professional development until 2023. For many years, districts used their own funds or found private grants to pay for teacher training, but by fall 2020 at least 30%-40% of teachers had received no training in the new standards, according to a survey by the California Association of Science Educators. Teachers at low-income and rural schools received the least training.
In 2023 the state allotted $85 million to improve math, science and computer science education, but only about $1.5 million went to train teachers in science. The rest went to train teachers in math and computer science – which also recently got new standards – and to host family STEM nights and other activities. The money went to county offices of education to distribute locally. 
The grant expires in 2027, and it’s crucial that the state continue that investment, said Shari Staub, co-leader of the California Math, Science and Computer Science Partnership.
“We are daily faced with public health challenges, climate challenges, equity challenges — all the things a scientifically literate population should be able to address, not just for California but for the world,” Staub said. “If we’re not investing in science, we are not preparing students for the world they are entering.”
Three-dimensional learning
The Next Generation Science Standards were created in 2011 by an education nonprofit called Achieve, with help from 26 states and dozens of science education experts. The idea was to make science more engaging and “three-dimensional,” as the authors put it, by combining concepts from multiple scientific disciplines so students could discover patterns and systems. Students would gain critical thinking skills and a solid understanding of scientific concepts, largely by doing hands-on projects rather than listening to lectures.
Many school districts in California have embraced the new standards and seen scores improve. In fact, California public schools — particularly those in tech hubs — have some of the top science programs in the country. California students routinely win the National Science Bowl, Science Olympiad and other national competitions. 
For the most part, those districts invested their own funds early in the rollout to train their teachers. And they have strong support from parents, financial and otherwise. That amounts to PTA funds that teachers can use to pay for science field trips or extra help in the classroom, plenty of parent volunteers and an overall expectation that science education is a priority. 
None of the top-performing schools were Title I low-income schools, but they weren’t all homogenous affluent schools, either. Some had 25% or more low-income students, large percentages of English learners and diverse student populations. They might have PTA support, but they don’t receive much extra money from the state because they don’t have large numbers of high-needs students.

La Cañada Unified near Pasadena, for example, received only $13,700 per student last year from the state, about $5,000 less than the state average. But more than 77% of students met or exceeded the science standards last year, some of the highest scores in the state. 
Each elementary school in the district has a science lab and an aide to assist with science projects. A summer camp called “STEM-nauts” pairs older students with younger ones for science-themed games and experiments. The high school offers five Advanced Placement science classes and a host of science-related extracurricular activities, including an astronomy club, neuroscience club and chemistry club. Students can do internships at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is a quarter-mile from the high school.
“In our district, the science kids are the cool kids,” said James Cartnal, assistant superintendent. “Science is part of the culture here. We work intentionally and very hard to make it that way.”
‘Think like scientists’
At Lawson Middle School in Cupertino, science is nearly everyone’s favorite subject. The science classrooms are boisterous places with students conducting experiments and trying to figure out solutions. The shelves are well stocked with beakers, scales and microscopes. Colorful tapestries of the periodic table hang from the ceiling. Anime renditions of the elements — including xenon, helium, germanium, cadmium — adorn the walls.
One recent afternoon, students in Emily Adams’ eighth grade science class did a lesson on measurements. Adams started by asking them why accurate measurements are important. Their answers: so astronauts know how much fuel is left in their rocketship; so truck drivers know if their vehicle will fit under an overpass; and so doctors know how much medicine they’re giving a patient.
Then they worked in groups to measure various objects, using an infrared thermometer, an electronic scale and other tools.
“This class is fun. I like all the labs, figuring out how things work in the real world,” said student Neil Dhaman. “P.E. is my favorite class, but this is second.”

Adams said the class was typical, in that she spends about 10 minutes explaining a few main concepts and the students spend the rest of the class on projects related to the concepts. “I want them to focus on skills and critical thinking, not just regurgitate facts,” Adams said. “I want them to think like scientists.”
Cupertino is in the heart of Silicon Valley, home to the Apple computer headquarters and dozens of tech start-ups. Google and Facebook are a few miles away. Despite the lure of six-figure salaries in Silicon Valley, Cupertino Union School District has very little turnover among science teachers, a key reason the science scores are so high, said Marie Crawford, the district’s director of instructional leadership and intervention. 
“The teachers know each other, work together, help each other out,” Crawford said. “It makes a big difference.”
Like La Cañada, Cupertino Union School District does not receive a lot of money from the state. Last year, the state provided $16,400 per student, far below the state average.
In teacher Maryhien Pham’s class, eighth grader Aanya Dhar and her classmates demonstrated how to find the mass of a marble by dropping it into a cylinder of water, and weighing the cylinder before and after. The answer: 3 milliliters. 
“I might want to be a scientist when I grow up,” Dhar said. “I like learning about new things, experimenting, getting to know how things work.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082625_ScienceClass_FM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434
,California,2025-09-05 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,CalMatters created a tool to help you get your money back from the DMV.

The California DMV is now allowing vehicle owners to see if the state owes them money for sales of their towed cars.


For years, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has been keeping profits from the sales of towed cars, without giving the owners much of a chance to claim money that’s rightfully theirs. 
That’s changing, thanks to a CalMatters investigation. 
The state DMV is now offering a lookup tool on its website, allowing people to see if the DMV owes them money from what’s known as a lien sale. The tool is nearly identical to the one CalMatters created for our story in March.


Did your towed car get sold for a profit? Look up your license plate or vehicle ID number in our interactive database at calmatters.org


By law, towing companies, storage yards and car repair shops can sell your car to recoup their costs if you do not pick up your vehicle. It’s known as a lien sale. 
For poor Californians, the tows and compounding fees are often a trap. Police can tow your car for things like expired registration, but you might not be able to get it back if you can’t renew your registration because you have unpaid fees and fines from things like traffic and parking tickets. 
Lien sales have to be approved by the DMV, and any money leftover is supposed to go to the agency. Typically, lien sales end in debt. However, CalMatters found that the DMV collected more than $8 million from nearly 5,300 cars sold at auction between 2016 through the fall of 2024. 
Owners are entitled to that surplus, and have up to three years to claim it. But the agency does not notify owners of the refunds.
When our first story ran, the agency said that it wasn’t required to notify people of their refunds, and there was no mention of how people could claim their lien sale refunds. Now, in addition to the lookup tool, there’s a list of frequently asked questions and instructions on exactly how to claim refunds. 
The DMV also said it had sent more than $5,000 to a family after admitting it erroneously denied the refund request of Stephen McAllister, who was featured in the CalMatters investigation.
“I wouldn’t have known anything about this money without a call from you,” he said. “I think there’s a lot of people in this same situation, and that money means a lot to them.”
His sister, Joan McAllister’s, vehicle racked up $1,113 in parking tickets in San Francisco in 2022 while she was hospitalized. Stephen said someone found her “wandering the streets.”
Eventually, the vehicle was towed and accumulated over $8,300 in storage fees.
Stephen tried to intervene, but he didn’t have the legal authority. By the time he was appointed as her conservator, the towing yard had sold her car, he said.
McAllister requested a refund from the DMV shortly after our story ran. A few months later, the department denied his request. He reached out to CalMatters, and I contacted the DMV. Agency spokesperson Ronald Ongtoaboc apologized and said the denial was an “error.”

Richard Cowan is the former chairperson of the Historic State Capitol Commission.


For more than half a decade, advocates of the state Capitol have sounded the alarm about the $1.1 billion Capitol annex project. This venture is a textbook example of how not to run a public works project. 
All Californians will be affected by its rampant secrecy, nondisclosure agreements, massive cost overruns and the decimation of our treasured Capitol Park. Experts and appointed officials tasked with protecting the historic Capitol building have strongly argued for cost-effective, transparent alternatives that preserve the Capitol’s historic integrity and public access. But every concern was ignored.
For instance, the new Capitol annex will be wider, longer and taller than the historic building it replaces, despite commitments to follow the Secretary of the Interior guidelines for historic properties. The annex’s glass exterior will clash with the original white plaster Capitol, visually overpowering the 1860s landmark. 
How did we get here?
In 2018, when the Capitol annex project was expected to cost $500-$750 million, I resigned as chairperson of the Historic State Capitol Commission. I was objecting to documents being withheld, details being hidden and stakeholders — especially the public  — being excluded.
Now, hard-hitting exposés, alongside growing bipartisan concerns about open government, show that public conversation is finally catching up. Even the news media has been stonewalled when requesting information about the project’s contracts, costs and access plans.
Californians deserve to know how their money is being spent. Assemblymember Joe Patterson’s push for Assembly Bill 1370, which would prohibit lawmakers from signing nondisclosure agreements while conducting public business, is a step in the right direction.  Hopefully this leads to lifting all NDAs related to this project, allowing citizens to ask questions.
But concerns remain about the Capitol’s most iconic public space: the west steps. For generations, this plaza has been the literal and symbolic stage for civic engagement, where countless Californians from all walks of life have gathered to be heard. 
Despite verbal claims that plans for a partially above-ground visitor center have been dropped, current designs still call for digging up the west steps, lawn and plaza. Officials have refused to provide written guarantees these spaces will be protected.
In fact, the Legislature in June quietly passed a budget trailer bill to avoid providing a written guarantee to preserve the west plaza. It was the second time in three years  they changed state law to advance the project with a last-minute trailer bill. It shows a disturbing pattern of backdoor tactics to sidestep public accountability. 
The recent rollback of the California Environmental Quality Act is another nail in the coffin of public review. By fast-tracking politically favored projects and sidelining environmental and historic preservation oversight, the state’s CEQA reforms further erode transparency and deny Californians a voice in decisions reshaping public spaces.
The annex project has unfolded under a veil of secrecy unprecedented in state history. California needs a full, independent audit — one that digs deeper than surface-level accounting — to examine the contracts, scope, budget decisions and financial dealings behind this billion-dollar boondoggle.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders should direct the State Auditor to launch that review and pass legislation that permanently protects the west steps and plaza as a place for public assembly. 
Perhaps now, with more eyes on it and more lawmakers speaking out, there’s a chance to change the annex project’s course.  It’s not too late to restore trust, but doing so will take more than statements and symbolic gestures.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/042825-Capitol-Annex-FG-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)Amid turmoil within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and changes to COVID vaccine recommendations, one state legislative leader is calling on Nevada to take action.
The call comes after reports local public health agencies do not have the updated covid vaccine and private retail pharmacies in Nevada cannot administer it until further federal action is taken.
Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, a Democrat, on Thursday announced she has instructed legislative staff “to explore statutory and regulatory options to address this crisis.”
The options “could be considered at the first possible opportunity,” she added.
At CDC, worries mount that agency has taken anti-science turn

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week began recommending COVID boosters only for people 65 or older and others at high risk of complications. Meanwhile, the CDC has stopped recommending the vaccine for children and pregnant women.
Prior to these changes, COVID vaccines and boosters were more widely available and recommended for anyone 6 months and up.
CVS, the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chain, told the New York Times and other media outlets that it will not offer the updated COVID-19 vaccine at all in Nevada, Massachusetts and New Mexico. The company told KTNV it’s because of a state law limiting what vaccines pharmacists can administer to those approved by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The ACIP has not yet weighed in on the newest formulation, which like the flu shot is updated every year.
In 13 other states, CVS is offering the vaccine but requiring prescriptions.
Cannizzaro criticized President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for showing “reckless disregard for Nevadans’ health and well-being by baselessly changing the eligibility requirements for new COVID vaccines and making it nearly impossible for many Nevadans to receive them.”
The Nevada’s Public Employees Benefits Program on Thursday told members that a vaccine clinic scheduled for Friday would not have the COVID vaccine available. PEBP provides insurance for more than 71,000 people, including current and former public sector employees and their families.
The Southern Nevada Health District and Northern Nevada Public Health this week confirmed they do not have the updated COVID-19 vaccine.

 


				Northern Nevada Public Health on Thursday announced that Washoe County is experiencing “a concerning rise” in Pertussis, better known as whooping cough or the 100-day cough.
Eighteen confirmed or probable cases have been reported this year, as of late August, according to the release.
“Respiratory illness season doesn’t officially begin until October, yet we’ve already seen three times as many whooping cough cases this year as we did in all of last year,” said Dr. Chad Kingsley, the district health officer for NNPH.
Pertussis is preventable via widely available vaccinations that have been recommended by medical professionals for adolescents and adults since 2006 and since 1997 for children younger than 7.			




NNPH in a press release said it is “awaiting guidance” from the CDC’s ACIP “to determine a path forward in providing the updated COVID-19 vaccine.” The district anticipates the vaccine will be available “at the end of September or early October.”
The ACIP is scheduled to meet again on Sept. 18 and 19.
SNHD in its release said it “is preparing” to begin offering the updated COVID vaccine and will announce when it is available in its clinics. No time frame was given.
On Wednesday, SNHD announced it had the previous season’s COVID-19 vaccine available for eligible Nevadans who want it. The following day, the district walked back that offer, announcing in a release it had “received updated guidance” and would not be offering the previous formulation.
Dr. Cassius Lockett, the district health officer for SNHD, said in a statement that the health district “remains committed to providing COVID-19 vaccines to everyone who is eligible, including adults ages 65 and older and people with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for severe illness.”
SNHD noted that the updated vaccine can be provided before the CDC’s ACIP meets but cautioned that “people should be aware that insurance coverage may change once the committee issues its final recommendations.”
Kennedy over the summer gutted the ACIP, which for decades has made the vaccine recommendations followed by states. New members appointed by Kennedy include vaccine skeptics.
California, Oregon and Washington on Wednesday announced a public health alliance to coordinate their own vaccine recommendations.
The West Coast states — all led by Democratic governors — formed a similar alliance at the onset of the covid pandemic in 2020. That alliance also included Nevada, which was at the time led by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak.
(Meanwhile, Florida’s surgeon general this week stood alongside Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and announced the state would move to end all vaccine mandates for schoolchildren.)
Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican who ousted Sisolak in 2022, has called vaccines “positive” but said he is largely anti-mandate, saying it’s up to individuals to decide what is best for themselves and their children.
The Current has reached out to the governor for comment.
It’s unclear what, if anything, the Nevada State Legislature can do without the governor’s approval. Democrats control both chambers of the Legislature but not by the supermajorities required to overturn gubernatorial vetoes.
In Massachusetts — one of the other two states where CVS said it could not provide COVID vaccines — Democratic Gov. Maura Healey and state regulators have already taken action, including issuing an order allowing pharmacy workers to vaccinate.
The New Mexico Department of Health also issued a new health order instructing its Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.” Like Massachusetts, New Mexico is also headed by a Democrat, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
The Nevada State Legislature is not scheduled to meet until 2027 but Lombardo and Cannizzaro have both acknowledged that conversations about the prospect of a special session are happening behind the scenes.
Lombardo has said a special session might include his bills that failed to pass during the regular session earlier this year. He has also said that a proposed massive expansion of the film tax credit program is still on the table.
On her end, Cannizzaro has said the Legislature needs to address the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is already straining Nevada Medicaid and the state budget
Last week, following a massive ransomware attack that has brought multiple state systems and services to a grinding halt, Cannizzaro told the Current any special session should also include cybersecurity as a topic.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stkw5017-1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

(Photo by Jacques Julien/Getty Images)An online platform encouraging constituents across the country to make direct contact with their federal elected officials is ready to go local, starting in one of its best-performing states — Utah. 
5 Calls, a website and app that finds users’ representatives and senators in Congress and provides them with a phone number and a script to discuss some of the hottest issues on Capitol Hill, is now expanding to include members of the Utah statehouse in partnership with Elevate PAC.
On the list of federal issues, platform users in the state may now notice items with a red banner, marking state-wide issues. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One is titled “Investigate the Senate President’s Abuse of Power,” referring to reports of Utah Senate President Stuart Adams initiating legislation that later helped a family member reach a plea deal in a criminal case. Another one reads “Respect the Court, Respect the Voters: Don’t Appeal Utah’s Fair Maps Ruling,” about the legal fight happening in the state over congressional maps. 
“Utah’s a really interesting state for us, actually. It has really consistently, at the federal level, been in the top three states in terms of calls made to Congress per capita,” Nick O’Neill, technical director of 5 Calls said. 
For privacy reasons the organization doesn’t collect information about constituents who make calls via the platform. But, O’Neill imagines, one of the reasons Utahns are so engaged is because Republican lawmakers in the state “could sort of stand on their own, have an opinion of their own, and that’s a really interesting and unique feature in today’s political landscape.”
There’s no concrete information on users’ demographics in the state. The only existing data about engagement in Utah is on the volume of calls and the most popular issues among users.
In Utah, constituents reported over 2,280 calls in the last seven days, counting national hot buttons. The No. 1 issue recorded in the platform was a demand to release the Epstein case files. The second, was a call to impeach Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“Our community has been asking for state-level tools for years. Utah was the clear choice to launch, not just because people here are already using 5 Calls at such high levels, but because there is so much potential to shape the state’s future,” Rebecca Kaufman, executive director of 5 Calls, said in a statement.



Let us know what you think...


 


During the first couple of weeks of featuring local issues, Utahns have registered over 620 calls for state concerns, O’Neill said. The experience has also been different with state lawmakers, as many personally answer their phone calls, as opposed to delegating calls to a staffer.
In the partnership, Elevate PAC will bring on-the-ground perspective and explainers to help select issues that matter the most to Utahns, said Jackie Morgan, senior partner of the group. The goal, she said, is to see more contact between legislators and their constituents to inform decisions with more perspectives from their districts.
“We see so often in Utah, state lawmakers don’t listen to their constituents. We see committee hearings that are full of hundreds of people, and then the votes go exactly how we’d expect them to go,” Morgan said about the Utah Legislature’s Republican supermajority. 
And overall, Morgan said, the platform represents an opportunity for people in the state who may feel powerless to take political action, even without having lobbyists on payroll. 
“Instead of doomscrolling and getting frustrated and feeling powerless, you can actually do something about it,” she said. “We have had so many people reach out to us and say that they’ve contacted their representatives, and they’ve been shocked because their representative has just actually answered the phone.”
Most issues listed on the platform are progressive-leaning, O’Neill acknowledged. However, he emphasized 5 Calls is non-partisan and selects issues that are popular among the public regardless of political affiliation.
The platform has been testing the new system in other red states, like Texas, which just wrapped up a special legislative session that changed electoral boundaries, and Ohio, where lawmakers have to redraw congressional maps before the end of the year.
“We have been prioritizing important issues in states where they’ve come up. And I think it’s just happened that there have been a number of Republican legislature-controlled states that have started moving towards these sort of intentional gerrymanders,” O’Neill said, “which is what has come up as we’ve been able to have the technology to support this.”

The executive committee approved Azar's proposed benefit changes, which will be brought to the full board for a voter later this month.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)In the face of rising insurance rates, Alabama will have to consider allocating more money to the state employees’ health insurance program while altering state workers’ benefits, the State Employees’ Insurance Board leader said during a meeting Wednesday.
Stephanie Azar, CEO of the board, told members of the executive committee that without increased state support or benefit changes, the SEIB would gradually go into debt over the next three years.
“The board has known for some time that there would be difficult decisions coming due to the health care inflation and the issues we may face,” Azar said. “I will say that any changes or any decisions that will be made should not occur at one time, or even in one year, but will require the board to remain open to the pathway over the next several years to ensure the plan remains financially strong while maintaining excellent benefits for the members.”
Azar also recommended the board authorize a withdrawal from the Retirees’ Trust Fund to address funding shortfalls in the coming months. Withdrawals are limited to 10% of the trust’s fair market value on the last day of the previous fiscal year, Azar said, which was $304.7 million. She recommended pulling the maximum amount allowed, $30.4 million.
“I think that is not a good practice to pull from the trust, but I think that this board is going to have to pull from the trust,” Alabama Finance Director Bill Poole said.
Azar said the last time money was taken from the trust was in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, also to address funding shortfalls. She also recommended that the board withdraw 5% of the trust at the end of FY26 if needed.
Although the $30.4 million will help, Azar said the $30.4 million will only pay for about three weeks of expenses. 
“This was enlightening to me when I heard this, but SEIB spends a little over $10 million in a week,” Azar said.
The executive committee approved benefit changes to bring before the full board for a vote, including:

Major medical calendar year deductible (from $300 to $350)
Inpatient hospital stays (from $250 to $300 deductible, and from $25 to $50 copay)
Emergency room visits (from no copay to $250 copay excluding accidents and $300 copay including accidents)
Specialist and ER physician visits (from $35 copay to $40) 

Azar said the changes would save SEIB up to $6.2 million per year.
Connie Grier, an elected active employee representative, convinced the executive committee to reduce Azar’s initial recommendation for an increased specialist copay of $50 down to $40.
“I feel like $50 for a specialist is going to discourage some people from going to a specialist,” Grier said. “There are a whole lot of specialists. I think people are actually seeing more specialists now than what we used to 10 years ago.”
Azar said that benefit change was the biggest driver of savings in its original form at about $3.7 million per year. 
“It is still a very rich benefit program, even with benefit changes,” Azar said.
She also recommended increasing the per member per month rate from $1,025 to $1,175 for full-time employees, which the board will request from the Legislature when the 2026 legislative session begins in January. Azar said about 30% of the coverage is paid for by the state, $6% is from the employer, and 28% falls to the employee. The final funding decision will lay with legislators. 
Earlier Wednesday, the Public Education Employees Health Insurance Plan board approved a rate increase request.
“The point is: health care costs are going up everywhere,” Poole said.
Faye Nelson, who chairs SEIB, said she would support the changes the board sought, but that there would have to be changes to premiums.
“The reality is, it’s going to be more of a cost to our employees either now or later,” Nelson said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0420-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

(Photo by Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Washoe County Commission Chair Alexis Hill says if she’s elected governor of Nevada she’ll put an end to tax giveaways to billionaires such as Elon Musk. Washoe County, she noted, lacks the infrastructure to support Musk’s factories. 
“We know from the Governor’s Office of Economic Development that these do not pencil,” Hill, a Democrat, said Thursday at her gubernatorial campaign announcement in Las Vegas. “The juice isn’t worth the squeeze.” 
Attorney General Aaron Ford, also a Democrat, declared his candidacy in late July for the state’s top spot, and announced Thursday he’s raised more than $1.1 million since.   
Ford, who served as senate majority leader before his election as AG, voted in 2014 to approve a $1.3 billion tax incentive package for Musk’s Gigafactory in Storey County and in 2016 for $750 million in public funding for Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. 
Hill praised Ford, who she said “has committed his life to state service.” She said she’s running because she doesn’t think “the change that we need is actually happening. And so I’m not scared because the establishment has supported AG Ford.” 
The difference between herself and Ford is “I’m not afraid to tell you what I think. …  I believe in fighting Trump, but it’s more than just filing lawsuits against Trump,” she said, referring to Ford’s filings, in tandem with Democratic attorneys general from other states, against Trump’s initiatives such as ending birthright citizenship. 
“I’m more of a policy wonk than a bomb thrower,” said Hill, a Reno native who is serving her second term on the commission. 
Hill is largely unknown in Southern Nevada and acknowledges she is learning the issues, which she says appear to be similar to those in Washoe, “just bigger.” 
As local governments struggle to provide basic services, Hill says now is the time to start the process of tweaking the state’s property tax cap, which limits increases to 3% for a primary residence and 8% for a commercial property. 
Efforts to make even minor adjustments to the cap have failed. 
“I actually think that a lot of lawmakers want to see this happen and need someone to lead the charge,” she said.
Hill acknowledges her experience is confined to local government, where she worked as a planner before running for the commission. 
“I have been told that it is not my time to run for office and that I need to wait my turn,” Hill said, adding she considers her lack of service in state government to be an asset. “I am closer to the people. I am a fed-up mom. I know Nevada can be better.”
In addition to ending tax giveaways to the wealthy, Hill promised to: 

tax corporate investments as assets;
reset property tax upon sale “to ensure people are paying their fair share when they come into our community;”
impose temporary caps on rent;
ensure companies that employ electric vehicles and pay no gas tax, such as Amazon and Tesla, contribute to road construction and maintenance; and, 
get the unhoused the help they need. “The federal funding is not going to be coming to us anymore,” she said.  

Hill characterized Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s $100 million housing initiative, which is intended to subsidize market rate housing for homebuyers earning up to 150% of area median income, as a “drop in the bucket for the real construction costs that it takes to build housing.” 
By capturing tax revenue lost to “folks who are taking advantage of tax controls in our state,” governments can do more at the local and state levels. 
Hill says she supports Sen. Jacky Rosen’s plan to release federal land for housing in Northern Nevada because it conserved sensitive lands. She says she “believes in infill,” which she considers critical to achieving the density required to make mass transit work. 
She says she’s campaigned on a platform of workforce housing, but has taken heat from some residents of Lake Tahoe’s Incline Village and Crystal Bay communities, who say her support for greater density, on the commission and as a member of the Tahoe Regional Planning Authority, is exacerbating water quality issues, supplanting affordable housing with luxury development, and increasing the threat of an evacuation disaster in the event of a wildfire. 
Some Tahoe residents say they are considering filing a lawsuit against Washoe County, which last week adopted housing amendments approved by TRPA.
“I don’t even know if these code amendments will get as much housing as we need,” Hill said. “But it’s a start, and I don’t want to just sit around and do nothing.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AF5AC6F7-0C74-46A3-978D-3F0DBF0F1ECC-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434
,California,2025-09-05 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,San Mateo County lawsuit exposes California’s penchant for state budgeting tricks,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/california-budget-san-mateo-lawsuit/,The tools and tricks employed to close California's budget deficits come from an inventory of techniques developed over decades. A recent lawsuit spotlighted a strategy used in 2004.,"California has a sorry history of shortsighted state budgets, leading to periodic crises when revenues fall short of matching spending due to economic slowdowns or fanciful expectations. The current budget, enacted in June, is one example.
Three years ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus, based on what turned out to be revenue projections about $40 billion a year higher than reality. The phantom surplus spawned big increases in spending that could not be sustained.
The 2025-26 general fund budget has an actual $20 billion gap between income and outgo that’s being covered by dipping into emergency reserves, accounting gimmicks and on- and off-the-books borrowing. Moreover, both administration and legislative budget advisors believe that a “structural deficit” will be felt indefinitely.
The tools and tricks being employed to close the current budget’s gap come from an inventory of techniques that fiscal insiders have developed over several decades and given monikers, such as double-flip, triple-flip and ERAF, that only veterans of the Capitol’s incessant money battles understand.
ERAF stands for Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and was created 33 years ago, during Republican Gov. Pete Wilson’s first term, to help him and legislators deal with a recession-caused budget deficit. They diverted billions of dollars in property taxes from local governments to school districts through the augmentation fund, thereby reducing the state’s constitutional obligation to finance education and closing the state budget deficit.
Although local governments had to eat a major reduction in revenue, Wilson and legislators later made it up — more or less — with proceeds of a new sales tax, although restricting the money to police and fire services.
Similar maneuvers have been used to cover subsequent budget pinches, including one that newly elected Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger employed in 2004 to help fill a major hole in the budget he inherited after Gray Davis was recalled by voters.
The 2004 scheme included shifting another $1.3 billion in local property taxes to schools and eliminating local governments’ historic share of vehicle license fees. In return for giving up license revenue, local agencies would receive annual payments from the state calculated on a formula based on property tax growth.
In essence, these property tax and vehicle fee shifts are loans. Local officials have complained for years that the state’s promises of repayment have fallen short of covering the lost revenues by many billions of dollars.
The ongoing conflict entered a new phase last month when San Mateo County sued the state, alleging that it had been shorted the money it should have received from the 2004 license shift due to a quirk in the way San Mateo’s school districts are financed.
Several of the county’s school systems are designated as “basic aid,” meaning they receive only token amounts of state funds because local property taxes completely finance their operations, thanks to having high taxable property values. That, San Mateo contends, unfairly bent the formula used to calculate its vehicle license reimbursement.
The county pegs the shortfall at $38 million, and says it would have been even higher under the state’s original calculation but was partially modified after complaints.
“These funds are owed to San Mateo County and our 20 cities,” County Executive Mike Callagy said in a statement. “And instead of living up to its obligations, the state wants us to absorb the cost.”
While the amount at stake in the suit is relatively small, it represents the much larger rift between state and local officials, and exemplifies the convoluted ways the state has continued to paper over its shaky finances rather than squarely face them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/030825_San_Mateo_Sheriff_JK_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: More CT families slipping toward poverty,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/ct-families-poverty-report/,"About 40% of Connecticut households couldn’t afford basic needs in 2023, United Way found, and poverty is growing fastest outside urban areas.","A record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget in 2023, according to a new analysis from the United Way of Connecticut.
And while more than 60% of families in Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford and other poor cities fall below this threshold, poverty now is growing the fastest outside of urban centers.
The United Way on Friday released its annual poverty assessment based on its ALICE methodology. An acronym for Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained [and] Employed, ALICE is an alternative to the longstanding Federal Poverty Level, a metric increasingly criticized by policymakers as outdated and misleading.
The United Way estimates it cost a family of four — two parents and two children — $116,000 to cover basic survival needs, including food, housing, utilities, child and health care and transportation in 2023.
For a single parent with one child, the projected survival budget two years ago was $69,000.
The ALICE methodology assumes these families cannot afford a computer but rely only on a smart phone to meet all information technology needs.
Minimum earnings to cover a survival budget rose about 9% from 2021 to 2023 while the number of ALICE households has grown almost 17% since 2019.
“The number of ALICE households has really ticked up pretty meaningfully since 2019,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way’s Connecticut chapter. “That’s not the direction any of us want to see this going.”
Most of the largest increases have occurred in the state’s rural eastern half and in the suburbs surrounding cities. For example, the share of ALICE households in New Milford, a suburb north of Danbury, grew from 26% in 2019 to 44% in 2023.
“The idea of people struggling is not limited to any one part of our state, and, in fact, is getting worse in parts of our state [that] might like to think that they are somehow safe from this, this epidemic of financial need,” Bates said.
The new report also underlines Connecticut’s longstanding income inequality along racial and ethnic lines.
While 34% of white households and 31% of Asian households were below the ALICE threshold, other groups faced greater rates of hardship. These include:

Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 63% 
Hispanic, 59% 
American Indian Alaska native, 59% 
Black, 56% 
Two or more races, 49% 

The ALICE calculations represent an alternative to the Federal Poverty Level, a simple metric developed in the mid-1960s by U.S. Social Security Administration economists and based largely on the cost of a minimum food diet. A family of four earning more than $30,000 was considered above the poverty line in 2023. A family of two had to make just $19,720.
The Urban Institute, a nonprofit economic and social policy research group based in Washington, D.C., echoed the United Way’s ALICE conclusions last December.
The institute reported a family of four in the northeastern U.S. needed to earn close to $151,100 in 2022 to be economically secure. Its True Cost of Economic Security measure evaluates adequate food, clothing, housing, health care, child care, transportation, postsecondary education, debt service, savings for unexpected expenses and retirement, and additional miscellaneous costs.
“The [federal] poverty line tells you very little about who is struggling in your community,” Bates said. “It tells you about who is suffering the most. It does not tell you who is the whole of that universe of people trying to make those basic tasks, month to month.”
The United Way, which has been presenting ALICE projections since 2014, initially encountered surprise and resistance from state officials and others when it reported a survival cost far above the Federal Poverty Level, Bates said. 
But once skeptics review the ALICE budget component-by-component, Bates added, “every single time, not kidding, 100% of the time, people will have said, ‘That number’s too low.’”
Critics of the ALICE projections and similar calculations note Connecticut’s social safety net, on average, is far more generous than those offered in most other states.
But Connecticut’s investments in these areas, relative to inflation, have been slipping for more than a decade as state officials prioritize reducing the huge pension debt the state amassed between 1939 and 2010. 
Connecticut, which entered this past fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension obligations, has dedicated $8.6 billion captured by savings programs into the pensions since 2020 and is expected to deposit close to another $2.5 billion this fall.
Meanwhile, a legislative leadership plan to dramatically boost payments to doctors who treat poor patients on Medicaid was scaled back dramatically.
Connecticut hadn’t raised Medicaid reimbursement rates in a broad-based fashion since 2007, leaving many insured patients unable to find physicians who will treat them. Leaders said a $250 million infusion in this area is needed to make a big difference and pledged to get there in four years, starting with $75 million in extra Medicaid spending this fiscal year.
But because of budget caps and savings rules, that $75 million investment ultimately was scaled back to just $15 million.
Similarly, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities says state education aid to cities and towns — once adjusted for inflation — effectively is down more than $400 million per year since Gov. Ned Lamont took office in 2019, forcing increasing property tax hikes at the local level.
Advocates for low- and middle-income households say one of the best ways to assist families in or slipping into poverty is to create a new per-child credit within the state income tax. The United Way is among those spearheading a push for a $600-per-child credit – with a maximum of $1,800 – for single-parent households making less than $100,000 and couples under $200,000. 
The credit, which analysts have estimated would cost the state $300 million to $350 million per year, also would be refundable. That means even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to apply the credit to, it would have $600 per child added to its refund. 
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has been resistant to a child tax credit. The administration says the governor prefers to offer tax breaks that reach a broader range of households than the roughly 270,000 that would qualify for a per-child benefit.
The governor last year proposed boosting another income tax credit that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills from $300 to $350, and broadening eligibility. But while Lamont’s plan would have benefited about 800,000 filers, it only would have distributed about $85 million or one-quarter of the total relief proposed for the child tax credit.
Lamont and the Democratic-controlled legislature in 2023 adopted one of the largest income tax cuts in state history, returning about $460 million, chiefly to middle-class households this year. Most families received about $300 extra.
But many legislators have said that, since income taxes are rarely reduced, the claim of the largest cut in state history is misleading. That relief, they say, has been too modest given inflation and eroding municipal aid and core state programs.
Congress and President Donald Trump recently ordered big cuts in aid to Connecticut and other states for health care, food stamps and other programs, Bates noted, adding many families here likely will continue to lose ground over the next few years. A $600-per-child credit, while costing just a fraction of recent state surpluses, could lift thousands of households above the desperation level.
“Legislators, I think, understand that if you are interested in talking about the people in your district scraping by paycheck to paycheck,” she added, “this [ALICE report] is the data that you want to pay attention to.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_057-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

Let’s take a look.
Ole Miss at Kentucky, 2:30 p.m. 
The 2024 Ole Miss season likely always will be remembered for what might have been. And what might have been was this: The Rebels, led by first-round NFL draft pick Jaxson Dart, should have played in the first 12-team College Football Playoffs. They were talented enough with a school record eight players taken in the NFL’s seven-round draft. That was more than the likes of Notre Dame, Clemson, Penn State, SMU, Boise State and Indiana — all teams that made the playoffs. That was also more than traditional powerhouses such as Alabama, LSU, Michigan, Florida, Southern Cal and Miami.

Rick Cleveland
Of course, Ole Miss did not make the playoffs, and the 2025 Rebels on Saturday will face probably the primary reason the 2024 Rebels didn’t make it: Kentucky. In retrospect, that home defeat to Kentucky, which was a 17-point underdog, ranks as one of the biggest upsets of the 2024 college football season. After somehow defeating No. 6 Ole Miss 20-17 on Sept. 28, Kentucky lost its last six games against FBS teams. Most weren’t close. 
Defeating Kentucky on Saturday — and the Rebels are 9.5-point favorites to do so — won’t exorcise last year’s demon; however, it would be a first step toward making the playoffs this season. It also will provide a first SEC start, on the road, for Ole Miss sophomore quarterback Austin Simmons, who appears to these eyes potentially every bit as good as Dart. Yes, that is sky-high praise, but Simmons appears to have it all: the arm, the smarts, the speed. He appears to throw the football with the ease of throwing a baseball, and you can’t say that about a lot of quarterbacks. Yes, he made a couple of poor decisions in the opener against Georgia State, but he is 19 years young. Saturday should provide a big step in his maturing process.
Kentucky? Kentucky is a question mark, the case with so many college football teams in this transfer portal era. The Wildcats overhauled their squad with 24 transfers, including quarterback Zach Calzada and running back Dante Dowdell, the former Picayune superstar, who is making his third stop in three seasons of college football. Dowdell, who signed with Oregon and transferred to Nebraska as a sophomore, led Kentucky to its opening victory over Toledo with 129 yards and a touchdown on just 14 carries. Dowdell, who packs 227 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame, will challenge the Rebels’ retooled defensive front.
Simply put, Ole Miss needs to take care of business. Stopping Dowdell and forcing Calzada to throw is the first order of that business. Calzada, making his fourth collegiate stop in his seventh year of college football, completed 10 of 23 passes for just 85 yards against Toledo.
Jackson State at Southern Miss, 4 p.m.
Southern Miss is a 7.5-point favorite, but don’t think for a second T.C. Taylor’s JSU Tigers don’t expect to win. And why wouldn’t they? The Tigers have now won 11 straight games. Meanwhile, Southern Miss has lost 11 straight. Jackson State has won those 11 straight by an average margin of 23 points. Southern Miss has lost those 11 straight by 25 points a game. At first glance, you ask yourself: How can USM be favored?
Yes, there is a difference in competition. FBS team such as Southern Miss can offer as many as 85 scholarships. JSU, which plays at the FCS level, can offer 63 scholarships, each of which can be split among multiple players. Theoretically, USM should have more depth. But then, Taylor says the Tigers are a solid two-deep at every position, and I haven’t heard Charles Huff, USM’s new head coach, say the same.
Huff has had nothing but praise this week for JSU, which defeated Huff’s alma mater, Hampton, 28-14 last Saturday. “Winning cures a lot and they have won,” Huff said. “Their players expect to win, their fan base expects to win … It’s gonna be a challenge. We need to improve quickly.”
To these eyes, Southern Miss appeared an improved team, although it was overmatched at the line of scrimmage last Saturday against Mississippi State. The biggest difference is at the quarterback position, where multi-talented Braylon Braxton should give the Golden Eagles a chance to win any game remaining on the schedule. Of course, until they prove differently, the Eagles also could lose any game remaining on the schedule, including this one. Expect a near-sellout crowd, a terrific atmosphere and a highly competitive contest. 
Arizona State at Mississippi State, 6:30 p.m.
Oddsmakers make Arizona State a 6.5-point favorite in what could be a statement game for Mississippi State. The statement? “We’re back!”
We will see. But I saw enough last Saturday to believe State is much improved over last season, especially at the line of scrimmage. State is huge — and can move — on both sides of the ball. Blake Shapen, a top-shelf quarterback, is healthy after sitting out the last eight games of 2024. Do not forget that the 24-year-old Shapen four years ago quarterbacked Baylor to a Big 12 Conference championship and was the MVP of a 21-16 championship victory over Oklahoma State. Shapen completed a record 17 straight passes in that one.
Clearly, Shapen can play, and he played well early last season in a 30-23 road loss to Arizona State. Led by irrepressible running back Cam Skattebo, who rushed for 262 yards and broke seemingly that many tackles, the Sun Devils staved off a fourth quarter State rally. Arizona State went on to an 11-victory season and the NCAA playoffs. You know what happened to State.
But a Mississippi State victory Saturday night would not shock this writer for any number of reasons, including that Skattebo, who pretty much single-handedly whipped State last year, now plays for the New York Giants. Other reasons:

Arizona State was far from impressive in its 38-19 opening week victory over Northern Arizona.
Arizona State is 0-2 all-time playing on the road against SEC teams and 1-6 overall against the SEC.
State has covered the spread in its last four games against ranked teams. The Bulldogs are due to win one of those.

It’s hard to overstate how important this game is for State, mostly because of how difficult the schedule becomes down the road. Beginning Sept. 27, the Bulldogs finish the season, in order, against Tennessee, Texas A&M, Florida, Texas, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri and Ole Miss. Good luck with that.
Reaching six victories and a bowl game would be a huge step forward for Jeff Lebby and his Bulldogs. It’ll be hard to find six without one of those coming this Saturday.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04151907/AP25243056487570.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-05 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Meet the unlikely pair behind an ousted Hinds County supervisor’s election heist allegations,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/05/meet-the-unlikely-pair-behind-an-ousted-hinds-county-supervisors-election-heist-allegations/,"Three years ago, Cynthia Walker and Marilyn Hetrick didn’t know the ousted Hinds County supervisor from Adam. Today, they're battling what they allege is a hijacked election process.","Cynthia Walker said she was 15 years old when she participated in her first ballot box review — reconciling the number of ballots with poll book entries and taking a count of everything, down to the number of rubber bands in each box.
She claimed her findings, recorded in handwritten notes on a yellow legal pad, led to a landmark election challenge for a Black supervisor 50 miles north of Jackson. The 67-year-old Yazoo City resident said she’s taken part in dozens of these examinations since then.
So when Walker saw former Hinds County Supervisor David Archie in the news in the summer of 2023, incredulous that he’d lost reelection in a smackdown by a political newcomer, she thought to herself, “I know what happened to him,” Walker told Mississippi Today. “I’m going to reach out to him.”
Two days later, Walker appeared beside Archie at a press conference outside the sheriff’s office to decry an alleged “high-tech” conspiracy involving a former election commissioner and voting machine company. She stood 5-foot, wearing a short tapered haircut, jewel dotted shades and a pastel yellow pantsuit.
“She’s a little bitty person, but she has the power of a giant coming out of her,” said Marilyn Hetrick, a 75-year-old Clinton resident, retired assistant personnel director for the city of Jackson, and one of Archie’s staunchest supporters.
Three years ago, Walker and Hetrick didn’t know each other — or the ousted supervisor, for that matter — from Adam. 
It was a curious time to become an ally of Archie, who’d become widely defined by his antics, such as a profanity-filled fit during a 2021 supervisor’s meeting. As officers removed him, he tore down the plexiglass partitions on the dias. This behavior, according to his supporters, has all been in the name of drawing attention to corruption in the county.
But the two retired women have teamed up in the last two years to fight what they call a calculated election heist. The alleged proof?
Missing voter signature books. Improperly sealed ballot boxes. Commingled election machine hard drives. A post-election Facebook message from the chair of the Democratic Executive Committee reading, “I’m f—ing David Archie on site !!!” 
This spawned a lawsuit, crafted from Hetrick’s suburban kitchen, exhibits strewn across her banquette, with Walker on speed dial from up north near the edge of the Mississippi Delta.

“It was a radical departure from election laws. It was gross misconduct. It was illegal and immoral and disrespectful. It was voter disenfranchisement,” Walker said on the steps of the courthouse last week, Hetrick behind her.
“You just cannot ‘have it your way,’ like you’re at Burger King, when you’re processing election materials,” Walker added.
Even the harshest critics of Hinds County elections, such as former longtime Hinds County Republican Party chairman Pete Perry, say the challenge is baloney. Procedural irregularities alone do not demonstrate fraud, and they’re not likely to nullify a wide-margin outcome, experts said.
“I don’t think they ran a good election. I don’t believe they ran it legally,” Perry said. “I also don’t believe they did a damn thing that affected 1,800 votes. It’s not possible.”
On the day of the deadline for Archie’s petition for judicial review of the election in September of 2023, Hetrick said her fingers were practically bleeding from all the typing. Then at about 10 a.m., Archie received a call from Supervisor Robert Graham: The county had just experienced a cyber attack. The circuit clerk’s office cleared out for the day.
“My heart just dropped,” Hetrick said. 
Archie went down to the courthouse anyway, manilla folder in hand, and recorded videos in front of the locked glass doors to the unlit, empty office, according to his recent Facebook post. 
Still, Hinds County Circuit Clerk Zack Wallace — who was initially named as a defendant in the lawsuit — testified that his office was open that day, and Archie took no additional steps to file, meaning he’d missed his deadline. The judge agreed.
Thus ensued a two-year battle over whether the office was open or closed, culminating in over a dozen subpoenas and a packed courtroom hearing on Aug. 27, featuring a who’s who of county powerbrokers.
The special judge appointed to hear the case, retired Circuit Court Judge Barry Ford, reversed his original ruling that dismissed the case, allowing Archie’s lawsuit to proceed. 
“Today’s ruling was a win for our case to restore election integrity,” Hetrick wrote on Facebook later that day. “Those who intentionally disregarded election law and protocol must be held accountable as a deterrent to others who might try this in the future.”
One morning in the fall of 2022, a recently widowed Hetrick struck up a conversation with a tall, broad fellow with a slick head while walking on the track at the Baptist Healthplex near her home in Clinton. 
He was friendly, calm and knowledgeable, she said. Hetrick asked the man what he did for a living. “I work for government,” he said. What branch? “County.” What position? “I’m a supervisor.”
Which supervisor? “I’m David Archie,” he said.
Hetrick was floored. This wasn’t the loud-mouthed politician she was used to reading about in the news, whose opponent she actively supported years earlier.
Hetrick asked him about his boardroom blow-ups, which he described as a statement, a method of getting people to care about their local government’s dysfunction. After Hetrick vetted her new friend with her former coworkers from City Hall, Archie took her on rides-along to show her the progress he’s made in the county — the things he says the media never broadcasts.
“I started to understand where he was coming from,” Hetrick said.

Hetrick lives just outside of Archie’s district, in an area that was represented by Archie’s main foe on the board, former Supervisor Credell Calhoun. The two men hadn’t always been at odds.
Calhoun, a businessman and former auditor in the governor’s office, told Mississippi Today he supported Archie’s campaign for supervisor in 2019. When Archie won narrowly and it looked like there may be a challenge to that election, Calhoun said the board of supervisors directed all of its state road funding to Archie’s district, District 2, to ingratiate voters to Archie in the event there was a rematch. 
When that didn’t happen, Calhoun said the board took half of the money back to divvy up across the county, angering Archie. “We were trying to help him so much and then he turned,” Calhoun said.
Archie refutes this, saying the board directed the funding to his district because it had been neglected for several years. Archie has repeatedly accused Calhoun of misspending public money and impeding county progress, which Calhoun denies. He calls Calhoun a “40-year con man,” and Hetrick parrots.
So when the county’s Democratic Party primary rolled around the next year, Hetrick spent most of her energy supporting the candidate Archie’s camp preferred against Calhoun, former state representative Deborah Dixon. Dixon and Calhoun had similar contention, and she ran against the incumbent after she said he backed the candidate who knocked her out of the Legislature in 2019.
Hetrick served as a poll watcher — her first time in the role — for Dixon. At the election watch party that evening, Hetrick celebrated her candidate’s victory but was stunned by her friend Archie’s loss.

Archie had lost convincingly to Anthony Smith, the owner of a computer maintenance company and a real estate firm, by nearly 2-to-1. Smith, regarded by some as “somebody nobody knew,” took home more votes in 25 out of 26 precincts in the district. The total count was 2,810 for Archie and 4,687 for Smith. 
Plenty of residents were unsurprised by Archie’s ouster after all of the bickering. After all, voters shook up more than half of the board – including voting out Calhoun and a third incumbent. But Archie and his team were taken aback.
“Something just doesn’t feel right and we’re trying to figure it out,” Archie told Hetrick when she called him later that night.
Cue Walker. 
The retired paralegal, who’s since opened her home to shelter homeless families, had run as an independent for mayor of Yazoo City in 2022 and lost, receiving just 5% of the vote. 
Walker publicly alleges her election, and others in Yazoo, were rigged, the work of a Jackson-based election consultant named Toni Johnson. 
This is where Walker claims to have found a pattern: She alleges Johnson “came into Yazoo City blazing” starting during the 2018 municipal elections. Walker paints a vague picture of Johnson being in cahoots with the election machine techs and having special access to the computers. And that the candidates Johnson works for always win.
“She went to the highest bidder,” Archie said.
This connection is a handy detail for the Archie camp because Johnson previously served as a Hinds County Election Commissioner, where she found herself in Archie’s crosshairs. She’d also run against him for the supervisor seat in 2019.
Archie accused Johnson of pocketing county money in 2021, WJTV reported, and in early 2022, the auditor’s office arrested her for allegedly defrauding the government by using pandemic relief funds to purchase a television for her home and issuing no-show contracts for services including voting machine audits.
In the 2022 Yazoo City election, Walker alleged Johnson attended the ballot examination wearing her ankle monitor. Johnson pleaded guilty to embezzlement related to the flat screens in 2023 and stepped down from the commission. 
Later that year, after forming a nonprofit called We Must Vote, Johnson consulted Smith’s campaign against Archie. 
“She was very effective in helping me and, you know, I don’t judge anybody,” Smith told Mississippi Today. “I think she’s still a beautiful person.”
Archie’s team hasn’t provided evidence, or a description of evidence, to support allegations of election machine tampering. But Walker did proclaim during the post-election press conference that Johnson’s “blueprint, her DNA, her blood is all over the stealing, the roguishness and the thieving of elections in Mississippi.”
Johnson’s attorney Lisa Ross spoke at the event: “Show us one machine Toni Johnson has touched. She has touched none,” Ross said.
Archie vowed to bring his information to the county district attorney, the attorney general, the secretary of state and the FBI. 
“It is unbelievable that she (Johnson) runs around throwing her weight around because it’s our understanding there’s a real big fish,” Archie said at the 2023 press conference, holding his hands at the distance of a walleye, “that is behind her and protecting her.”
Archie repeated the “big fish” line to Mississippi Today during the reporting of this story, but would not elaborate, saying “you’ll soon find out.”
About a week after the press conference, the resolution board was still working to canvas the absentee ballots to determine which were legally cast and should be accepted. Democratic primary elections, which often determine the winner in Hinds County, are overseen by the Hinds County Democratic Executive Committee.
Jacquie Amos, then-chair of the committee, explained to Mississippi Today that some voters fill out absentee votes on ballots printed on regular paper, which cannot be fed through the machine. Resolution board members, trained by the committee, must transfer the votes to scannable ballots.
So if someone walked into the courthouse basement that day, one week after the election, this is what they’d see: Tables of people bubbling in hundreds of fresh ballots. 
Archie, joined by supporters, did just that, and things got heated. 
“You don’t really know what they’re doing, marking one ballot to another,” said Dixon, who was there to follow her own race.
Amos said she went down to the basement to try to explain the procedure to onlookers, since “no one knows the process, they always think something is wrong,” she said.
Perry was there, too, and said workers should have been looking over the board’s shoulder but weren’t — an account Amos rejects. Local activist Addie Lee Green, who was attempting to observe workers behind the counter in the clerk’s office, said the election officials attempted to call the sheriff to escort her out.
In addition to Dixon, Archie had backed Malcolm Johnson, former county special projects manager and talk show host, in another supervisors race. 
“He said, ‘Jacquie, we’re not going to let you steal this election from Deb or Malcolm,’” Amos said. “I turned around and said, ‘Are you kidding me?’”
Someone had to hold Amos back from a physical altercation. She said she was fuming when she left the courthouse to cool off and received a Facebook message, “Hey, don’t let them cheat Debroha (sic) Dixon out of her election. She won fair and square.”
“She won,” Amos responded. “But I’m f—ing David Archie on site !!!”
Amos said she’d already been on the outs with the supervisor. She said she’d incensed Archie when she refused — in response to many pleas — to run against Calhoun. Archie said that’s not true.
Soon, her profane Facebook message — which became exhibit E in Archie’s lawsuit — would appear in news outlets across the metro, though she said Mississippi Today was the first to call her for her side. 

Exhibit E in former Hinds County Supervisor David Archie’s election challenge.
Amos said she was disappointed Archie would use the message, composed in a heated moment, to paint her as corrupt, especially because she grew up with him as a kid. 
Amos’ father, a basketball and baseball coach at the now-defunct Hinds County Agricultural High School in Utica, had been Archie’s mentor before he passed. Her father campaigned door-to-door for Archie and was “crazy about him,” Amos said.
“‘If Daddy were here, David would not be acting that way.’ Mama says that all the time,” Amos said.
All of the drama is hurtful in more ways than one.
“What it does, in my opinion, is make voters stay away from the process,” Amos said. “People won’t vote. They say, ‘There’s corruption.’”
After the dust up in the basement, and the committee officially certified the election, Archie asked Cynthia and Hetrick to help with his ballot box review — the process a candidate must undergo in order to challenge the results.
Hetrick accepted the offer, thinking it probably wouldn’t bear fruit, but at least she could help her friend accept his loss. Until she saw inside the boxes.
In the election commission’s fluorescently lit office in late August of 2023, two white top folding tables sat end to end. Wallace, the circuit clerk, brought the election contents, the soft blue boxes carrying ballots and precinct materials, into the room so Archie’s camp could conduct its examination.
Walker was the leader, joined by Hetrick, advertising specialist Taylor Turcotte, Turcotte’s friend and Green, a former Bolton alderwoman and a frequent unsuccessful statewide candidate.
What happened in that room is a matter of perspective. Smith, who brought a campaign supporter known only to him by his alias “Eyes”, sat across the table from the women, filming videos of them on his phone. 
Walker described a tense scene, a gaggle of “grown rusty men that were on the attack, that ran interference, that cussed and screamed and threatened to fight.”
Turcotte’s friend was so uncomfortable that she didn’t come back after the first day. “They didn’t grow up in the hood like me,” Walker said. 
Smith rejected this telling, insisting all he did was “watch them very closely.” But Turcotte said Smith’s unblinking, “cold, dead stare” actually made her fear for Archie’s safety. At one point, a scrap nearly broke out, three of the women said.
“That’s how they pick fights with David is they get up in his face and they insult him, and then he gets loud to overwhelm them. And then David looks like the ass,” Turcotte said.
Hetrick, a devout Catholic, began arriving at the commission with her rosary wrapped around her wrist. Walker, who carried pepper spray, made a joke that Hetrick should bring holy water.
The next day, Hetrick said she brought her tiny white plastic bottle, embellished with a gold cross, and sprinkled the chairs around the table before Smith arrived that morning. The tiffs subsided after that, Hetrick said.
What disturbed the women more than the intimidating environment was what they said they found — or didn’t find — inside the boxes.
Each of the precinct boxes contained paper ballots, the petition states.
But the team alleges they found no machine tapes, the print-outs containing the number of votes scanned. They allegedly determined that all of the precinct media sticks, the hard drives that contain the digital record of the vote, were commingled in a bag with no seal, stashed in a commissioner’s desk in an open cubicle.
They alleged that out of 26 precincts, the boxes contained only eight receipt books, where voters record their signature when they sign in to vote, five ballot accounting forms, which show the number of ballots used and left over, and one machine key. 
This was after seven days of review.
“Everything was stored in all kinds of different places illegally but nobody cared,” said Turcotte, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican against U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson in 2024 and for an open seat on the Jackson City Council in 2025.
The team alleges there’s no way to determine how many people actually voted in the election due to the illegal maintenance of the records. 
“If Mr. Smith won, why will they not allow us to validate his win?” Walker said.
Amos said she didn’t know of any documents that were missing, and if the materials weren’t in their designated precinct boxes, it would have been because the commissioners had already started cleaning the boxes out to prepare for a runoff. The records should be stored together in the commission’s office, Amos said.
“I am not Olivia Pope and this is not Defiance,” Amos said.
The committee voted Amos out in 2024, replacing her with Clinton alderman James Lott, a director at Hinds Community College. She left the committee altogether and now serves as the chair of the committee for the 2nd Congressional District. Lott told Mississippi Today his goal is to advance integrity in Hinds County elections through proper pollworker training and giving equal treatment to any complaints.
“Everything deserves to be heard and investigated,” Lott said.
Through an attorney, the Hinds County Election Commission did not respond to Archie’s allegations or answer questions about the current status or whereabouts of the materials. 
Because the commissioners will make up the tribunal that offers recommendations to the judge deciding Archie’s case, commission attorney Ray Chambers said they have a responsibility not to respond to press inquiries prior to trial. The only filings from defendants in the lawsuit so far argue Archie submitted past the deadline and avoid any explanation or alternative to the claims Archie laid out.
Perry said his experience is that the laws around election procedure — such as chain of custody, storage of materials and ensuring they are sealed — are frequently disregarded in Hinds County. But it’s inconceivable to him that 18 signature books have vanished.
“I’ll bet my ranch on the fact that the sign-in books exist,” he said.

Mississippi Today requested to inspect the books, but Chambers said state law requires that when a challenge arises, the materials are kept under seal until the court hearing.
Perry, who has conducted dozens of ballot box examinations and testified as an expert in election challenges, was present at the commission’s office for some of Archie’s review. He said he observed the team talking back and forth; it didn’t look to him like they knew what they were doing.
“There wasn’t anything to be gained by where they were spending their time,” he said. “All they did was make a scene to say, ‘We spent a week down there.’”
Archie’s lawsuit itself does not allege that the paper ballots he reviewed were forged. It doesn’t utter ballot stuffing or vote buying.
“As a kid in the 60s, I saw it done,” Perry said. “That’s where everybody was marking paper ballots and putting it in a box. And at the end of the day, they’re sitting there, late at night underneath a light hanging from a single cord above a table in an old closed grocery store.”
But that’s not how it works anymore. Today, votes are counted by a scanner instead of by hand. When ballots are printed, there’s a record attached to verify how many are used and left over. The receipt books record how many people entered the polls through their signature. In the poll books, election workers mark on a roster of registered voters, recording who voted. Both of these may be matched to the number on the machine or the number of paper ballots. 
Mistakes do happen, particularly with affidavit and absentee votes, and can make a difference in a slim margin race when challenged.
But fabricating ballots in the hundreds, let alone thousands, in theory would require a multi-person conspiracy and a kind of sophistication that all evidence shows Hinds County officials do not possess, Perry said.

“You can’t manufacture that kind of vote. The system has too many checks and balances in it to do it,” Perry said.
That doesn’t mean Hinds County elections don’t have problems. 
Bridgette Morgan, a candidate in the 2024 election for Hinds County Court Judge, brought a challenge after losing in a runoff last November. In the first race of three candidates, she received nearly enough votes, shy just 9, to win outright.
Morgan alleged that irregularities were to blame for her not being declared the winner. She was unsuccessful in getting a jury to agree with her in July, and she told Mississippi Today she plans to appeal. (Morgan’s challenge was for a general election, so a regular panel of jurors was responsible for deciding the case).
Perry said he’s repeatedly told Hinds County officials that if they don’t start following the laws around securing and storing ballots and maintaining proper accounting, a close election will soon enough result in a new election, costing the county an extra $100,000.
“Because in a close election, the way that they’re ignoring the law, refusing to even pretend to follow the law, it’s going to get overturned,” Perry said. “Now, David Archie’s is not a close election.”
Both Hetrick and Walker refute Perry’s analysis. Hetrick said he lacks imagination; Walker said if he knows of repeating violations, he should have done something about it by now.
In the case of suspected outright election or voter fraud, a local district attorney, the attorney general’s office or the U.S. Attorney’s Office may step in.
But most of the election laws Archie’s lawsuit alleged were broken — those related to controlling the contents of precinct boxes, sealings, receipt book storing, the process for examining affidavits — do not come with criminal penalties for violations, leaving few avenues for prosecutors.
Reached about Archie’s claims, a secretary of state’s office spokesperson said simply that the state office has no involvement in the matter. The attorney general’s office confirmed to Mississippi Today it had an active investigation into Morgan’s case, but not Archie’s.
So what’s the recourse? In Mississippi, virtually the only way to address a complaint over the handling of an election is for a failed candidate to file a challenge with the qualifying body in the race — in Archie’s case, the Democratic Executive Committee. If that doesn’t work, a candidate can petition the court for judicial review. 
The losing candidate must have the money to hire a lawyer. In these cases, the proper defendant is the winning candidate, not the officials who were responsible for running a fair election. 
In the course of one of these lawsuits, a judge could order an election official be jailed for breaking the law, but Perry said he’s only seen that happen once.
Candidates have a difficult time prevailing in election challenges. They must show how irregularities could have made a difference in the outcome of the race. The courts are reluctant to order a new election without clear evidence that the will of the people could not be determined.
Take the challenge of Eugene Fouche, a Black candidate for supervisor in Yazoo County, in 1979. This is the election challenge and ballot review Walker referenced – she was actually 21 at the time.
Walker called it a precedent-setting case that resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Fouche’s favor, finding that he should have been declared the winner over the white incumbent. 
That never happened, according to the lawyer who brought the case in circuit court, Ed Blackmon. The local judge dismissed the case and Fouche lost on appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, records show. 
“I’ve never cited it,” said Blackmon, who has brought several election challenges since.
Still, anyone interested in politics in Yazoo County in the 1970s and 80s would have been enthralled by the case, which came as Black Mississippians were increasingly engaging in politics following historic enfranchisement progress made during the Civil Rights Movement.
“I could think of someone who was living in that community at that time, that would be a seminal moment in their lives,” Blackmon said.
Where Archie has had slim success in his political career — winning just one of at least nine campaigns for office and serving one term as supervisor — he’s excelled at recruiting a loyal audience.

On his podcast, a recording by an R&B singer introduces the host, “David Archie, yeah, he’s a man that will take a stand,” before shifting into an Alvin Garrett tune belting, “If you won’t fight with me, if you don’t believe in me, I’m going to walk on by myself.”
Archie has been stirring up news long before the blockbuster supervisor’s meeting: getting arrested at a protest against racial profiling, holding a demonstration against a civil rights figure or alleging excessive force against Jackson airport officials after a bloody altercation during his 20s, when he worked as a fraud prevention officer with the state’s welfare department, according to the Clarion Ledger. 
“I know some of y’all are afraid to shake the system, to challenge government, to challenge status quo,” Archie told listeners on one of his most recent broadcasts. “And then you get mad at me because I’m fighting to make it better for you.”
Earlier this year, Archie ran for mayor of Jackson, then took a job in constituent services at City Hall at the tail end of then-Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s term before getting canned by incoming Mayor John Horhn.
He’s nothing if not persistent — a quality Hetrick and Walker say they can get behind.
Walker said in the majority of her election reviews, when she has recommended candidates challenge their election, they say they don’t have the money or energy. “No one thought David would go this distance,” Walker said.
Hetrick, who left her job under former Mayor Harvey Johnson in 2001 after a local newspaper printed her address, rattling the mother of a then-middle schooler, feels similarly ready to fight now.
Smith’s attorney in the election challenge, Warren Martin, offered another perspective: “He’s convinced people to follow him no matter what, follow him through the desert to water. But it’s a mirage. They’re drinking sand.”
Hetrick said the detractors are missing the point: The case isn’t just about Archie’s supervisor’s seat. It’s about shining a light on the brazen mishandling of elections at large. She doesn’t wish for the spectacle to discourage voters from participating in elections, but to ignite them to demand better.
“Even if we lose the trial, we’re not through,” Hetrick said.
By now, Smith has served nearly half of his four-year term. Judge Ford asked lawyers in the case to agree on a hearing date in the coming days, but it’s possible another appeal could delay it further. By the time Archie’s team exposes the evidence it says it has, the next election could be underway.
So will Archie run again? 
“I hope to be in the position before then,” he said. “And I absolutely, 100%, unless I’m sick or fall off the face of the earth, will run in 2027.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27161202/Archie-hearing-1.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

Charles Jackson French, a 22-year-old mess attendant aboard the USS Gregory, rescued 15 sailors during the Battle of Guadalcanal.
Four years before the U.S. entered World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as an attendant — one of the only positions open to Black Americans. And when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, he reenlisted.
Nine months later, three Japanese destroyers opened fire on the USS Gregory, killing 24 and injuring many others. When French saw injured shipmates drifting toward enemy fire, he tied a rope around his waist and dove into the dark water. He swam through the night, dragging the raft of injured shipmates through shark-infested waters. More than six hours later, a plane spotted them, and they were rescued.
French received a letter of commendation for his heroic act, but no medals.
Now his heroism is being recognized. The Naval Base in San Diego has renamed its rescue swimmer training pool after him. He has been posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and now the Navy plans to name a destroyer after him.
French’s nephew, Roscoe Harris, called the story of his uncle “an American story. … He cared about his fellow sailors. He cared about them when the Navy was segregated. He saved those white sailors because they needed saving.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/03125730/Sept5-charles-jackson-french-navy-73022-768x432-1.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) An Iowa nursing home inadvertently locked a resident out of the facility, leaving her outside the building overnight in the rain.
According to state inspection records, a female resident of the Harmony Marshalltown nursing home exited the facility at 8 p.m. on July 7, to sit in the home’s courtyard. The resident couldn’t get back into the facility until 6 a.m. the following day.
Inspectors allege the staff failed to do visual bed checks on the woman for 10 hours, leaving her pounding on the door of the building amid rain, thunder and lightning.

The woman “began to panic, became fearful, scared and crying,” inspectors allege. Eventually, a kitchen worker heard her pounding on the door and let her inside. The woman later told inspectors she would no longer go outside alone to smoke for fear of it happening again.
The woman “experienced serious actual psychosocial harm due to being left outside overnight,” the inspectors reported.
Inspectors concluded that while the courtyard door’s locking mechanism wasn’t engaged, the latch and the weight of the door effectively locked out anyone not strong enough to open it. The door “failed to open without excess force,” the inspectors concluded, which resulted in “in a serious likelihood of serious injury, impairment or death.”
The woman later told inspectors she had been had been scared and cold. She reported that she kept pushing on a doorbell to summon the staff but later learned the device was broken and didn’t work. She reported that she sat by the gas grill in the courtyard but didn’t want to touch it due to the lightning.
“She just tried to huddle against the door to keep warm,” the inspectors reported.
The kitchen employee who let the woman inside later told inspectors the woman was crying and shaking from being wet, scared and cold. A colleague described the woman as hysterical. A licensed practical nurse told inspectors the woman was “emotionally and psychosocially devastated” about being left outside all night.
Man was left with ‘nowhere to go’ 
Harmony Marshalltown was also cited for an incident involving a male resident of the home who left the facility on July 3 at 6 p.m. to visit his dog at a friend’s home. The man didn’t inform the staff he was leaving, according to inspectors.
At around 8:50 p.m., the administrator of the home became aware the staff couldn’t find the resident, so she and the director of nursing left the building to go look for the man.
At around 10 p.m., the administrator notified the police the man was missing. She and the director of nursing then continued their search until 1:30 a.m.
At about 2 a.m., the resident called Harmony Marshalltown to request a ride back to the facility from his brother’s house — although state records also refer to the house as belonging to a friend.
After no one from the facility showed up, the resident left his brother’s house and, at 5:30 a.m., was found at a gas station where the police provided assistance and summoned the administrator of the home.
At the convenience store, the administrator allegedly attempted to have the resident sign a form indicating he was discharging himself from the facility against the staff’s medical advice. The resident later told inspectors that because he was so angry about the situation, he signed the paperwork, after which the administrator left the store.
The inspectors allege the resident then drove his motorized wheelchair around town for a few hours, “scared, fearful and upset that he had nowhere to go.” At about 9:30 a.m. he returned to the home and was readmitted at his request.
According to the report of the state inspectors, they asked the administrator of Harmony Marshalltown about the staff’s failure to respond to the resident’s request for a ride. The inspectors allege the administrator responded that “she and the director of nursing were exhausted.” The administrator allegedly told the inspectors something to the effect of, “Excuse me if I went to bed (and) let the police handle the situation.”
The administrator reportedly added that she didn’t hear her phone when a worker called later to report the resident was at his brother’s house in need of a ride.
During her interview with inspectors, the administrator reportedly became “very upset” and, according to the inspectors, said, “Well, the facility didn’t have transportation to bring him back at that time of the morning and what were we supposed to do?”
According to the inspectors’ report, someone with the home’s corporate staff agreed the facility could have handled the incident better and had someone bring the man back to the home when he sought assistance.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing proposed three fines against Harmony Marshalltown totaling $19,000. The fines have been held in suspension while the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal fine is warranted.
The administrator of the home, Grace Maitland, was not at Harmony Marshalltown on Friday and could not be reached for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 11:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Over 100K CT residents could lose Medicaid coverage. What towns may be hit hardest?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/ct-medicaid-loss-town-data/,The One Big Beautiful Bill Act could cause 100K-170K people in CT to lose Medicaid coverage and would hit low-income areas the hardest.,"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act could cause millions of people to lose Medicaid coverage over the coming years — with estimates of between 100,000 and 170,000 people potentially impacted in Connecticut.
The law, passed on July 4, makes several changes to Medicaid and imposes limits on the amount of funding states can collect from the federal government for the program. However, this change would hit low-income areas the hardest.
Hartford is projected to undergo the biggest loss according to data from the Connecticut Data Haven, with 10.6% of the town’s total population projected to lose Medicaid coverage. That means that of the nearly 120,000 Hartford residents, nearly 13,000 stand to lose their coverage in the next decade. More than 90,000 people in Hartford receive health care under Medicaid. 
Waterbury and New Britain residents are also projected to have high levels of health care coverage loss. CT Data Haven found that 102,000 Connecticut residents who live below 200% of the federal poverty line are projected to lose Medicaid coverage. 
While the majority of those that may be impacted are white, a disproportionate percentage of minority communities — 9% of the Latino population and 8% of the Black population — are projected to lose coverage, according to CT Data Haven.
However, Medicaid isn’t the only health care coverage affected. Residents insured under Access Health CT, Connecticut’s official health insurance exchange, may also be impacted. A July press release from the organization stated that between 30% and 35% of its over 150,000 customers could lose coverage in the next decade.
“These changes can be expected to increase costs for customers here in Connecticut, and nationwide, and create barriers to financial help,” James Michel, the chief executive officer of Access Health CT, said in the press release regarding federal policy changes.
Nationwide, Medicaid enrollment is projected to drop according to analysis done by the KFF Health News, a nonprofit U.S. health policy organization.
It’s projected that, in Washington state, over a quarter of the population formerly eligible for Medicaid by 2034 would not receive coverage, while southeastern states would see more limited effects from the big beautiful bill. While Connecticut won’t see the biggest drops out of the entire nation, these changes could still leave thousands of people without insurance.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-111325.png,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514

Sept. 4, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThree groups of activists fighting extremism and local policies that reduce free speech in libraries, schools and other public spaces are looking to grow and organize against future attempts by the far-right to curtail critical thought.
On Thursday evening, a small but mighty cross-section of those groups gathered in Hartland, Michigan to discuss strategy, and to hopefully recruit like-minded people as conservative activists have made strides in their communities to take over local, county, school and library boards — many with the aim of undoing those institutions and suppressing access to information.
The three groups that gathered for the forum, to discuss those advances and how to fight them, included members of Stand Against Extremism of Livingston County, or SAGE, the Lapeer County chapter of Fight 4 the First and Friends of Patmos Library. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Together, the groups recently found themselves in a struggle to protect their local libraries from new efforts to defund the institution and upend staff to change the culture of the libraries In several instances, those libraries and schools have attempted to sequester books some board members have deemed sexually explicit or inappropriate for children. 
Many of the books in the latter instance have faced challenges from conservative groups and were targeted exclusively because they contain LGBTQ+ themes, or deal with other sensitive subjects, like racism or historical injustices.
While their work as individual units have helped prevent those efforts from taking root, or at the very least watered down new policies by bringing awareness to them, Julie Ohashi, cofounder of SAGE LivCo, said Thursday that those efforts have taken a great deal of time and energy to combat.
Simply put, Ohashi told the crowd that the forum was a call to action to bring new members into the fold and to help form a group similar to Fight 4 the First in Livingston County.
Local Michigan library board backs away from policy to sequester LGBTQ+ themed books

“This is how this starts,” Ohashi said. “This is a great start, because you can go home and have conversations with four or five more people, and then the next group comes in, and we’re three-times bigger.”
The panel also talked shop on ways average people could fight against hostile takeovers of small community boards by Christian and far-right activists.
Kate DeRosier, a former member of the Cromaine District Library Board of Trustees, which was at the center of a sequestration and labeling effort earlier this year, said it was important for new activists to understand that what is occurring is not a normal function of a library or school board.
She said that before the board came under the leadership of Bill Bollin, pastor of the FloodGate Church in Brighton, Cromaine officials were never involved with book challenges.
“The board is there for big picture [issues], fiduciary, advocacy, community outreach, planning and long-term views,” DeRosier said. “Its is not to operate on a daily basis. This is a new problem … since the 2022 election. It’s been painful to watch as a former board member but also a library lover. It’s not normal. This is not the correct conduct of a board anywhere.”
One of the first strategy steps discussed at the forum Thursday was to know your rights and never back down to bullies, even if those bullies hold high positions of power.
In that vein, several people who attended the forum, held at the Hartland Music Hall, said they were concerned about eroding free speech rights across the nation. Ohashi said that the first simple act of showing up to public meetings and not backing down has been a measure for some of their success.
It was also suggested that power in numbers was always effective.
One community member from Livingston County noted that the Cromaine District Library Board of Trustees has created a suppressive environment at public meetings.
In June, when the board was deliberating on its new policy to label books as explicit — again, those with LGBTQ+ content and themes — called the sheriff’s office and had activists thrown out for speaking out. One board member and her husband, who is a member of the local school board, physically removed some of them. 
One advantage of joining an established activist group, like SAGE, Ohashi said, was that they were well versed in their rights.
Some panelists suggested making recordings of each meeting or event where activists might find themselves at odds with those they are trying to shine a light on.
Lapeer library board mulls age restrictions on materials despite shaky legal ground 

Building bridges, not walls
Rhonda Laur with Fight 4 the First, said the group led an effort to have Lapeer District Library board member John DeAngelis resign from his position due to his affiliation with the AxMiTax anti-property tax ballot initiative. The initiative, if it makes the ballot and is approved by voters, would eliminate property tax in Michigan — which is a source of funding for some tax-dependent libraries. 
In the case of the Lapeer District Library, property tax is a primary funding source.
While the cascading efforts to remove him or have him resign were ultimately unsuccessful, Laur said the group was able to gather nearly 300 signatures calling for his resignation. They did that by being relentless in their organizing efforts, which included pickets, writing letters to the editors of local newspapers and speaking up at every meeting.
Gigi Griffith, also with Fight 4 the First, added that it was OK to be annoying to those who might not uphold a community’s First Amendment and free speech rights.
Tricia Kryda, with Friends of Patmos Library, said it was important to be hyperaware of the opposition’s talking points and highlight them when they suddenly back away from them once they are elected. She noted that the Patmos Library Board flipped to a conservative majority that primarily ran on the wave issue of parental rights over what their children were reading, learning about or consuming in other media.
Kryda said once they were elected, the ethos changed to a belief that the board had been given a mandate by voters to take care of the issue of those materials themselves, disavowing their initial zeal in letting parents decide what is right for their children.
“You have to kind of hold those people back and say, ‘they did say this,’” Kryda said. “Well look at what they did. Don’t look at what they said, look at what they do. That’s really important, because it’s been a fight to get people to listen to someone [who might be considered more liberal on the issues facing schools and libraries].”
Kryda said you have to slowly peel the situation back to expose hypocrisies in some instances, and that includes slowly bringing your conservative friends back into the fold to help fight against censorship.
Ohashi said that was true in Livingston County, saying there were many anti-censorship conservatives who might be willing to join in the fight.
Griffith noted that it was a matter of letting them in and not alienating them.
“You’ve got to get them in by getting on their level and parents’ rights is a great way to do that,” Griffith said. “This shouldn’t be political.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250904_181721-scaled-e1757069378767-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

While dispensaries in other states are offering steep discounts to try and attract customers, Missouri’s prices have remained steady. 
“Missouri is viewed as a stronger market than others,” said Kris Walker, president and chief commercial officer at Hoodie Analytics, during a panel discussion on retail data analysis. “There are things happening in Missouri that are causing consumers to not just be shopping on price. When you’re only shopping on price, it becomes a race to the bottom.”
Samuel Soong, chief revenue officer at Grön cannabis edible brand, called Missouri customers “very savvy.” 
“They know what they want,” he said. “They’re expecting a lot of value in their purchasing.”
The numbers agree. When the average shopper goes to a Missouri dispensary, they end up spending about $65, with the average price per item being $24.60, according to data compiled by Hoodie. That’s above the national average of $61 and $18.41. 
In Colorado and New Mexico, the average item price is about $11. 
The most popular item in Missouri is still traditional marijuana buds, or what the industry simply calls “flower.” However, the item that’s seen the most growth in the last year — both in Missouri and nationwide — is pre-rolled joints. 
A year ago, 48% of every transaction included flower, and today it’s 43%. Walker said that’s largely due to customers buying more pre-rolled joints, which are often infused with concentrated cannabis oil. They’re designed for people who want a more potent and longer-lasting high than what traditional flower offers. 
“It’s a convenient form factor,” said Krista Raymer, chief strategy officer at C3 Industries that operates High Profile cannabis dispensaries. “It’s great for the customer.”
Raymer said in some other states, the growth of pre-rolled joints has brought challenges because it meant that customers are spending less.
“Fundamentally, they are purchasing less brands per transaction,” she said. “Missouri pre-roll prices are holding a little bit differently than maybe what we’ve seen in other markets, but it is something that we pay attention to, a lot.”
Throughout the country, Missouri is still considered a “shining star,” Walker said. 
John Mueller, co-founder and CEO at Greenlight, believes the regulatory environment is a big part of the state’s success, particularly because the industry was able to write its own laws.
“If you can write your own rules and ballot initiative and it’s in the constitution, that’s like your best line of defense,” Mueller said. 
Every year, industry lobbyists work to kill any legislation that attempts to “control our business,” he said. 
“Just let us do business, stay out of our way, we keep paying the veterans, everything’s good here,” Mueller said. “I go around talking in the other states we operate, I think we’ve set a gold standard here.”
He also points to the limited number of licenses. 
“Limited licenses is the whole key to any market,” he said. “We won’t go into a market unless there’s a set number.” 
Walker said that Missouri also has “disciplined operators.” 
“If you’ve got a discipline operator who knows they’re running a business for profit and growth and long-term brand building, you make different decisions than, ‘Oh my God, the guy across the street just dropped his price by 30%. I should do it too,’” he said. “That is an undisciplined choice that unfortunately has very significant consequences.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MJ-Unpacked-sales-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

(Map from READI website)A state-commissioned report endorses the state’s regional economic development approach, aligning with districts established under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. 
The Regional Economic and Acceleration and Development Initiative, or READI, allocates federal and state dollars to boost public-private projects seeking to improve Hoosiers’ quality of life. Some projects focused on housing or transportation while others funded parks or community centers.
Earlier this year, Gov. Mike Braun issued an executive order ordering an assessment of economic development regions in the state by the year’s end — and researchers with the Indiana University Kelley School of Business submitted their report on Aug. 15. Braun publicized the 12-page document on Thursday.

“This report proves what we’ve seen on the ground: Indiana’s regions are strong, well-defined, and ready to lead. The 15 READI regions were built by local leaders, tested through real collaboration, and now validated by independent research. By aligning the state around this framework, we remove confusion, cut costs, and give Hoosiers one clear plan forward,” Braun said in a release.
Though not the state’s first stab at a regional economic development approach, READI first launched in 2021 with $500 million. That round was so popular — the overseeing Indiana Economic Development Corporations had to process $1.5 billion in requests across 800 projects — that lawmakers approved another $500 million in 2023. 
The first-round awards were dispersed slowly, mostly due to requirements tied to the federal dollars. But the second round of state dollars moved more quickly. During a tight budget session, legislators declined to include a third round of funding in the 2025 budget. 
The first round involved 17 districts. For the second READI round, local units of government organized into 15 regions, the base of the IU analysis. Researchers Phil Powell and Tim Slaper, with the Indiana Business Research Center found that, “READI regions provide a socially efficient and empirically sound foundation for regional policy, satisfying the goals of (Braun’s) executive order.” 
“They capture economic activity nearly as effectively as state-drawn regions, but with the added advantage of trust and collaboration already built among local leaders. That gives Indiana a durable framework to deliver economic and workforce development,” said Powell, the executive director of the Indiana Business Research Center, in the release.
Indiana Secretary of Commerce David Adams likewise praised the paper and its conclusion.
“This report confirms that Indiana’s regional approach is working. With READI regions now validated as the economic planning framework, we can focus on strategy — empowering regions to grow population, wages, and opportunity with one clear map,” he said.
Different types of county groupings considered by IU researchers include READI regions, Economic Growth Regions and Metropolitan Statistical Areas. (Maps from READI, the Indiana Department of Workforce Development and the Census Bureau)

Other agencies use different boundaries for their various missions, including within the IEDC. As such, the study explored whether the regional economic development approach under READI could be translated into other workforce and economic development activities.

The current 12 Economic Growth Regions used by some agencies were organized under former Gov. Mitch Daniels without the same input from local governments. Powell and Slaper compared the READI districts with those regions as well as Metropolitan Statistical Areas used by the federal government. 
Notably the Metropolitan Statistical Areas are grouped across state boundaries, meaning that portions of Indiana belong to regions centered around Chicago, Louisville and Cincinnati.
Intergovernmental cooperation makes READI regions “a socially efficient choice,” research concluded, though that is weakest in southern Indiana. The nine-county Economic Growth Region containing Evansville, for example, is split between three different READI regions with roughly five noncontiguous counties lumped into one region. The paper cautions that special consideration should be given to this southwestern corner of the state when granting project dollars to ensure cohesiveness. 
However, the three different groupings of counties are relatively comparable, with all having overall tightness scores between 0.868 and 0.891 on a 0-1 scale.

One Illinois man’s decadeslong fight to convert his fields into rice paddies demonstrates how it’s possible to bring diversity to the Corn Belt, but improbable so long as federal farm policy remains focused on soybeans and corn.

On a late July morning, Blake Gerard zips across his Southern Illinois rice farm on a four-wheeler, wearing his usual USA Rice shirt and shorts that hit above the knee. It’s the only rice farm in Illinois, a place where rice never grew before.
He carries rubber hip boots in his truck for when he needs to wade into the water to check or change its depth. The young rice has entered a crucial stage; it has taken root but is still tender and needs a shallow, steady blanket of water, which Gerard maintains with a system of cascading fields surrounded by levees and pumps. Two to 4 inches of water is ideal.

Second image: Young rice requires between 2 and 4 inches of water to grow. Third image: Gerard holds soil from the thick, muddy ground that he calls “gumbo.” (First and second images: Julia Rendleman for ProPublica.

For the parts of the fields he can’t reach in his truck, a drone does the seeing. This morning, it catches a patch where the water pools too deep, and he turns on a pump, moving water into a drainage ditch that flows into the nearby Mississippi River. “That whole corner would’ve gone under if I hadn’t seen it,” Gerard says.
This daily scramble across 2,500 acres of flat, muddy bottomlands is now routine for one of America’s northernmost commercial rice farmers. But it wasn’t always. Gerard’s story is both proof that change and innovation in farming are possible and evidence of how hard they are — and why so few have tried. The transition took decades. It was also expensive and largely unsupported by federal farm policy, which is heavily focused on corn and soybeans.
Corn, soy and wheat were the crops Gerard, now 55, was growing in the early 1990s when he took over his family farm near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. By then, the floods were already coming more often. Gerard’s grandfather remembered them in 1943 and 1973, but as Gerard began farming, they came every two years — in ’93, ’95 and ’97.


Gerard plants rice near the Mississippi River in spring 2024. The land is prone to flooding, which Gerard uses to his advantage to grow rice. He refers to rain as “free water.” (Julia Rendleman for ProPublica)

According to the latest National Climate Assessment, annual precipitation in the Midwest increased in some places by as much as 15% between 1992 and 2001. Importantly for farmers, the amount of precipitation on the days with the most rain has increased by 45% over the past 50 years.
“The most extreme heavy precipitation is increasing at a far faster rate than overall total seasonal or annual precipitation,” explained Trent Ford, the Illinois state climatologist. That increased intensity “has been a faster and larger change, and that has caused more impacts due to flooding and erosion.”
For Gerard, a fourth-generation crop farmer, only in his 20s, working the fields of the Mississippi River bottomlands in Alexander County, Illinois, there was no sense in fighting the water anymore.
“I could grow something that would grow in water,” he said. Or quit.
Climate change is shifting where rice can grow. Long considered a southern crop, it has crept north through the Missouri Bootheel, and with Gerard’s expanded operation, now has a foothold in Southern Illinois. It’s a crop that can thrive where others can’t, like along the riverbanks of flood-prone Alexander County.
But for many farmers, making the transition to a new crop is nearly impossible, as ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois reported this week. Although rice is a commodity crop and Gerard receives insurance subsidies and commodity supports, corn and soybeans dominate U.S. agriculture, especially in the Midwest, and that’s what federal subsidies are set up to support.
Federally backed insurance for those crops cushions the risk of climate change for growers, even in floodplains; ethanol policy props up demand; and the entire infrastructure — from grain bins to rail lines to river barges — helps move corn and soy from fields to market to overseas. Illinois is the second-largest corn exporter in the nation.
There’s also culture: Farmers tend to grow what their parents and grandparents did. Even the local experts — the folks at the nearby Farm Bureau offices and university extension programs — are largely trained in what’s always been done.
“Everything’s stacked against it,” said Jonathan Coppess, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture official and current farm policy expert at the University of Illinois. “Nobody says no, but the system doesn’t know how to say yes.”
And federal policy is moving deeper in that direction. President Donald Trump has scrubbed climate language from farm programs. Although the “Big, Beautiful Bill” signed in July provides additional funding for programs that could help with crop diversification, it largely reinforces the idea that crops should stay where they’ve always been.
ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois sought comment from the USDA on Aug. 20 about how it is responding to climate change and crop diversification. An agency spokesperson said the USDA was working on a response but did not provide it in time for publication or specify a day when it would respond.
This stretch of the country where Gerard did the seemingly impossible is an important testing ground. But it wasn’t easy. There were no mills to process what he grew, no market to sell it into, no roadmap to follow. Ultimately, it took 25 years and millions of dollars to make it work. Gerard shows what is possible, but also how improbable it is for the Corn Belt to diversify without the sustained effort of federal policy.

In 1943, when the Mississippi tore away from its banks and charted a fierce and muddy course across America’s central farmlands, Gerard’s grandfather, Harold Gerard, had already fled the waters once.
He had been living on a tiny island in the middle of the river just north of Cairo, Illinois. Seeking dry land that would be amenable to the wheat, alfalfa, corn and cotton he was accustomed to growing, he moved his family about 30 miles north.
But even there, the water kept rising. Blake’s father took over the farm and put in a pump on his lowest field to take water away from the corn, but the water kept coming up.
“The water comes from under the ground here,” Blake Gerard said.
He was studying at Mississippi State when his father died in August 1990. Overwhelmed, he left school, came home and harvested the final crop his father had planted. But with floods coming more frequently, he worried that the government would get out of the crop insurance business, which helped keep him afloat. He briefly considered fish farming but worried about floods there too. Ultimately, Gerard realized he needed a crop that loved the thick, muddy ground he calls “gumbo.”

Around that time, farm policy was changing: In 1996, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act — known as the “Freedom to Farm Act” — gave farmers flexibility in crop choice.
He looked south, to Arkansas and Missouri, for guidance, driving around, knocking on doors and asking farmers about a crop that wasn’t afraid of the water.
At one farm in the Missouri Bootheel, an older man listened to Gerard’s questions for an hour, then said, “You know what? I met your dad. You’re a lot like your dad. He came down here in the ’70s asking me the same questions.”
Gerard hadn’t known about his father’s early interest. But it led them both to the same place, where he found his answer: “I’ve got rice ground.”
In 1999, Gerard planted his first 40 acres of rice. The next season, he tripled his acreage. After that, Gerard started converting his fields “like crazy.” There were no government programs to help pay for the transition, and it was expensive.
The big effort was grading the land: flattening it and building embankments so water would cascade from one field into the next. At $1,000 per acre, Gerard would invest millions into turning his ground from soy to rice.
Gerard realizes the investment was one he could only have made when he was still young and unafraid of debt. “I had time to get it all paid for, but if you’re my age now, mid-50s, why do I want to borrow a quarter of a million dollars to do this and make all these changes and create more work for myself? It’s more work. Rice farming is way more work. Double, triple the work that corn and beans are.”
Gerard also had to invest heavily in farm equipment. He rattles off a list: power units, fuel tanks, turbines, pipes, the water control structures, and on and on. Gerard scratches his head when asked about his total investment — it’s too much to remember and too hard to keep track of, he said. What he knew for certain was that he was going to commit to rice.

This year, Gerard’s farm finally got some help: a Climate-Smart Commodities grant that would allow him to invest in things like soil moisture meters, pump automation and water monitors. Then in April, he received more news: The funding, considered a “climate” program, had been canceled by the Trump administration. Then in May, he was told the funding was back — under a different name.
But around the state, conditions for farming this year have continued to deteriorate. In May, the National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning for the first time ever for the city of Chicago. High winds brought loose topsoil across the state and into the city, limiting visibility and shocking meteorologists who had not documented a weather event of this kind in the city since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.
Researchers believe that the corn and soybean rotation that dominates Midwestern farming is at least partially to blame — replacing the grasses that gave the Prairie State its nickname with crop rotations that don’t hold the soil in place, and a steady stream of fertilizers and pesticides doesn’t help.
The dominance of soy and corn, with little variation, could have “possible long-term impacts” on “economic returns, communities, and the environment,” according to the website for Diverse Corn Belt, a USDA-funded project of researchers and scientists who collaborate with government agencies, farmers and conservation groups. They want to find ways to give farmers more crop options.
That’s especially pressing in places like Alexander County, a corner of the country that bridges different farming regions. “It’s one of the most difficult places to understand in U.S. agriculture,” said Silvia Secchi, a professor at the University of Iowa, who studies farm policy and is an investigator with Diverse Corn Belt. “But the system isn’t built for a place like this. The system is built for: you’re in Nebraska, you raise cattle; you’re in Iowa, you grow corn. All these places that are kind of funky at the margin — we don’t make policy for them.”
Diversifying crop rotations would help in the Midwest, but also in places with other climate-related woes, like increasingly dry Texas and storm-wracked Louisiana. Making such changes is not impossible, said Louisiana State University researcher Herry Utomo, who developed the rice strain grown by Gerard. Climate change is “coming anyway, so we have to be positive and respond to it appropriately,” he said. “With good planning, anticipation and understanding of the rate of change, we can respond.”

But Coppess, a former USDA official, said farm policy has never been great at planning for climate change.
“There’s nothing in farm policy that takes into account climate change. In fact, most arguments would be that it’s at best neutral and at worst counterproductive for climate change,” Coppess said.
And under Trump, research universities are losing funding and climate initiatives are being decimated.
For Gerard, his willingness to risk everything paid off. He had a banner year in 2024 — his most successful rice-farming year to date. He no longer wonders whether the “big river” or a deluge will take out his crop. While a range of factors — from weather to international markets — affect whether he makes money, his shift to rice has taken production volatility out of the equation and he rests easier.

He remembers one of his first harvests, late in the growing season, when the mature stalks of rice had begun to bend toward the ground under the weight of their own grain.
One farmer, he recalled, pulled over and laughed at the drooping stalks. To him, the field looked ruined — nothing like the stiff, proud stalks of wheat growing nearby.
“People said you can’t grow rice here,” Gerard said. “I had the crop growing in the field and they’re like, ‘You can’t grow rice, we’re in Illinois, they grow rice in Louisiana.’”
That was a quarter-century ago.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers entered the 2023 legislative session with a majority in both chambers and a pair of gun control bills high on their list of priorities: universal background checks for firearm purchases and a “red flag” law, which allows judges to confiscate guns from people who are a danger to themselves or others.
They succeeded in passing both priorities, plus a few other gun control policies, all without Republican support.
Democrats stopped short of banning semiautomatic military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, like those used by the shooter who fired more than 100 rounds into Annunciation Church in Minneapolis last week, killing two students and injuring 21 others. 
Following that shooting, Gov. Tim Walz said he will call lawmakers back to the Capitol early to consider those bans and potentially other gun control legislation. 
These firearms were banned federally from 1994 to 2004, but states have since been left to their own devices to figure out their own legislation on assault weapons and 10 have done so. There is some evidence that banning high-capacity magazines and assault weapons reduces deaths in mass shootings.
(Gun rights advocates criticize the term “assault weapons,” arguing that the definition is largely based on aesthetics rather than function; Minnesota law defines 17 firearm models and their offshoots as “semiautomatic military-style assault weapons,” including AK-47s and AR-15s.)
But the odds of gun control legislation passing are worse now that Democrats have lost control of the House and Senate, pending special elections. Republicans have 67 members in the House, while Democrats have 66 following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. Any gun control legislation would need bipartisan support in a special session to pass.
“I’m going to need some Republicans to break with the orthodoxy and say that we need to do something on guns,” Walz said at a news conference this week. 
Gov. Tim Walz, on Sept. 2, 2025, said he will call a special session for lawmakers to vote on gun control measures after two children were killed and another 21 wounded at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis last week. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)
So why didn’t Democrats ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines when they controlled the Legislature? 
In 2023, Democratic lawmakers had bills to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines as well as new requirements that guns be stored safely and reported lost or stolen in a timely manner. 
Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, introduced an assault weapons ban in 2023 but DFL leaders didn’t forward the legislation for a hearing. He said Democrats for a long time have been scared to talk about gun control and are worried about their reelection prospects if they take a stand on stricter gun measures.
“Democratic politicians are still in the old mindset that it could hurt them to talk about gun violence. I happen to believe that regardless of public opinion, the public respects people who are willing to talk about the tough issues,” Marty said.
Similarly, in the House, DFL Floor Leader Jamie Long of Minneapolis said in a press conference after the shooting that he had drafted a bill banning semiautomatic military-style assault weapons in 2023, but never introduced it.
“(It) felt like the right decision to try to focus on taking that really big, important first step on gun violence, and I think we’re ready to take even bigger steps now,” Long said.
Those bills were unlikely to pass, even had they received hearings.
At least three Democratic senators — Grant Hauschild of Hermantown, Rob Kupec of Moorhead and Judy Seeberger of Afton  — said they wouldn’t support any gun control measures other than the red flag law and universal background checks.

Last year, the House passed legislation requiring safe storage and the reporting of lost or stolen guns. The bills never came up for a vote in the Senate.
The three senators have remained quiet on the issue of gun control since the school shooting. 
Hauschild and Seeberger did not return the Reformer’s calls for this story. Kupec declined an interview. 
In an unrelated press conference Thursday, Seeberger was asked whether she would support an assault weapons ban, and she said she’s reviewing proposals.
“We need to get together and figure out what we can pass. We can’t do anything without each other, and so it’s going to be important for all of us to speak,” Seeberger said. 
The resistance from Hauschild and Kupec, among just a handful of Democrats representing greater Minnesota, reflects a rural-urban divide over guns. 
A 2022 MinnPost poll found that a slight majority of Minnesotans — 54% — supported banning “assault-style weapons.” The topline number belies an urban-rural divide; 51% of rural Minnesotans opposed an assault weapons ban, while 69% of urban residents supported a ban. The same poll found that a slight majority of rural Minnesotans also oppose bans on high-capacity magazines.
Walz has noted the public broadly supports assault weapons bans and suggested Republicans would risk public backlash by voting against the proposals in a special session. But a special session would force difficult votes for members of his own party, too.
“Some of these votes are not easy for members, and members can only make so many difficult votes at a time,” said Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, who chairs the public safety committee. “These are close bills. So we got done the two biggest, most far reaching and impactful ones that we thought we could accomplish, and let the other one sit for another day.”
Republicans remain uninterested in new gun laws with Senate Republican Leader Mark Johnson calling a potential special session a “partisan stunt.” 
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, was evasive when asked if her caucus would support an assault weapons ban or any other gun control proposal: “I can’t really say whether or not we would be for or against something without seeing what the proposal is.” 
Her caucus released a “school safety agenda” on Thursday in response to the Annunciation shooting that didn’t include any proposals on gun control. Instead, they called for increased funding for school safety at private schools, boosting funding for more mental health treatment beds and increasing penalties for repeat firearm offenders. Their agenda also includes reversing a conversion therapy ban for minors.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250903_0073-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

Somehow, the plan allegedly rooted in faith values to represent Christians means driving out of office one of only three ministers in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a Baptist minister in Missouri who would be thrown from the third district to the fifth district that is currently Cleaver’s seat, I reject efforts to bless this profane partisan power grab as based on Christian values.
During the redistricting process over three years ago — at the constitutionally prescribed time — some conservative politicians and activists unsuccessfully targeted Cleaver’s seat. Ultimately, state lawmakers approved a map keeping a 6-2 Republican advantage in Missouri’s congressional delegation instead of carving up Kansas City to try for a 7-1 map now under consideration.
Of course, a 5-3 split would more closely match statewide elections. That divide still gives Republicans a bit more than the 2024 results when Trump defeated Kamala Harris 58%-40% and Kehoe beat Crystal Quade 59%-39%. So the current map is gerrymandered, just not as badly as Trump wants.
Even if we accept O’Laughlin’s claim of needing a map to represent “Missouri’s Christian conservative majority,” that would not justify a 7-1 map. Only 62% of Missourians identify as Christian — the same percentage as five seats out of eight. Even that gives her argument too much credit since not all of Missouri’s Christians are conservatives, as Cleaver proves.
For those who desired a 7-1 split three years ago, the partisan goal of rigging the maps was often cast as a Christian mission. As I documented in my new book, The Bible According to Christian Nationalists, proponents of a 7-1 map in 2022 misused Scripture to justify trying to oust a Methodist politician. They twisted Bible verses out of context to depict themselves as divinely chosen heroes on a righteous crusade to save the nation.
Yet, as they gerrymandered the Bible to defend their partisanship, they overlooked basic moral teachings like treat others how you want them to treat you, do not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. Kehoe and O’Laughlin make the same mistake now. They wish to claim the mantle of upholding Christian values all while violating how Jesus clearly taught his followers to behave.
Although Kehoe and O’Laughlin spin their motives, Cleaver noted more honestly what this “unprecedented” attempt will do. Calling it a move to “silence voices,” Cleaver insisted voters should pick their representatives, not the other way around. He added: “Our nation has endured wars, depressions, and great struggles for civil rights. And through it all, the principle that every vote counts has carried us forward. That principle is bigger than me, this seat, or any president looking to rig the rules for personal gain.”
If Kehoe and O’Laughlin were honest, they would admit the inspiration for this partisan gerrymandering came not from Christian values but Trump. While they appear to hold enough political power to ram the new map through, they do not own the terms “faith” and “Christian.” I will not sit by quietly as they seek to rig morality.
As the biblical prophet Isaiah insisted, we must not call bitter “sweet” or call evil “good.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022724_cleaverfiling1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

(Photo by Tom Banse)A billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded enterprise to kickstart a clean hydrogen industry in the Pacific Northwest took another hit due to energy companies getting cold feet. 
Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon. 
“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email. 
The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”
Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. 
“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppherd said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”
The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.
PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.
Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere. 
Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.
The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.
Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.
AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.
“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement. 
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Hydrogen sector dependent on uncertain government support
A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach. 
Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years. 
But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen. 
“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.
“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.
Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.
A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.
Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.
“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”
If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.
Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.
“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.

In her new role, Jenner will continue to lead the state's K-12 education department, as well. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)If there is anyone who deserves a raise in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration, it’s Secretary of Education Katie Jenner. Especially now that she will essentially be doing two full-time jobs.
Jenner recently was named the new commissioner for higher education on top of the state’s highest K-12 official.
She replaces Chris Lowery, whose resignation takes effect next month. His salary was $237,000, and Jenner’s is $275,000. And she isn’t getting any more to double her workload.
Of course, there is more to this move than just dollars.
Chairman of the higher ed board, Dan Peterson, praised the move — saying it “helps bring the education vertical as close together as possible, makes a ton of sense. He also added that “when you’re a great leader, you get more and more responsibility.”
On one hand, I understand that K-12 and higher education are related and should have seamless coordination. But how much can one person handle without a change in performance?
And I would argue that both the higher education and K-12 systems need someone fully watching their back. They are related but have distinct charges and goals.
K-12 certainly has a role to play in ensuring Indiana’s future workforce is prepared to fill open jobs. But it shouldn’t eclipse the more important foundation of reading and math skills, as well as offering well-rounded opportunities for all students.
Indiana’s college-going rate drops again, dipping to 51.7%

Accountability, absenteeism and graduation rates are among the most important items handled by the Indiana Department of Education. We have finally started to see metrics moving in the right direction for Indiana’s students, and part of that is due to Jenner’s focus on those items. She is also a master at staying out of the political fights and keeping her eyes on students.
Meanwhile, the Commission for Higher Education has seen its plate of duties grow in recent years as legislators have added more authority and tasks. For instance, they now handle intellectual diversity complaints; they spearheaded a recent reduction in degree offerings; and now have to annually prepare and submit reports that examine the utilization of physical facilities for instruction at each state educational institution.
On top of that, the agency reviews operating and capital budget requests of the state’s universities and colleges; administers $400 million annually in student financial aid; monitors tuition; and advances career and technical education.
The most significant goal of the agency is improving Indiana’s college-going rate as more jobs require some sort of postsecondary training or education. But that statistic has been hard to move.
What’s next for CHE and DOE? They both have separate boards, unless the next step is to combine them.
The Braun administration already eliminated the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet. It was established in 2005 to “ensure a talent-driven education and workforce system by addressing current and future needs for Indiana employers and individuals, strengthen Indiana’s economy by integrating state and federal resources, and provide strategic alignment for state agencies and organizations driving workforce, education and economic development.”
It was abolished as of July 1, and duties were transferred to the Department of Workforce Development — another agency seeing funding cuts and layoffs.
The state budget said responsibilities of the cabinet related to education were shifted to CHE.
Jenner’s new appointment might be a brilliant move. But in the short-term, it’s another example of the “do more with less” mantra that could have long-term costs.

The State Health Benefits Commission approved the increases on Sept. 14, 2022, despite the protest. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State and labor officials have reached an agreement to cut costs for New Jersey’s distressed state worker health plan after months of protests and negotiations, officials announced Thursday.
The deal would reverse a $100 million cut state lawmakers signed off on when they passed a new $58.8 billion state budget in June, which would have been borne by state employees covered by the State Health Benefits Program.
While workers still will see their out-of-pocket costs rise, those increases will be “modest,” and the agreement bars any increases in member contributions next year, according to Communications Workers of America District 1, which represents more than 140,000 state workers.
It also requires reforms intended to identify the root causes of runaway medical costs and contain costs going forward, and urges state legislators to ensure future budgets respect existing health care agreements, union officials said.
Gov. Phil Murphy in a statement characterized the deal as one that would implement one of the most significant updates to state health benefits plans in nearly 15 years. The changes must be approved by a state committee, which is expected to review the agreement later this month.
“I am committed to working with the unions until the end of my Administration to provide solid recommendations to future State leaders on how the State can adopt best practices and get the best deals in the health care market on medical care and drug pricing,” said Murphy, a Democrat whose two terms as governor are ending in January.
Billy Gallagher, the union’s assistant to the vice president, called the agreement “a hard-won victory for the 100,000 state workers and retirees who were facing catastrophic health care cost hikes.”
“It proves that when we sit down at the table through the proper channels, we can find solutions that protect working families and control costs for the state,” Gallagher said in a statement.
According to Murphy’s office, the agreement includes some of the following changes:

A $110 in-network deductible for individuals and $220 in-network deductible for families for all plans that currently have lower deductibles.
A $750 out-of-network deductible for individuals and $1,500 out-of-network deductible for families for all plans that currently have lower deductibles.
A $2,500 out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximum for individuals and $6,000 out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximum for families for all plans that currently have lower out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximums.
New co-pays on anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, plus generic, brand, nonpreferred brand, and specialty medications across all plans.
New co-pays on lab visits and imaging across all plans.
Limits on out-of-network physical therapy visits across all plans.

Under the deal, the state and union officials will create a working group to draft a roadmap for the next administration that will recommend ways to stem soaring health care costs, including by reducing provider prices. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill are vying in November to succeed Murphy.
Officials also will examine overpayments to providers and work to recoup those funds, promote in-network providers over costly out-of-network options, and steer employees to ambulatory surgery centers instead of hospitals for common procedures like colonoscopies and lumpectomies, the union said.
They’ll also implement a reverse auction, or online bidding process, to cut pharmaceutical costs and incentivize healthy lifestyles to manage costs associated with employees on pricy weight-loss medications, officials said.
“This deal not only rescinds a dangerous precedent of bypassing our contracts but also establishes a collaborative path forward to tackle the root causes of rising health care costs,” Gallagher said. “It is a powerful testament to what we can achieve through collective bargaining and good-faith dialogue, and it ensures our members’ voices are heard in shaping the future of their healthcare.”
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) in a statement said he is pleased by the agreement.
“We have always believed that the best way to make public health benefits affordable for taxpayers and public employees is by working collaboratively with workers and their unions,” he said. “We look forward to reviewing the agreement and continuing our efforts to protect taxpayers from rising costs while providing affordable health care options to public workers.”
While union leaders and Democrats celebrated, the New Jersey Legislature’s Republican leader and budget officer lamented the news, saying the deal just defers problems with the health benefits program to a later date.
“It’s clear the Democrats’ health insurance plan means increased property taxes and big premium increases for public employees,” Sens. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) and Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) said in a joint statement. “Meanwhile, the local benefits death spiral is being left to the next governor to fix.”
The Treasury said in a May report that the side of the State Health Benefits Program that covers local government workers has become “structurally unstable” and “financially unsustainable” after years of sharp premium increases and a dwindling subscriber pool.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-09-05 10:35:55+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,"State, school district defend NJ guidance on transgender students from court challenge",Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/05/state-school-district-defend-nj-guidance-on-transgender-students-from-court-challenge/,A Hunterdon County dad sued the state in an effort to overturn 2018 state guidance on transgender students.,"Attorneys for the state and a Hunterdon County school district are hitting back at a parent's lawsuit challenging statewide guidance on transgender students. (Photo by Alexander Castro)Parents’ constitutional right to raise their children how they want does not give them authority over school policy, attorneys for the state and a Hunterdon County school district argue in new court filings defending state guidance on transgender students.
The filings are the latest development in an escalating legal battle that started in January 2024 when Christin Heaps of Pittstown sued his daughter’s school, the Delaware Valley Regional High School in Frenchtown, after he learned school officials agreed to the child’s request to use a male name and pronouns without telling him.
Heaps wants a judge to strike down Policy 5756, the guidance state education officials issued in 2018 that advises districts they can accept a student’s change in gender identity without notifying parents. A federal judge has twice ruled against Heaps. He’s now appealing his case to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals with the help of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group.
Attorneys Roshan D. Shah and Ashu Verma represent the district and school board. In a Tuesday brief, they agree that the right of parents in the care and custody of their children is one of the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests encompassed by the Constitution’s due process clause.
“However, the historical analysis of how far this right extends does not support the broad power that Heaps believes he wields — i.e., the power to dictate the school environment and the policies governing it,” they added.
Neither the Constitution nor court precedents give parents the right to “notice and veto power over a high-school-aged student’s preferred pronouns or name,” they wrote. Heaps ignores that parental rights must be balanced with a child’s right to privacy, they added.
“Heaps’s position leaves no space for this balancing. He ignores that the desire to maintain confidentiality originated with Jane,” they wrote of Heaps’ daughter, who’s identified as Jane Doe in filings. “His argument effectively demands that school officials ignore the student’s request in all instances no matter the consequences. The Constitution doesn’t impose such a Hobson’s choice upon school officials.”
Attorneys for the state argued in a Tuesday brief that Heaps’ belief in the supremacy of parental rights, if applied to school policies universally, would wreak havoc in schools. They gave examples of students secretly eating school lunches of chicken nuggets when their parents are vegetarian, changing into skirts once they got to school when parents object to such clothing, or asking to go by their middle name in school.
“On Heaps’s expansive view of substantive due process, and without a limiting principle, a school would risk infringing the parent’s constitutional rights any time it honored these students’ requests over the parent’s objections,” attorneys from Attorney General Matt Platkin’s office wrote. “Educators would be subject to disruptive and inconsistent demands, undermining uniformity and predictability at school.”
They pointed to a 1948 landmark decision, McCollum v. Board of Education, that barred religious instruction in public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court in that case decreed: “if courts were ‘to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any [group] or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds.’”
It’s unclear “how a court could decide that one parent’s views on gender identity have greater weight than another’s on vegetarianism, modest dress, or sci-fi novels,” the attorneys wrote.
Heaps also had argued that the school’s policy interfered with his right to direct his child’s medical care. She has been diagnosed with depression, high-functioning autism, and anxiety, and Heaps told the court she was in therapy.
But that “therapy” was provided by a pastoral counselor with no medical license, Shah and Verma noted. The state’s attorneys also argued that the child wasn’t diagnosed with a mental health condition related to gender identity, and calling someone by their preferred pronouns is not medical care.
“The school has not made any medical decision for Heaps’s child or taken away any medical decision from Heaps. The school merely decided not to disregard the student’s voluntary request to be addressed by a particular name and pronouns,” they wrote. “Accepting Heaps’s capacious view of medical care would have destabilizing consequences. If addressing a student by a different name and pronouns (on the student’s own request) is medical care, teachers or school officials would be required to have a medical license to honor that request, even if a parent consented.”
The state has repeatedly tried to get the case tossed as moot because Heaps now homeschools his child, and attorneys on both sides of the fight have said she no longer wants to socially transition.
U.S. District Judge Georgette Castner has denied that request, writing in November that the case is not moot because Heaps wants his daughter to return to the 700-student school, where the policy remains in place and would be enforced.
But Shah and Verma challenged that logic, saying Heaps’ attorneys have said his child has not wanted to change her identity for over a year. Gender identity is neither transitory nor temporary, they added.
“The District Court’s decision effectively rests on the assumption that Jane is likely to flip a switch and seek to socially transition when back in school, thereby reviving Heaps’s concerns and alleged injury,” they wrote. “But such an assumption rings hollow and treats Jane’s gender identity as continually fluid. There is no evidence to support such a belief.”
The appellate court has not scheduled oral arguments in the case.

A bill to repeal a state ban on project labor agreements is part of a ""Build a Stronger Wisconsin"" package that Democratic lawmakers proposed Thursday. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Democrats in the state Legislature began circulating draft legislation Thursday that they said would strengthen the state’s economy by supporting workers and undoing policies that undercut union-represented employees.
The package includes four bills: restoring Wisconsin’s prevailing wage law, repealing a ban on project labor agreements, repealing the state’s “right to work” law, and strengthening laws against wrongly classifying employees as independent contractors.
“We know that these are popular policies that the people of Wisconsin need to be able to thrive in our state,” said Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) at a press conference in the Assembly chamber Thursday morning. “We  have all 60 members of the Assembly Democrats and the Senate Democrats signed onto these bills.”
A crowd of union members and supporters occupied the Assembly, packed in rows where the body’s leaders usually sit as well as bunched throughout the seats that lawmakers typically use during floor sessions.
One draft bill would undo Wisconsin’s “right-to-work” law enacted during former Gov. Scott Walker’s second term. The law bars employers and unions from requiring in their labor contracts that all union-represented employees pay union dues or fees to cover the union’s operational expenses.
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said the law “allows private sector workers to benefit from union protections without paying their share of union dues.” Spreitzer recalled he was in his first Assembly term when the measure was enacted in 2015 and spoke twice against it during an all-night floor session.
“Under federal law, unions are required to represent all employees in a workplace, but right-to-work laws like Wisconsin’s allow non-dues paying employees to receive the benefits of belonging to a union — such as bargain contracts for higher wages and union representation in employment disputes —without having to pay union dues,” Spreitzer said.
“That is not fair. It is well past time to return to the requirement that every union represented worker pays their dues for that privilege in Wisconsin,” he added.
Nurse Colin Gillis, a member of SEIU Wisconsin, called the law’s name “a misnomer.” Union members deride such laws as “right-to-work for less” because they tend to weaken wage gains, he said.
Right-to-work laws were first enacted in the segregated South after World War II. “Right-to-work laws were designed to divide and conquer and prevent us from joining together and increase living standards for working families from all races and backgrounds,” Gillis said. “Repealing ‘right to work for less’ will give me and my union siblings back the freedom to organize.”
A second bill would repeal another Walker-era law, enacted in 2017, that bars state and local governments from requiring contractors on public works projects to sign a project labor agreement with relevant unions. It also forbids government bids that require the bidder to have a union contract.
“Repealing the ban on project labor agreements, or PLAs, gives power to local and state governments to utilize a tool that would streamline the building process for public construction projects,” said Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson).
LeVar Wilson, a journeyman glazer represented by the Painters Union in Milwaukee, said he got his start as an apprentice 25 years ago when the Milwaukee baseball stadium, then known as Miller Park, was being built. The stadium project labor agreement guaranteed a percentage of jobs would go to Milwaukee County residents.
“I was one of those workers hired under this provision,” Wilson said. “It led me to a sustainable career that’s allowed me to raise a family of four without the struggle of poverty that I went through when I was a child.”
A third bill would increase enforcement and penalties for businesses that misclassify workers as independent contractors.
State Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) said that when employers misclassify workers, they dodge state and federal payroll taxes, evade minimum wage laws and overtime payment requirements, and don’t pay into the worker’s compensation and unemployment insurance programs.
“By avoiding these costs, dishonest employers often successfully undercut their competitors with very low bids,” Sinicki said. “In this way, misclassification harms the law-abiding employers and their employees and also the taxpayers who have to pick up the slack.”
The draft bill would increase the penalties for lawbreakers and expand outreach both to contractors and the public about misclassification.
The legislation would “level the playing field for business owners like us, who play by the rules,” said Larry Statz, a second-generation union painting contractor with 30 employees who said that he’s seen more contractors misclassify employees in recent years.
“We refuse to break the law or shortchange our workers. But it’s getting harder to compete with dishonest companies who cut corners,” Statz said. “State laws on misclassification do not have enough teeth in them, and these cheating companies too often avoid being caught.”
The fourth bill would reinstate Wisconsin’s prevailing wage law, which set a standard for what workers on state and local government projects are paid. The prevailing wage law was repealed in the state budget Walker signed in 2017.
State Sen. Bob Wirch (D-Somers) said Republican lawmakers who voted to repeal the law “promised it would save the taxpayers money. Well, the opposite has happened.”
A study published in 2020 by the Midwest Economic Policy Institute found that  in the years that followed the repeal, construction workers’ wages fell by about $2,600 a year and highway construction costs increased.
At the time the report was published, a co-author, economist Kevin Duncan, said that the findings “underscore the longstanding academic consensus” that doing away with prevailing wage requirements leads to a lower-skilled, lower-wage workforce and doesn’t save money.
“Instead, it creates new inefficiencies in the form of workforce turnover, quality, cost overruns and safety problems,” Duncan said in a news release announcing the report. 
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said she has sought to persuade GOP Senate Majority Leader Devin Le Mahieu (R-Oostburg) to pursue bipartisan lawmaking.
“I do not know if the Senate Republicans have caucused on any of these measures, but I’d encourage them to do so,” Hesselbein said.
Neubauer said the Assembly Democrats would continue advocating for the measures, but also tacitly acknowledged that they might not advance until after the 2026 election — when Democratic leaders are hoping to flip one or both chambers.
“We will continue pushing for them as long as it takes,” Neubauer said of the bills. “And if that’s next session, so be it.”

Those seeking temporary humanitarian parole — a process to get legal authorization, used by many who came to Idaho from Afghanistan and Ukraine — will also have to pay a much higher fee to get a work permit. 
Immigration groups ask appeals panel to reinstate refugee programs

Around 550 individuals have resettled in Idaho since last fall, said Holly Beech, communications manager for the Idaho Office for Refugees. As a result of the budget reconciliation package approved July 1, named H.R. 1 or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” many of those individuals who had been using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and have not yet obtained their green card have been removed from the program. 
Refugees in the U.S. will also have their access to health care through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program removed by Oct. 1, 2026. Refugees will also lose eligibility for private health care through the Affordable Care Act on Jan. 1, 2027, and through Medicare Jan. 27, 2027.  
“Providing people access to food and health care benefits has been a pillar of the resettlement program,” Beech said, “because when they’ve first arrived, they’ve often had to flee their home country out of fear for their lives, so they don’t have wealth built up or resources built up….  Those are the really crucial months where those programs mean a lot to people.” 
The removal of food benefits has already gone into effect, but it’s unclear how many people have been affected. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which administers SNAP, told the Sun that the agency can track recipients who were not citizens, but did not immediately provide the number of Idaho refugees who had been using the program before losing eligibility. 
“We’re still awaiting guidance from our federal partner so we don’t have any details yet on how we will be asked to implement the changes in H.R.1.” 
Around 70% of adults who arrive as refugees start working within five months, Beech said, but often the first job upon arrival doesn’t come with health insurance. Refugees must apply for their green card, which would reinstate their eligibility for public assistance, after one year. 
 U.S. senator for Idaho says he’s open to changes to refugee access to public assistance 

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee and was key in authoring much of the version of the Big Beautiful Bill that passed. He supported the bill, but told the Idaho Capital Sun in a recent interview he would be open to reconsidering the revocation of public assistance for refugees.

Crapo said the refugee part of the nearly 900-page law was a “political negotiation.”  
“I wish I could answer it any differently than that,” Crapo said. 
He said he believes another approach could be taken “if we identify a very specific need there that can be resolved.”
“It’s a small population, and it’s one that is legally following the rules,” he said. “It seems to me that is the kind of population that would justify a second look.” 
To be a refugee, people must be referred for consideration to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program; demonstrate persecution or legitimate fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group; and be located outside the U.S. 
A small percentage of those who apply get approval to come to the U.S., Beech said. Seeking asylum follows a similar process, but it is for people to arrive at the U.S. border and apply from within the country. 
 Federal U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service policies slowing green card processing 

Lately, changes at the federal agency that processes Permanent Resident Cards — known as green cards — seem to be slowing down that process, said Beech and Boise-based immigration attorney Chris Christensen. 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or UCIS, paused the processing of all green card applications between March 21 and April 10, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project. Beech said the office’s resettlement partners are also reporting continued delays in processing in the residency documentation.

Some people with temporary protected status who received work authorization are getting held up or have not been able to have their parole renewed. The U.S. previously established parole programs, which allowed temporary legal status for citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela with a confirmed U.S.-supporter. 
The temporary status was valid for two years and could be renewed. However, the federal government terminated the program and did not allow new parole to be granted. 
“People came here legally, are working hard, are providing for their families, and these delays are really impeding their ability to do that,” Beech said. 
People who applied for asylum in the U.S. are also facing long delays. 
Christensen, the immigration attorney, noted that the backlog of asylum cases was already long, but the Trump administration also fired a number of immigration judges or offered deferred resignation, PBS reported. 
He has clients who first applied for asylum in 2015 and are still awaiting an interview, he said.

 Fees added or significantly increased for asylees and parolees 

The large tax and spending bill also significantly increased fees for a number of asylum seekers. For instance, there used to be no cost to apply for asylum, but the new law implemented a $100 fee for an application and an additional $100 annual fee for each year the application remains pending. 
“Most people seeking asylum are fleeing persecution. They often leave with just the clothes on their back, and now there’s a $100 filing fee in order to apply for asylum,” Christensen said. 
He called the annual fee a “disincentive for the government to quickly adjudicate those cases.” 
Asylum applicants used to also be able to file for their first work permit free, Christensen said, and now that fee is $550. The fee for a green card more than doubled to $2,940 if applying in immigration court. 
Before the law, there was no fee for special immigrant juvenile cases, in which a court has determined a child has been abused, abandoned or neglected by their parents and that it is not in the best interest of the child to go back to their country of origin. That fee is now $250. 
These fees were implemented quickly upon the passage of the budget reconciliation on July 4. It happened so quickly, that there isn’t yet a mechanism to pay the $100 asylum fee in immigration court, Christensen said. 
“I’m afraid the administration may use this to make it complicated enough to pay, that people miss paying and their cases get denied simply on that basis,” he said. 
 Lost Medicaid coverage adds to new Idaho limitations on refugee medical assistance 

Refugees without a green card will lose health care coverage October 2026, and as of this July, some refugees in Idaho have already lost access to some medical services. 
The Idaho Legislature this year passed a law that limited the income eligibility for the state Refuge Medical Assistance Program, the Sun reported. House Bill 199 decreased the income eligibility for the program to 133% of the federal poverty level from its previous cap of 150%. 
The Refugee Medical Assistance program is a federally funded program that provides short-term medical coverage for refugees who aren’t eligible for Medicaid, according to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement.
Without either access, it’s unclear how certain required medical screenings will be paid for. Among many of the strict conditions for refugee resettlement is a requirement to receive a medical screening upon arrival and again when they receive their green card, Beech said. 
Medicaid and the refugee medical assistance typically has covered the cost of this screening, she said, and it’s unclear how it will be paid for if the refugee cannot afford it. 
Refugees without green cards and asylees will join the estimated tens of thousands of Idahoans who are predicted to lose access to health care because of provisions in the bill, the Sun previously reported. 
Health care advocates have estimated that many Idahoans will lose access to Medicaid because of recent work requirements — a policy the state of Idaho had already sought to implement before the federal tax and spending bill — and another 35,000 Idahoans are expected to lose health insurance coverage because Congress did not extend the enhanced premium tax credits. Those credits reduced health care premiums through the insurance marketplace established in the Affordable Care Act. 
Crapo and fellow U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, have said the changes to Medicaid will preserve the program for those it was intended to help, including pregnant women, children, seniors and those with disabilities. 
Beech said the idea behind all of the programs, including the public assistance, offered to refugees is to set up new residents for success, and it’s been shown to be successful over the last 45 years. 
She cited a National Bureau of Economic Research study that found refugees in the U.S. ending up paying significantly more in taxes than they received in public benefits in their first 20 years in the country. 
“It’s an investment in people, and it’s an investment in our communities,” Beech said. “I am concerned to know that these two, the food and health care portions, of that support that they receive when they’re brand new here, I’m concerned about what it will mean to not have access to those anymore.”

Laramie and Platte County commissioners selected Love to represent a Senate seat vacated by Trump appointee. 
The post A Q&A with Cheyenne’s Taft Love, Wyoming’s newest state senator appeared first on WyoFile .","Taft Love of Cheyenne will be sworn in Tuesday as a state lawmaker, filling a vacancy in Senate District 6 left by Darin Smith, who President Donald Trump nominated as U.S. Attorney for the District of Wyoming. 
Love, a rancher and business owner, previously served on the Laramie County School District 2 Board and as chairman of the Laramie County GOP. 
Senate District 6 encompasses Platte County and a rural swath of northeastern Laramie County. The process to fill its vacancy began late last month with a meeting in Guernsey, where GOP precinct committee members nominated Love alongside Roy Birt of Wheatland and Jeff Barnes of Cheyenne. 
Last week, the two counties’ commissioners gathered in Cheyenne to make the final determination, selecting Love out of the three nominees. 
Love was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up the son of a Navy man. When he graduated from high school as Indiana’s bareback rodeo champion, a Laramie County Community College coach recruited him to ride bucking horses. 
Love went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in wildlife management and range management from the University of Wyoming. He worked for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department as a biologist and in the state’s former tourism division before starting several businesses, including a construction company and TKO Ranch.

Love and his wife, Jill, have three children. 
In 2024, he ran in the Republican primary against Smith and four other candidates for the district he will soon represent. He said he plans to run again in 2026 to keep the seat. 
WyoFile spoke with Love by phone Thursday ahead of his swearing in. 
WyoFile: Starting about halfway through the term, how are you preparing for the job? 
Sen.-Elect Taft Love: Really, the appointment is going to impact the budget year, and then we’ll have to run again next year. Then if we win that seat, it will sustain for two years, and then we’ll have to run again, and it’ll go back on its normal four-year schedule. So there’s actually a pretty aggressive schedule to make sure the people have the say as quickly as possible in this. Barring a special election though, we still go through the appointment process, and the appointment is truly focused on the budget session. And so what I did is I dove into the Platte and Laramie County budgets and the state of Wyoming budget and the supplemental budget to make sure I understood where we were at and what was being presented as we move forward. 
I understand there’s another property tax [proposal] that is being presented to the voters in this election cycle as well. The voters will determine what happens with this. I know counties are extremely concerned about additional property tax cuts because it’s going to start impacting their infrastructure. And it may actually start putting faces to the cuts, because you can only go so deep before, you know, personnel is, in general, the largest expenditure of most government agencies. So it’s hard to cut too many things before you get to the point where you have to start cutting personnel.
WF: Unlike Laramie County, Platte County is a hardship county, so it generates lower revenues and that can make it challenging to fund public services. Do you think the Legislature has been sensitive to Wyoming’s hardship counties, particularly when it comes to property tax cuts?
TL: I think they keep it in mind. I think if the intention is to continue to do deeper tax cuts on property tax then I’m not sure one-size-fits-all is going to work anymore for some of those poorer counties that — and I don’t want to say poorer counties, I want to say that they have less revenue than what others have. Such as Platte County, they don’t have a lot of the minerals and petroleum and those revenues coming in, where Laramie County does. And so I absolutely think we have to be cautious as we move forward and make sure those counties are able to sustain their essential services for sure.

WF: What role, if any, should the Wyoming Legislature play in economic development?
TL: I don’t believe we’re supposed to pick winners and losers in economic development. I think that we set the framework at the 30,000-foot view, and we allow our local governing bodies to make those decisions as far as recruiting and bringing businesses into the state of Wyoming. They are best suited to know what fits their community and their community needs in that growth-and-development scenario. So I think the state needs to stay at that 30,000-foot view and not pick winners and losers.
WF: Having served on the Laramie County School District 2 Board, you’ll be able to bring the perspective of local government to the Legislature, where there’s been an evolving conversation about local control. I’m wondering how well you think lawmakers have followed the conservative principle of local control in recent years?
TL: I do think that everybody feels strongly about local control, and the best government is the government closest to the people. And I intend to uphold that as I move through the process, and be very cognizant of that as I try to make decisions.
WF: You mentioned in Guernsey that education would be a priority of yours as a lawmaker. Can you elaborate on any specific ideas related to education that you’d like to pursue?
TL: I have not started with any specific bill draft ideas. I’ve got a few in mind. I’m going to hold those until I can develop them a little bit more. There’s a lot that can be done in education, and as we work towards the defederalization of our education system and more of a state-run and state-guided education system, I think Wyoming lawmakers are going to have the ability to make influence into that. And maybe there’s an opportunity for us to get more efficient, both economically and in the education itself of our children, and make sure that we are industry ready when we’re graduating from high school, and any trade schools that we might have going on as well. We need to very much focus on making sure that we’re meeting the industry needs with the graduates. And so there’s a tremendous opportunity to be able to grow and to write some new laws and take some new opportunities in those areas.

WF: And related to that, Wyoming has a youth exodus problem. What, if anything, should the Legislature do to keep young people here?
TL: Business recruitment and entertainment are the two things that are going to keep our kids here. And so making sure we have an inviting tax structure that allows growth of small business in our communities, and making sure that we recognize the needs of those communities, making sure our land use, land-use regulation, water and [the Department of Environmental Quality,] the state engineers office — the DEQ do a great job of helping guide those paths. And we need to be creative in the way we make opportunity for new industries to come into our communities, so that our kids have the opportunities to stay and not have to seek jobs outside of the state. That’s the age-old question in Wyoming is, “How do we retain our children?” I think as time grows and things change, we need to figure out ways to protect some of our legacy ag and ranching industry. We need to find ways and be creative in how we can maintain a good, healthy growth and keep Wyoming’s values in that growth. And that’s the true challenge we see. I’ve watched other areas of the nation where their values have deteriorated in certain areas based on what has been allowed through their legal system. And so I think we have to be really cautious as we grow our communities.
WF: Lawmakers have spent a lot of time in recent years aiming to overhaul the state’s election system. One thing they have not pursued is a ban on mail-in ballots. Last month, the Trump administration announced it plans to prohibit states from using mail-in ballots. I’m wondering, do you think that kind of restriction would be a good fit in Wyoming, where a lot of residents cast their ballots by mail?
TL: So mail-in ballots by and large, I think it’s another one of those things where you can’t use a one-size-fits-all. I think we have elderly communities that it will be very difficult for some of them to go to a polling location. I think we have disabled veterans that are going to have issue with that. We have traveling veterans and military personnel that are not going to be able to get there. There’s a good place for the use of mail-in ballots, and I think we can be careful with how we do that. And so I’ll be anxious to see what’s presented. And I guess I’d withhold any decision until I’m able to see the full documentation on it. 
WF: You’ve been an active member of the Wyoming Republican Party, having recently served as Laramie County GOP chairman. I want to ask you about the divide among Republicans about who is a true conservative and who isn’t. Where do you fit into that conversation?
TL: I’m really disappointed to see the divide inside of the Republican Party. And by and large, I believe most of everybody who calls themselves a Republican in the state of Wyoming has conservative values. And they agree on probably 80 or 90% of the platform, and what we need to be doing. The issue we have is that we’re spending 90% of our time talking about the 10% we don’t agree on, instead of doing the business of the people and working together for the 90% we do agree on.
WF: What else would you like your constituents to know about you?
TL: I am very honored to be serving and grateful for the opportunity and that I will be present in their communities, and that my email and phone are open to them anytime they need to reach out. I intend to be there for different community functions and opportunities, and I want to hear about their concerns. I’m very much here to serve the people of Senate District 6.

(Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)By Chris Porrino
Now that the gubernatorial nominees have been chosen, we can expect to hear more about their leadership philosophies. One issue that likely will garner little attention but will have far-reaching implications is this: Should the new governor strictly enforce Executive Order No. 6, issued by Gov. Jim Florio in 1990, which requires that all state departments and agencies rely exclusively on the attorney general for legal counsel?
At first glance, this may seem like a bureaucratic detail. In practice, the question of who advises state officials on the law can significantly shape how decisions are made, how policies are implemented, and how much authority the governor actually wields. When that legal counsel is the attorney general — a lawyer nominated by and almost always an ally of the governor — the governor will possess greater power and control over state agencies and departments. On the other hand, when EO 6 is not enforced, legal advice will be dispensed by lawyers within the departments and agencies themselves, affording greater independence.
There are pros and cons to both approaches, and different governors have taken different paths on this infrequently discussed subject. I can tell you from personal experience, as a former director of the division of law (which acts for the attorney general as the “law firm” to the state), former chief counsel to Gov. Chris Christie, and attorney general of New Jersey, very few matters of consequence in state government happen without the involvement of legal counsel. I therefore urge the current candidates to make a purposeful choice on this issue after careful consideration and discussion with prior administrations.
 The case for strict enforcement

Enforcement of EO 6 across the board creates a potentially very powerful benefit for the next governor — in a state that already has one of the most powerful governorships in the nation. Requiring that all legal advice be obtained from the Attorney General’s Office consolidates legal strategy under one roof, making it far easier to ensure that departments and agencies are carrying out a unified policy agenda. When agency heads rely on “in-house” counsel who report only to them, not to the attorney general, legal advice can easily become siloed or even adversarial to the governor’s goals. EO 6, if applied rigorously, reestablishes a more hierarchical chain of command — one that strengthens the governor’s ability to lead and better achieve his or her policy objectives.
Of course, this all assumes that the attorney general is aligned with the governor on key policy issues, and that the attorney general’s leadership team spends the necessary time to ensure that the legal advice being given to different departments helps advance the administration’s agenda. While the attorney general is appointed by the governor and usually has close ties to him or her, New Jersey’s unique constitutional structure gives the attorney general considerable independence once confirmed. If the attorney general diverges from the governor’s views — or takes a more cautious or differently motivated legal approach — there is little the governor can do to override that legal advice.
 The drawbacks

Yet there are significant potential downsides to enforcing the order without flexibility. Most department and agency leaders — whether in human services, environmental protection, corrections, or transportation — prefer having legal advisors embedded within their leadership teams. These internal counsel often possess expertise tailored to the specialized operations and day-to-day legal needs of their departments in ways that an externally assigned deputy attorney general may not.
Moreover, in-house counsel are often seen as trusted strategic partners, helping shape decisions in real time. In many cases, in-house counsel are hand-picked by the relevant commissioner and the Governor’s Office, ensuring that they are ideological adherents of the administration’s agenda as opposed to career civil servants in the Attorney General’s Office. Removing in-house counsel could lead to slower responses, reduced innovation, and a sense of detachment from legal strategy. In a state government as complex as New Jersey’s, a one-size-fits-all model may sacrifice practicality for formal control.
 Finding the balance

The next governor must weigh these competing considerations carefully.
This is not just a governance issue. It is a question of how power flows, how leadership is exercised, and how effectively New Jersey can respond to the challenges of modern state government and its frequent interaction with the business community and citizen advocates. After prevailing on Election Day, the next governor would be wise to revisit this foundational issue during the transition — not just to reassert control, but to build a more cohesive, responsive, and strategically aligned executive branch. While this decision won’t make headlines, it may determine the success of the new administration.

On a Labor Day adventure, a WyoFile reporter and his editor unknowingly traversed a high-density snake zone.
The post Wyoming rattler road trip appeared first on WyoFile .","Fall’s cooler temperatures send Wyoming’s prairie rattlesnakes slithering home to hang out closer to their dens.
“Your highest occurrence of crossing paths with the rattlesnake is going to be May, June, July, August and September,” said Matt Rasmussen, vice president of the Wyoming Herpetological Society. 
For ophidiophobes — those with a fear of snakes — hoping for a firm date, when all rattlers tuck themselves in for winter, Rasmussen says there is no such thing.  
“You can expect to see a rattlesnake in most of Wyoming below about 7,200 feet until there’s snow on the ground, because even if there’s a warm day, they can be out,” Rasmussen said. “I’ve seen rattlesnakes every month in Wyoming, except for December, January and February, but that’s typically because I look for them and I like them, and I’m going to where they are.”
Driving the backroads between Pathfinder Reservoir and the town of Medicine Bow, WyoFile reporter Andrew Graham and his editor had a near miss with two rattlers within a few miles. 
“That particular area of Wyoming is the highest density of rattlesnakes anywhere in the state,” Rasmussen said. “And it’s one of the highest densities of rattlesnakes anywhere in the country.” 
The Shirley Basin’s rock pile hills and lower elevation mountains are home to huge rattlesnake dens, Rasmussen said. 
He’s heard talk of rattlers traveling 3 miles from their dens, and is certain they can range up to a mile.

The WyoFile staffers were delighted to catch a glimpse of snakes slithering and sunbathing from the safety of their pickups. The first snake was more of a brunette, while the second leaned blonde. 
“They’re highly variable in their phenotype and appearance,” Rasmussen said. “Their name, Crotalus viridis, is green rattlesnake. And some of ours that we have here are extremely green. They’re just beautiful — glowing chartreuse and green. And others, they’re just chocolate or gray or kind of muted sandy colors. In the same area, in the same population, there’s wide, wide variability in their appearance.”
If you see one, and you don’t want to get bitten, all you have to do is walk away. Rasmussen advises: “A snake will never chase anyone.”
But seeing them is key? 
“You cannot see a rattlesnake if it doesn’t want to be seen,” Rasmussen said. “But you can see the sagebrush that it likes to coil underneath. You can see that small pile of rocks out in the prairie that it likes to hang out by. So if you can identify these small, sun-dappled, shaded areas where they could feel comfortable, and you avoid those, you’ll be fine.” 
Rasmussen stands by that advice even after being bit by a rattlesnake last year. 
“It was a complete one in a million fluke,” Rasmussen said. “I work for the railroad in eastern Wyoming and I knelt down to pick up something in between the ties, and it was underneath the foot of the rail, and it got me.” 
That painful encounter — which he said left his arm looking like a football — didn’t undermine Rasmussen’s admiration. 
“They are an important part of our ecosystem,” Rasmussen said. 
Many humans appreciate them for eating rodents, Rasmussen said, but the benefits extend beyond pest control. “They’re proven to be seed dispersers, because they don’t digest those seeds that are in the stomach of the rodents that they eat.”
He said they’re also an important food source for other animals from badgers and bobcats to raptors and hawks. 
“They’re just really cool,” Rasmussen exclaimed. “I mean, it’s an animal with no legs that lives in a state that gets down to 30 below. They’re only active typically for three or four months of the year and can live for over 20 years with that activity level. And there’s been studies that some adults only eat once a year.”

When dictators decide to take over a nation, the first thing they do is purge their government of anyone that doesn’t kow-tow to their ideological mandates.  Then they target the intellectuals, the press and those who raise dissent over their loss of freedoms – including individuals, businesses, universities, and political opponents.
Then they turn the military against their own citizens to crush any thoughts of protest while weaponizing the government against any entities that resist the crushing jackboot on their necks.
If this sounds mighty familiar these days, there are far too many reasons to list in one column.  In truth, the American people are now largely in shock at what the historically unpopular president is doing to our country — and to the total disregard of the ethics and norms so many have taken for granted. 
We have taken pride that our still very young nation was founded and operates on three “separate but equal” branches of government that are supposed to provide the checks and balances to contain abuse by any one branch.  But the supposed balance of the legislative, executive and judicial branches no longer exists.
Historically, the executive branch implements the laws and spends the appropriated funding as per Congressional intent.  Only now, through the administration’s legally dubious process of recission, billions in congressionally approved funds are being cut and/or redirected from their intended use. And in far too many instances, it’s being intentionally done as punishment for universities, cities, states, businesses or Congressional members’ districts that do not support the dictatorial mandates of the White House.  
This week a federal judge ruled the White House illegally froze billions of dollars in research funds for Harvard, writing:  “A review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”  
And that’s just the tip of the abuses emanating from the executive. 
In the meantime, the National Guard that was sent to Washington, D.C., from so-called red states to supposedly “restore order” is mostly picking up litter — at a cost to taxpayers of a million bucks a day with no end in sight. 
Chicago is next on the list of “blue state” cities that will enjoy the freedom of having armed American soldiers on their streets based on the hyper-sensitized claim by the president that it’s “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.”  But many other cities have higher crime rates and the shootings and homicides in Chicago are down by more than 30% this year alone — the fourth year of declines. 
Following the dictator’s pattern, the press has been in the crosshairs with outrageous bribes being demanded by the administration.  Meanwhile, press and social media outlets are threatened with investigations, shut-downs, and lawsuits from their own government.  And those that publish news, facts, or positions unfavorable to the administration are the primary targets of retribution. 
Montanans hold individual privacy a sacrosanct “Inalienable right” along with popular sovereignty, self government, individual dignity, freedom of assembly, religion, speech, expression, and press.  We likewise prohibit any random search and/or seizure of our citizens as well as their “papers, electronic data and communications, homes and effects.”
On the last day of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Ben Franklin was asked: “What have we got a republic or a monarchy?”  He replied: “A republic, if you can keep it.”  Right now “keeping it” is a daunting and unprecedented challenge — and one at which which we must not fail.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9310-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-05 06:57:23.578626

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A survey of higher education faculty in the South found that professors are most worried about political influence, with many considering employment elsewhere. 
The American Association of University Professors survey of approximately 4,000 faculty members was conducted in August. Respondents are members of the association’s chapters in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. About 200 were from Louisiana. 
The survey found professors are deeply dissatisfied with the state of higher education in their states and are looking for employment outside the South. 
The same survey last year found that salary was the main reason faculty were considering leaving.

Professors also reported they fear teaching about climate change, feminism and other topics extreme conservatives have put in their crosshairs when attacking universities they consider “too woke.” 
There is a “fear of talking openly about academic findings that may contradict political ideology,” one associate professor in Georgia said in their survey response. 
In addition to higher education-specific concerns, such as attacks on tenure and removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, some faculty cited anti-LGBTQ+ state laws and abortion bans among their reasons for wanting to leave the South. 
LSU isn’t recording complaints from student athletes in most sports 

The survey also found that 17% of faculty have had their syllabi or curriculum choices questioned by university administrators. Another 10% said their grants or federal contracts were ended by the Trump administration. 
Over half of respondents said they would not recommend their state as a desirable place to work and almost 40% said they had witnessed a tangible effect on hiring. 
Approximately a quarter of all professors surveyed – and over 29% of all Louisiana professors – said they are considering leaving their jobs.
LSU Board of Supervisors Chairman Scott Ballard pushed back on the idea that politicians have an outsized influence on universities. 
“Your elected officials will always have an opinion,” Ballard said at a board committee meeting Thursday. “I don’t get orders.” 
“Good luck going anywhere where your elected officials aren’t involved,” Ballard added. 
Multiple professors in Louisiana reported fear that something they say in class could be recorded and posted out of context on social media, sparking backlash from politicians, as happened in the case of two LSU law professors last year. 
“My colleague (tenured, full professor) was summarily suspended without a hearing or any form of due process based on a student complaint that he verbally criticized the Governor and President in a joking way with off-color language in his first class of the semester,” one full professor wrote in response to a survey question. “We’re terrified, which is the goal. “
The professor’s response refers to Ken Levy, an LSU law professor who was removed from the classroom after a student posted a video of him making critical and profane comments about Gov. Jeff Landry, leading to Landry calling for him to be fired.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is accepting public comments on recent pay rate cuts for health care providers who treat Medicaid patients. 
Last month, the state health agency announced it would cut Medicaid reimbursement rates for all provider types and services by 4%, starting Sept. 1. The news came a week after Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered state agencies to cut budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall.
The Medicaid cuts are meant to reduce rapidly rising Medicaid costs, and more could come, state officials said. But said the cuts — coupled with another Medicaid program set to end soon — could push some doctors’ offices to stop accepting Medicaid, Idaho Medical Association CEO Susie Keller previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.

The cuts took effect Monday, but Health and Welfare is working with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “to clarify operational expectations with any claims needing to be reprocessed,” agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
At the Idaho Legislature’s Medicaid Review Panel’s Wednesday meeting, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron said “making changes to this proposal is not out of the question.”
“What we expect to see and dig into — in addition to some folks just saying we disagree with this — is ‘are there specific access or impact concerns within specific communities that we need to look at?’” she said in response to a question from a lawmaker. “For example, maybe it’s a specific home and community-based service in a very rural community.”
Here’s how the cuts will work, according to Health and Welfare’s announcement last month:

The providers: That includes hospitals, nursing and intermediate care facilities, home and community-based services for people with disabilities, hospice, ambulatory surgical centers, school-based services and more. Pharmacy benefit rates will also face 4% cuts. Tribal providers will be exempt from the cuts, since they are “reimbursed entirely with federal funds when serving tribal members.”
Managed care: Payments to private companies that manage Medicaid benefits will also be cut by 4%. The cuts to those payments, called capitation rates, may come through “provider rate reductions or changes to optional covered costs.” Some Idaho Medicaid services — like mental health care, medical transportation and dental care — are run by private managed care organizations. Idaho hopes to shift all Medicaid benefits to managed care by 2029, under a state law passed this year.

(Getty Images)My name is Raymond O’Dell. I am a Boise resident, a veteran and I receive my medical care at the Boise VA. 
For some time now there has been an effort by the federal government to privatize veterans’ health care. If you’ve been watching the news, you will see that the Trump administration has put this effort in the fast lane. The intent seems to be to bust the VA union (done), critically understaff VA facilities (done) and divert VA funding to “community care” (done). In other words, cripple VA health care to the point of failure in order to justify complete privatization. 
Proposed cuts to the VA will limit health care access for our Idaho veterans. They deserve better.

You may ask, what is wrong with privatizing VA care? In Idaho it would be catastrophic. The Boise VA sees over 40,000 patients per year and provides veteran specific care related to conditions such as burn pit exposure, Agent Orange, post-traumatic stress and loss of limbs. This care extends from Salmon to Twin Falls and Ontario to Idaho Falls. The impact on Idaho communities cannot be overstated. 
Idaho ranks 50th among states in the number of doctors per capita. Communities throughout Idaho are experiencing a severe shortage of primary care physicians, specialty physicians and nurses. This can be attributed to many factors, among them, Idaho reproductive rights laws, Medicaid cuts and the lack of medical schools in the state. 
This equates to Idaho citizens competing with one another in a literal health care abyss. When you throw in 40,000 plus veterans who have lost their VA care it further floods a severely flooded system. Community residents suddenly find themselves competing with not only their neighbors for care but also competing with thousands of veterans for care. 
VA health care providers are oftentimes veterans themselves and understand the special needs of veterans. All VA health care providers are specially trained in the physical and psychological needs of the veterans they care for. This cannot be said of care outside of VA facilities. 
Job loss is another consequence of privatization. The Boise VA employs approximately 1,500 Treasure Valley residents of which one third are veterans themselves. The health care cuts mentioned previously are more than likely to cause those employees to leave the state in order to find employment. The ones who stay will find themselves in a flooded local job market outside of health care. 
The Boise VA is a teaching hospital and major training ground for physician residents, nurses and other health care professionals. Nationwide, a large percentage of health care professionals receive part of their training through VA programs, and the availability of residency slots is a major limiting factor in how many physicians can be trained, eliminating the VA would be a serious blow. Eliminating the Boise VA would seriously hinder the ability to train and maintain doctors in the Treasure Valley. 
I have shared an awareness of all this information with our elected leaders from the Boise city mayor (who was very receptive) to our Idaho congressional delegation and most everyone in between. Except for Mayor Lauren McLean’s office, most were unconcerned and continue to give “lip service” and promises that are not reflected in their priorities or their votes. For example, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, would have you believe “Community Care” is the answer and blames Joe Biden, invoking partisanship when the problem is resources. 
It is my position that they need to be proactive. By the time they become reactive it will be too late. I do NOT want our elected officials to be able to say “I had no idea this would happen.” Let it be known that they have been informed. What they do with that information will be on them.

(Getty Images)After 30 years as a teacher, Cathy Proctor, 72, is still working at a nearby Malden Elementary school as a substitute. She said the money is necessary to pay for groceries and growing medical bills after her husband became ill.
Plus, she’s going to pay more for her health insurance through the Public Employees Insurance Agency, which is offered to retired state employees. 
In July, sweeping premium hikes went into effect for PEIA participants and some retirees as the program has struggled for years to stay afloat financially. The program provides health insurance coverage for teachers, state employees and more. 
“It angers me,” said Proctor, who lives in Rand, W.Va. “I feel like this part of my life that I gave meant nothing to them.”










I feel like this part of my life that I gave meant nothing to them.


– Cathy Proctor


She added, “If they are in trouble financially, there’s other avenues they could go without  tacking everything on us.”
PEIA premium hikes are supposed to make up an estimated $113 million gap for the coming fiscal year because medical and prescription drug expenses have outpaced the program’s budget. 
While Gov. Patrick Morrisey has floated the idea of a special session this month to “fix” PEIA, the governor and the GOP-supermajority Legislature can’t seem to reach a consensus. 
PEIA premiums are increasing by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. 
The agency will also raise premiums by 12% for the 42,000 retirees enrolled in PEIA. The premium increase went into effect for retirees not on Medicare in July; retirees using Medicare will see the increase Jan 1.
“I know living on this fixed income, which we get no raises, it’s tough on retirees, especially if they increase the PEIA rates on us,” said Robin Beamer Dalton, of Princeton. Dalton taught school in Mercer County for 33 years before she retired in 2015. Because she has a Medicare plan in addition to PEIA, Dalton’s PEIA rates will increase early next year.
Dalton, a widow, said she’s trying to cut expenses in anticipation of the rate increase, but she hasn’t ruled out the possibility of finding a part-time job to help cover it. 
“I don’t want to [work], because I feel like — well, I have worked over half my life,” she said. I just lost my husband four and a half months ago. I feel like I need to be home.”

Lawmakers should allocate $10M to reverse retiree price hike, senator says 
A spokesperson for the state Department of Administration said the average increase for retirees in the program depends on the individual’s years of service and type of coverage. 
She explained that, for example, a Medicare policyholder with single coverage and 25 years of service will see a $10 increase, while a non-Medicare family plan will see a $76 increase.  
PEIA co-pays for certain medical services and prescription drugs increases, too.
When asked if PEIA leaders were considering reversing these changes for retirees, the department spokesperson said, “This continues to be an ongoing dialogue between the administration and PEIA. With the increasing costs of health care and recent shifts in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans, these changes are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the plan.”
State lawmakers wrapped up their legislative session in April, exiting the Capitol without any action on PEIA while the price hikes loomed. 
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia, said he’s working on gathering support for lawmakers to gather in October to allocate $10 million to reverse the PEIA premium hike for retirees. It’s not part of Morrisey’s alleged PEIA special session plan; the governor can call a special session or lawmakers can with the support of three-fifths in both the House and Senate. 
“These are the folks who have cleaned our schools and state office buildings for decades. They’ve been our school bus drivers, they’ve been our school cooks,” Oliverio said, adding that these retirees are typically on fixed incomes.
He added, “A budget of $5 billion, a surplus of $280 million — surely we could find $10 million to hold off these premium increases on these folks who have served our state and our citizens for many, many years … The Legislature could come in, one day in October, suspend the rules and pass this.”
Morrisey has proposed a plan to “fix” PEIA, MetroNews reported. It includes establishing a new plan for new employees; removing coverage eligibility for spouses who are offered health insurance through their own employer; and establishing a PEIA fraud unit. Retirees weren’t mentioned. 
In July, Morrisey’s spokesperson told West Virginia Watch that the governor would “look to find solutions for all who receive coverage, including retirees.”
The possible PEIA-focused special session could start as early as Sunday since lawmakers will gather in Charleston for September legislative interim meetings. 
Dalton said officials should consider using the state’s surplus to give retired workers a raise. 
“There are people that have been retired longer than me that we never get a wage increase unless it’s Social Security, which they take part of that for insurance so you really don’t get much,” she said. 
For Proctor, the premium hike comes as she is helping her husband recover from a serious illness that requires a list of medications. 
“Every time I turn around, utilities are going up … everything is just piling up,” she said, adding that she turns to her faith and prayer in these times. 
“God is in control, he provides our needs,” she said.

(Getty Images photo)Gov. Tony Evers is on a back-to-school tour, visiting classrooms around the state and touting the budget deal he recently struck with Republicans after declaring 2025 the “Year of the Kid.” Evers “proudly signed a pro-kid, bipartisan state budget into law earlier this summer that invests nearly $1.4 billion in spendable revenue for K-12 schools,” according to a press release from his office celebrating Back to School Week.
You would never know from that announcement that the amount of new general aid schools receive from the state in the current, two-year budget cycle is exactly zero. Or that, as a result, about 70% of school districts across the state are starting the year with less money in the budget than they got in the last, austerity-level biennial budget deal. 
True, the budget includes a total of about $500 million in special education funding, with the state increasing the share of special ed costs it covers from less than 30% to 42% in the first year and 45% of costs in the second year. As Evers’ office puts it, that’s “the largest increase to the special education reimbursement rate in state history.” But it follows decades of decline and amounts to one-half of the 90% reimbursement rate under former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and significantly less than the 60% Evers originally proposed. And the zeroed-out general aid from the state seriously undermines the impact of those long-awaited special education funds. 
The lion’s share of the $1.4 billion in “spendable revenue” Evers is celebrating comes in the form of increased taxing authority the state gave to local school districts — meaning the amount by which they are allowed to raise local property taxes to cover their costs. But local property taxpayers are getting weary of the constantly increasing demand on them to pay more for schools, and local school officials are dismayed that the state did so little to take on some of that cost.
Since special education is a federally mandated expense, the state’s shrinking reimbursement rate has taken a heavy toll on all school programs. For years, schools across Wisconsin have had to cut art, music, sports and other programs to pay a larger and larger share of special ed expenses. That’s why, at budget hearings throughout the state, so many people showed up to say a top priority for the new budget was an increase in the state’s share of special ed. 
“But never did anyone in those budget hearings come to the mic and say, ‘you should either give us general aid or special ed funding,” says Heather DuBois Bourenane, director of the Wisconsin Public Education Network, a statewide group that lobbies for public schools.
DuBois Bourenane says she’s already been getting calls asking her to help local communities put together springtime referendum campaigns asking local property taxpayers for more money on top of what the budget allows them to raise — something that’s never before happened this early in the year. She predicts another record-breaking year of school referendum efforts. Meanwhile, “we’re hearing in some districts they’re afraid to use the authority because local taxes are so high,” she says. “They’re talking about cuts.”
“It’s scary,” she adds. “The belt-tightening is going to be really bad.”
Advocates and school leaders had high hopes that Evers, a former science teacher and state superintendent, would fight to adequately fund public schools. Determined to get a deal, and negotiating with Republicans who seemed all too willing to let schools starve, Evers got what he felt was the best deal he could. And now he’s selling that deal as a good one. But the victory lap is misleading. Public school leaders across the state say the budget leaves teachers, students and local taxpayers in a bad situation. 
“Allowing an increase is one thing — paying for it is another,” LaCrosse News8000.com TV reporter Allyson Fergot explained in a story on how the state budget leaves schools strapped. “This summer lawmakers opted not to fund [a per pupil school funding] increase with state money, so if districts want it, they’ll have to raise district property taxes.”
“The state of Wisconsin currently has a $4.2 billion surplus, but no new general state aid has been provided to help schools meet rising costs,” Madison Metropolitan School District Superintendent Joe Gothard told Wisconsin Public Radio.
How did this happen?
During the budget debate, it was clear that Republicans were outraged by Evers’ line-item veto of the 2023-25 state budget, which extended a provision that increased the amount by which school districts could raise property taxes for the next 400 years.
In retaliation, Republicans promised that there would be no new state aid for schools in the current budget. And they stuck to their word. Wisconsin kids, not Evers, will pay the price of that maneuver. Clearly, it didn’t pay off. 
“It did real harm,” DuBois Bourenane says of Evers’ 400-year-veto. “This was a spite budget. It was petty.” And it wasn’t worth it: The amount of the increase Evers locked in for the next four centuries, at $325 per kid, didn’t even cover inflation. Overall, spending on schools in Wisconsin hasn’t kept pace with inflation for nearly two decades.
“We’re about a little over $3,000 short per kid just because of inflation over the past years,” Cochrane-Fountain City Superintendent Troy White told News8000.com
Could Evers have held out for a better deal? DuBois Bourenane thinks so. She was impressed by the massive public outpouring of support for schools at budget hearings, and the way public pressure helped shape bipartisan consensus on the need to support schools, take the burden off property taxpayers and increase state funding for special ed.
“And schools still came out with nothing,” she says.
When you add in the massive increases in funding for private schools through the state’s voucher programs, the outlook at the start of this school year is grim.
As the state mulls whether to accept a federal voucher program that has the potential to turbocharge the already rapidly expanding system of taxpayer-supported private schools, the Wisconsin Public Education Network is launching a voucher transparency project this month, to help taxpayers get a clear picture of how much they are spending on school vouchers on their property tax bills.
Meanwhile, “everyone should call their legislators and give them the numbers on how much less their districts are coming back to school with,” says DuBois Bourenane. “We need more leaders to do what they can with the leverage they can to fix this.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-681888015-e1579578237667.jpg,,,2025-09-05 06:57:23.578626

A week after saying he wasn’t considering deploying National Guard troops to Memphis or Nashville, Gov. Bill Lee reportedly said this week anything is possible. 
The waffling came amid increased calls for troops to patrol the streets of Tennessee’s bluest cities, even though last week Lee referred to statistics showing a 15% decrease in Memphis crime to explain why the Bluff City didn’t need troops on patrol. The governor said increased efforts by Tennessee law enforcement with local and federal agencies combined to cut down on criminal incidents.










Sen. (Brent) Taylor reportedly says in an interview that even though he hasn’t ‘seen any evidence’ that MPD is reclassifying crimes to make the numbers look better, he wants to waste TBI resources to act as Big Brother to our police department based on rumors and hearsay.


– Rep. Jesse Chism, D-Memphis


The same day, or thereabouts, though, Republican state Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County and GOP Rep. John Gillespie of Memphis asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to audit Memphis’ crime report for accuracy. It marked another Taylor bomb lobbed at Memphis after he worked this year for a state takeover of the city’s school district, saying – without providing proof – an audit could lead to criminal charges. 
Now comes Democratic Rep. Jesse Chism of Memphis calling their request “ridiculous.” 
“Sen. Taylor reportedly says in an interview that even though he hasn’t ‘seen any evidence’ that MPD is reclassifying crimes to make the numbers look better, he wants to waste TBI resources to act as Big Brother to our police department based on rumors and hearsay,” Chism said in a statement.
The normally soft-spoken Chism acknowledged more work is necessary to cull crime, but added, “We don’t need people casting doubt on the work being done by the dedicated men and women of the MPD, just like we don’t need an armed occupation by the National Guard.”
The governor’s stance last week put him at odds, somewhat, with President Donald Trump, who illegally – according to one court – unleashed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines in Los Angeles during protests over his deportation policy, which is putting a dent in the nation’s workforce.
Tennessee National Guard to join D.C. police order

Next week, Lee could have a different outlook, depending on how shrill the cry is to deploy.
Lee had no trouble sending Tennessee Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to patrol the streets at Trump’s request. If he sends troops into Memphis and Nashville, where will they go? What will they do? Will that be a sign that seven years of his policies failed?
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who rarely disagrees with Trump, except when it came to certifying Joe Biden’s presidential election five years ago, chimed in to agree with the president about occupying Memphis.
This elicited a response from Memphis City Council member Jerri Green, who thinks it’s a terrible idea and believes officials should focus on education and poverty. She’s running as a Democrat for governor and toured craft beer joints across the state to kick off her campaign, a great idea.
Can we get more pale ales, please?
Another Democrat ogles a congressional seat
Capping a couple of months of rumors, Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder kicked off his race for the Democratic nomination in Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District at an ice cream joint on the Columbia square Thursday. 
Molder, a Columbia native and attorney, is in his second term in office and has his sights set on the incumbent congressman, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles.

“People are tired of electing the most extreme voices on either side,” said Molder. “They’re looking for responsible leaders, whether Republican or Democrat, who aren’t just chasing the latest soundbite to grab a headline.”
“We don’t have to be embarrassed by our congressman,” he said, in an obvious reference to Ogles, who has had his share of ethical scrapes. 
Molder is the third Democrat to enter the primary, joining Metro Nashville Councilmember Mike Cortese and Jim Torino, the COO of a telemedicine business. But it’s no secret 5th District Democrats have been whispering in Molder’s ear for years, urging him to run. It won’t hurt that former House Democratic Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh, who is respected on both sides of the political aisle, is Molder’s father-in-law.
Taking it on the chin
Lee is appealing a Chancery Court decision declaring the state’s “intent to go armed” law and guns-in-parks prohibition unconstitutional, a move drawing heavy criticism from some House Republicans.
State Rep. Monty Fritts of Kingston penned letters to the governor and Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, blasted the decision in a Facebook post as “betrayal” and accusing the “elitist political class in Nashville” of spending tax dollars to take away “our Creator endowed rights.” WSMV reported it.
Besides complaints about the gun-law appeal, Fritts said the governor “created out of control budget growth,” up 59% in six years, and ignored lawmakers’ requests for immediate help after Hurricane Helene. Fritts also says “we cautioned him about placing us in the judgment path of God on the IVF/contraception bill which places babies at risk and he did not listen. But the Watchman must continue to call out the danger.”
(Never mind that a woman, Republican Rep. Iris Rudder of Winchester, sponsored the bill to make in vitro fertilization a right.) 
Sounding a bit like a gubernatorial candidate, Fritts wrote that the “Nashville establishment” doesn’t understand the concept of more liberty and less government (which is probably true). 

Shame on the Governor and Nashville establishment political machine for approving the continuing infringement upon Tennesseans 2A rights.

“I am already in the doghouse of a group of petty and weak bullies who cut backroom deals to kill my bills. I am certain my straight words here will not help that. But let the hard truth be heard,” Fritts says. “Pray for Tennessee. We are in trouble.” 
It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry. But it does sound sort of like the song that never ends.
“As the gutless, drunken, and dimwitted politicians smile at you and assert all is well, your money is being taken needlessly to fund corporate welfare and special interests, your rights are being eroded while crime in some cities explodes and we fund the education of illegals, you are told by senior leaders in Nashville that the church sign (which had been in place for 30 years) was in a right of way and they could do what they wished with it while you repair tires from potholes, and the people doing this to you feel no accountability to you.” 
OK, let me up, I’ve had enough.










That’s not freedom. That’s a recipe for disaster.


– Rep. London Lamar, D-Memphis, on allowing gun owners to carry weapons in parks


Asked why he appealed, Lee’s spokesperson Elizabeth Johnson said only that the governor appreciates the attorney general’s “leadership to defend Tennessee’s gun laws and provide clarity for law enforcement personnel and citizens.”
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis backed the decision to appeal, saying the laws exist to help police protect people.
“If the lower court’s ruling is allowed to stand, it will tie the hands of police officers – even when they encounter someone with a loaded assault rifle parked outside a children’s park,” she said.
Lamar accused Republican lawmakers of pandering to the gun lobby and dismantling the state’s gun-carry permit requirements (which would include Lee).
The senator added that officers wouldn’t be able to question a person’s intent for carrying an assault rifle “until it’s too late.”
“That’s not freedom. That’s a recipe for disaster,” she said.
The hits keep coming
The congressional House Freedom Fund endorsed state Rep. Jody Barrett in the 7th District special election set for Oct. 7 and is pouring a big chunk of cash into ads backing him for the post, the Tennessee Journal reports.
A Facebook post by the group says he’s the first elected official in the state to earn a 100% conservative rating on the Tennessee Legislative Report Card, a group backed by Williamson County-based Tennessee Stands and its leader, Senate candidate Gary Humble.
The House Freedom Fund, a political action committee
Barrett, a Dickson Republican, also signed Fritts’ letter to the attorney general questioning the gun-ruling appeal.
Also this week, Matt Van Epps, the state’s former General Services commissioner, got a lift from the Patriot Fund with an independent expenditure of nearly $28,500, according to the report.
On the Democratic front, state Rep. Gloria Johnson, one of the infamous “Tennessee Three,” endorsed Rep. Vincent Dixie in the 7th District race, saying she agrees with his focus on families.
This will be sure to win friends in the House Democratic Caucus, as two of Dixie’s colleagues — Reps. Aftyn Behn and Bo Mitchell of Nashville — are also running.
Head of the class?
Tennessee is leading the nation – again – with a bill requiring mass shooters to be tested for psychotropic and gender-altering drugs to see whether those might cause them to go on a violent spree such as the Covenant Schools shooting in Nashville.
The bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Rusty Crowe of Bristol and Rep. Mary Littleton of Dickson requires autopsy results on shooters to be sent to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center for studies on how the substances interact and whether they cause violent behavior.
“People often ask why these mass shootings were so rare decades ago,” Crowe said in a release. “We know the widespread use of powerful psychotropic drugs began around the same time we saw a rise in these horrific attacks, and it’s important to look into possible links. This law is about getting the data we need to protect our communities.”
Sounds almost like they’re trying to make transgender people the scapegoat for shootings. 
Then again, will they look for root causes in the legislature to inane bills and comments such as outlawing chemtrails, lynching people and encouraging first-cousin marriage?
“Alligator lizards in the air, in the air.”*

Credit: (Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)A New Orleans law aimed at boosting disaster planning at certain senior housing facilities has mixed results four years after the hurricane that prompted it.
 
This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Verite News and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.

Passed about two months after Hurricane Ida struck New Orleans in late August 2021, the law requires the dozens of independent living facilities in the city to obtain an annual license, develop emergency plans and coordinate disaster responses with city officials. During the extended citywide blackout after Ida, many of these facilities were abandoned by staff, forcing residents to fend for themselves in darkness and broiling heat. At least eight people died from excessive heat and other health issues at the city’s independent living facilities in the days after the storm.
Unlike nursing homes and assisted-living apartments, independent living facilities aren’t regulated by the state or required to have on-site staff or backup generators. Independent living facilities are generally more focused on socialization than on daily care or medical needs.
As of late last month, about a third of the 71 independent living facilities in New Orleans were still not in compliance with the law, according to city health department data. Sixteen of the  facilities that have yet to reach compliance submitted license applications that were approved, but no licenses were issued because the associated fees weren’t paid. Ten others submitted incomplete applications, according to the data, which was compiled by the department in late August.
It’s not a great compliance rate, but pretty good for New Orleans, which often takes a “wait-and-see attitude” toward disaster planning, said Howard Rodgers, executive director of the New Orleans Council on Aging, which provides social, educational and food services to the city’s elderly residents.
“It’s a step in the right direction,” he said. “But a lot of the responsibility for taking care of the seniors isn’t on the individuals running the independent living centers, it’s back on the seniors.”
After four years, anything less than 100% compliance is inexcusable, said Shirley Holmes, a senior housing resident whose husband died from health problems related to the post-Ida blackouts, which took 10 days to fix.
“They need to be held responsible and be in compliance,” she said. “Just telling somebody they need to do something isn’t enough. They’ll put it off as long as they can. It can take so long that it can be deadly.”

The health of Holmes’ husband, Walter, deteriorated after power was lost at the Oak Villa Apartments in Algiers, where they lived at the time. An inoperative elevator made it difficult for the couple to leave, and no staff were available to help them down the stairs from their second-floor apartment. Walter Holmes began rationing his oxygen and missed a scheduled medical treatment. As his breathing troubles worsened, an ambulance was called, but Walter couldn’t be revived at a hospital, where he was declared dead of heart failure.
The Oak Villa’s owner, real estate firm Latter & Blum, did not respond to requests for comment. The owners of several other independent living facilities either declined comment or did not respond. Shirley Holmes has since moved to a different apartment building.
Despite their more limited role with residents, independent living facilities should do more to plan and prepare for disasters, City Council members said in 2021.
“Many of the tenants were physically or financially unable to evacuate, and the owners and operators of the properties left them in inhumane conditions to fend for themselves,” then-Council member Kristin Gisleson Palmer said in 2021, shortly after the law was approved.

Facilities were slow to comply. In 2023, two years after the law was passed, most facilities were noncompliant. Last year, about a quarter of the facilities had not yet applied for licenses, according to the health department.
The threat of fines appears to have turned the tide somewhat, Rodgers said. In May 2024, the City Council approved new penalties for out-of-compliance facilities, including a $100-per-day fine during declared emergencies. The council also eased a requirement that facilities provide a list of all residents and on-site staff.
Last year, four fines were issued, according to the health department. Fines and related hearing costs totaled $1,350, with the largest single payment reaching $625. So far this year, a $1,000 fine with $125 for hearing costs was levied at a facility.
Rodgers said he would like to see the law strengthened, possibly with new requirements for backup generators and a mandated staff presence during disasters. He knows such measures would be costly for facilities, but he worries more lives will be lost when the next big storm comes.
“I know all that gets into profit margins,” he said. “But what we should be focused on is the best interests of our seniors.”

(Photo by Phillippe Gerber/Getty Images)The Keystone Exams were designed with two commendable goals: to establish a consistent statewide graduation standard and to serve as an accountability measure for high schools in preparing students for postsecondary success.
The exams were intended to become a graduation requirement by 2017.
Enacted in 2010, state legislation authorized the creation of ten end-of-course assessments; however, to date, only three Keystone Exams have been fully developed: Algebra I , Biology, and Literature.
The Keystone graduation requirement was indefinitely postponed in 2023, and students are now able to demonstrate their postsecondary preparedness and meet statewide requirements through one of five Pathways to Graduation. This has provided school districts with needed flexibility and recognizes diverse measures of achievement.
While the original intent of the Keystone Exams remains a commendable goal, it is increasingly clear they are no longer serving Pennsylvania students in a meaningful or equitable way. The time has come to reevaluate how we assess student readiness and school performance.
A careful evaluation of all our options for assessing student learning and performance is needed to make sure we are picking the right tools. That could mean ultimately moving to a widely recognized college entrance assessment such as the SAT or ACT. These exams focus on core reading and math competencies that are critical for both college and career readiness. Similar pathways have been successfully used by neighboring states for several years.
The SAT and ACT are already taken by thousands of Pennsylvania high school students and provide valuable feedback and opportunities for college admission. They also provide school districts with timely and actionable data.
This transition also presents a fiscally responsible path forward. Utilizing a single, nationally normed college entrance exam, rather than spending additional monies developing and maintaining the current Keystone, could reduce the burden on schools, free up valuable instructional time, and lessen the financial burden on families — many of whom currently pay out-of-pocket for these exams.
In the Pennsbury School District, we have successfully administered the PSAT and Pre-ACT during the regular school day for several years. Expanding this approach to include the SAT and PSAT would be a seamless transition. Shifting to these assessments would help streamline our overall testing strategy, minimize duplicative exams, reduce assessment-related stress for students, and likely reclaim valuable instructional time currently devoted to Keystone administration.
Most importantly, it would broaden access to college pathways for all students by integrating meaningful, nationally recognized assessments into the school experience.
It’s time to move away from the Keystone Exams and adopt an assessment system that better reflects the needs, aspirations, and realities of today’s students.

This story discusses suicide.  If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please call or text the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
Even though callers have lost access to a line dedicated to support the LGBTQ+ community, the director of a 988 crisis line in Kentucky says “help is still there.”
Geneva Robinson, director of the Crisis and Information Center for Seven Counties Services, told the Louisville Metro Board of Health on Wednesday that the loss of the LBGTQ+ option “doesn’t mean that services aren’t there.” 
Until recently callers to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline could press 3 to be connected with staff specially trained to help LGBTQ+ callers who are negotiating mental health issues, KFF Health News reports. But the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced this summer that the dedicated line was being eliminated. 
A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget told NBC News that the administration would no longer “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.” 
The Trevor Project reports the LGBTQ+community is at heightened risk of depression, with 45% of LGBTQ+ youth having seriously contemplated ending their lives at the time they were surveyed by the organization. 
Meet some of the Kentuckians answering 988

In Louisville, Robinson said 988 staff are trained to respond to concerns from all callers.
“All of our people who provide the services have specialized training, not only in crisis intervention generalist techniques, but cultural competency training and specific training to work with groups like those who present with issues related to LGBTQ areas,” she said. “So, people can still get that help that they need. They just don’t have, unfortunately, that dedicated line any longer to reach that help. But the help is still there.” 
The 988 system, launched by the federal government in 2022,  is a national network of more than 200 crisis centers that field calls, texts and chats. 
Seven Counties Services answered nearly 13,000 calls to the 988 line in the 2024-2025 fiscal year, Robinson said. In addition to Jefferson County, the agency serves Bullitt, Henry, Jefferson, Oldham, Shelby, Spencer  and Trimble counties. 
About 9,000 of those calls —70% — were from Louisville. That’s an average of about 173 local calls a week to the 988 line, which launched in July 2022, replacing a 10-digit number. The number is a mental health version of 911.
Other at-risk communities should feel safe to call when they need help and know that they’ll receive it confidentially, Robinson said. 
“There are a lot of folks in our community, particularly those who who are traditionally in disadvantaged groups or disenfranchised groups, who may not feel comfortable reaching out for help, who, for a lot of different reasons, may feel that they can’t trust calling into any line or going anywhere to receive services,” Robinson said. 
She referred specifically to undocumented immigrants, who have been the target of crackdowns from the Trump administration. 
“I’m thinking about a lot of folks who might be in this country undocumented, or might have family members or friends who are undocumented, and right now they’re very concerned that if they reach out for help — even medical help they might need — that it might result in deportation, it might result in being arrested, being taken away from their family, or having a family member taken away,” Robinson said. 
But, she stressed that 988 calls are confidential and anonymous. The only time a 988 operator would check caller identification is in the case of an imminent risk to life, Robinson said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado is one of the healthiest states in the country, but health isn’t determined by lifestyle choices alone. Our well-being is deeply influenced by the air we breathe, the water we drink and the environment we live in.
Too many Coloradans suffer the health impacts of pollution that are outside their control, especially children with asthma, seniors with respiratory issues and low-income communities near highways and industrial polluters. Despite this reality, U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans voted for a federal spending bill that cuts critical investments proven to reduce pollution and protect public health.
As a physician, I see these impacts up close in my patients every day. Poor air quality affects my patients even before they are born, impacting fetal lung development and resulting in an increase in premature births. When air quality is poor, I know that there will be more children in my clinic struggling to breathe from asthma. And despite living in beautiful Colorado, I have to tell kids it is not safe to play outside. We have a responsibility, as a community and a state, to make choices that create a clean and healthy environment for everyone.

The science is clear: The dirty fossil fuels we burn release pollutants and greenhouse gases that are endangering our health, especially in frontline communities living along highway corridors and around oil and gas operations, refineries and other polluting industries. According to the American Lung Association’s State of the Air report, 80% of Coloradans live in communities with unhealthy air.
Air pollution is one of the most dangerous threats to public health, more than high blood pressure, smoking or diabetes. It’s strongly linked to heart attacks, strokes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and even dementia.
Over the past 20 years, Colorado has led the way in reducing emissions and cleaning up our air. We’ve closed coal plants, expanded wind and solar energy, regulated methane emissions and been among the top states in the adoption of electric vehicles. We’ve installed electric vehicle chargers, bought electric school buses and strengthened building efficiency standards. These steps aren’t just good for the planet — they’re good for our lungs, our hearts and our families.
Until January, we had a strong partner in the federal government, and Colorado received hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy and climate-related projects from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Now, Congress has passed a spending bill that not only eliminates the clean energy investments protecting our health, but takes away health care from the communities most impacted by higher levels of pollution. Evans helped make that happen. He had the chance to stand up for his constituents’ health; instead, he voted for legislation that puts Colorado communities at greater risk of pollution, illness and economic instability.
This summer, as ozone season worsens and more Coloradans are warned to stay inside, it’s important to remember that by cleaning up our air and cutting pollution, we make our communities healthier. One study predicted that national IRA investments in greenhouse gas reduction could, by 2050, prevent nearly 1 million asthma attacks, 41,000 heart attacks and 19,000 hospital admissions — a total of more than 3 million lost workdays and 33,000 deaths. Those are real lives saved by the kind of clean energy policies Evans just voted to dismantle.
Every Coloradan will benefit from cleaner, healthier energy. But let’s especially remember those disproportionately affected: children, pregnant individuals, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, communities of color, people in historically redlined neighborhoods, and communities near highways, power plants or industrial facilities. No matter the individual health choices they make, they bear the burden, or will reap the benefits, of the choices we make together.
Clean energy is preventive medicine. Let’s prescribe more of it — and demand that our leaders prioritize it, too.

Rising grocery prices leave families in Louisville and Lancaster alike […]","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell administers the oath of office to Lisa Cook to serve as a member of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve System during a ceremony at the William McChesney Martin Jr. Building of the Federal Reserve May 23, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)For many Kentuckians, the American dream feels harder to reach than ever. Homeownership, once a reasonable goal for young families in Bowling Green or Lexington, now feels like a fantasy. Farmers in Western Kentucky see the cost of new equipment loans edging out of reach. Rising grocery prices leave families in Louisville and Lancaster alike wondering how much further their paychecks can stretch.
Kentuckians may not see the inner maneuverings of Washington every day, but when political leaders bend economic levers to reward allies or punish critics, it is our wallets, our homes and our farms that will feel the impact first.
Friedrich Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist whose “The Road to Serfdom” remains a libertarian benchmark, warned nearly 80 years ago about exactly this danger: When political leaders turn economic life into a tool of power, ordinary citizens pay the price. The point of his book was not simply about socialism, as it is often miscast, but about the concentration of power where calculating and capricious rulers bend economic institutions to their own ends.
That is what we are seeing today. President Donald Trump’s attempted firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has little to do with mortgage paperwork and everything to do with Trump’s ongoing campaign to weaponize the federal government against anyone deemed insufficiently loyal.
In this case, it happens to be the first Black woman to serve in one of the most powerful economic institutions in the world. 
Should Kentuckians care? Absolutely. Because when the independence of the Federal Reserve is compromised, it’s not Wall Street bankers who suffer first; the first to suffer are the families at the local Kroger, the borrowers at the local credit union and the farmers depending on affordable credit to plant next year’s crop.
The authoritarian playbook
This is not an isolated event. Sen. Adam Schiff, Attorney General Letitia James, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and national security adviser John Bolton have all faced Trump’s ire for the same reason: they dared to dissent. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman recently summed up the lesson of these attacks succinctly: “If you get in our way, we will ruin your lives.”
Hayek, who witnessed authoritarian regimes consolidate power in pre-WWII Europe before immigrating to England and then the United States, would instantly recognize the pattern. Authoritarians don’t necessarily just jail their opponents in remote prisons using secret police; they make professional life, business opportunity and financial security contingent on political loyalty. They turn independent institutions like the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission into instruments of fear.  And fear, once entrenched, corrodes faith in the institutional independence of these vital institutions that help sustain both democracy and prosperity.

Why the Federal Reserve matters to Kentucky
The Federal Reserve is not some distant, abstract body. It sets interest rates that shape mortgage costs in Pikeville, farm loans in Murray and small business credit in Louisa. It regulates banks throughout our commonwealth and works to keep the financial system sound. If its independence collapses under political pressure, Kentuckians will feel the impact long before anyone on Wall Street.
Trump has already said he wants interest rates kept low to bolster the stock market. If Fed governors fear that defying him could lead to public smears, firings or investigations, they won’t act on sound judgment — they’ll act out of fear. That turns monetary policy from a tool of stability into a tool of political convenience. 
Look no further than Turkey under Erdoğan or Venezuela under Maduro today for examples of economic chaos following politicians who strong-armed central banks. Imagine banks judged not by their solvency but by their willingness to please the White House. Imagine monetary policy dictated not by data but by fear of retribution. That’s not free enterprise. That is Hayek’s warning realized: a road to serfdom paved with crony capitalism and authoritarian intimidation.
Freedom through fear is no freedom
We should be clear about what’s at stake. This is not just about Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve or any other independent institutions on the president’s “nasty list:” It’s about whether ordinary Kentuckians can rely on a financial system that operates fairly and independently, or whether mortgages, loans and credit become rewards or punishments in the hands of political leaders. 
If political power can reach into your mortgage application, your student loans, your tax filings or your professional record to punish you for speaking your mind, then freedom becomes a front, nothing but a weak façade to mask authoritarianism. This is how authoritarianism works — not always with gulags and barbed wire, but with threats, ruined reputations and the constant fear of being next.

Hayek ended “The Road to Serfdom” with a plea: Resist the temptation to let leaders amass unchecked power over economic life.
That plea is ours to hear again. The independence of the Federal Reserve may seem like an abstract battle in Washington, but it directly affects the mortgages Kentuckians pay, the farm loans that keep fields planted and the small-business credit that keeps Main Street stores across Kentucky open. Protecting that independence is nothing less than protecting the economic freedom of every family and entrepreneur in the commonwealth.

If Trump succeeds in strongly bending the Fed to his will, Kentuckians should expect not prosperity but instability with an economy ruled by favoritism, fear, and the hollow promise that what serves the loyal and the powerful will somehow trickle down to the rest of us.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)On Friday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, otherwise known as the Fairwinds Landing renovation project in Virginia’s Hampton Roads region, would have its over $39 million in federal funding withdrawn. Work has already begun on that project. He also announced the termination of $20 million for the Portsmouth Marine Terminal (PMT) Offshore Wind Development Project, which has already been spent.
“Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Duffy said in the announcement. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry.” 
It is not clear how much of that funding for the Fairwinds Landing project has been spent already and how much would have to be returned to the federal government. A representative for the Norfolk Economic Development Authority said they have supported the effort to request for reconsideration on the cut. They also said the project will positively support the local economy and the U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding needs.
“Our revised project scope of work, which was submitted to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) in mid-August in response to their request, will help restore America’s maritime dominance by focusing on rebuilding America’s shipbuilding and maritime industrial base in line with MARAD’s current priorities. We look forward to working with MARAD to utilize the (Port Infrastructure Development Program) funds at Fairwinds to address critical port upgrades that support its goals,” Mia Byrd Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Norfolk Department of Economic Development said.
The PMT project was billed as an effort to upgrade the terminal to be a staging area for offshore wind infrastructure buildouts, such as the nearly $11 billion Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project that is over halfway completed. The overall PMT project cost $223 million and was completed in March. The federal funds had been awarded in 2022.
“The Port of Virginia has completed the improvements made to Portsmouth Marine Terminal and as a result, the deep-water terminal is fully-functional, ” Port of Virginia spokesman Joseph Harris said. “The federal government’s Port Infrastructure Development Program grant was integral to the success of this project because funds from that program helped offset some of the improvement costs. The PMT project was delivered on-time and on-budget, thus this port has no unobligated federal funds.”
The Dominion project did not have any federal grants, John Larson with Dominion said in the meeting. With the PMT renovations already finished to allow for the staging of pylons for the wind turbines, the project should continue as planned. The 2.6 gigawatt offshore wind project is anticipated to come online in 2026.
“You know, we’re continuing to move forward and focus on the project,” Larson said. “If you look at the president’s comments, he stated that, you know, companies that were doing well with their projects, that were far along, they’re going to take hard reviews. What does that mean?”
At a September 3 meeting, the Virginia Offshore Wind Authority discussed continuing to promote offshore wind projects, despite their newfound unpopularity on the federal level. With Virginia facing an energy crisis, the board said that an “all of the above” approach needs to include offshore wind as part of the puzzle of addressing the state’s needs.
“The political reality is that we need all of them because based on who’s in office, energy projects change. Right now, SMRs and gas are popular, who knows? Next year, it can be back to renewables. We need to be developing all of it,” Virginia Maritime Association Senior Vice President Will Fediw said in the meeting.
Virginia’s federal lawmakers are also weighing in. Democratic Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, along with U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said the efforts to withdraw funds from the Norfolk project are reckless and impact more than just offshore wind projects, as the funds for the port would have improved the port overall, including for shipbuilding, an industry critical to the nation’s economic and defense sectors.
“If the Administration took the time to learn about the project, it would realize that it is about investing in maritime supply chains and port infrastructure to support not only clean energy but also shipbuilding and ship repair. Stopping this project makes no sense, hurts our economy, and is completely counterproductive to the Administration’s so-called efforts to ‘restore America’s maritime dominance,’” the delegation said in a joint statement. “We will be working with our colleagues in Congress, state officials, and partners in the region to urge the Trump Administration to reverse its decision.”

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. 
 Hundreds of red flag orders used in Hampton Roads

A Virginia law that allows law enforcement to temporarily take someone’s guns if there is evidence that they could hurt themselves or others was used at least 379 times in the Hampton Roads region over the past five years, a local television station’s FOIA requests revealed in late August.
In 2020, Virginia passed the law, known as the red flag law or the Substantial Risk Order law, in an effort to address gun violence. At the time, Democrats controlled the General Assembly and held the governor’s mansion.
According to the records request made by 13News Now, the city of Hampton had the highest number of orders per person, at 169. 
Virginia Beach followed with 58 orders, and Chesapeake and Newport News each had 35. 13News also learned that in York County, 25 red flag orders have been issued since 2020. 
Further investigation by the station found that the measure’s intervention “may not guarantee a peaceful resolution in the end.”
In 2024, Dana Plummer kidnapped his three children from their Virginia Beach home after stabbing their mother, before leading police on a cross-state chase. Records revealed that Plummer surrendered several weapons, including a shotgun, to Virginia Beach police under a red flag order before the abduction.
Officers assessed that Plummer “seemed to be going through a crisis” and a judge later found that he was not “mentally fit” to stand trial.



The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings. 


 Court denies attorney fees in Augusta County closed meeting case

The Virginia Court of Appeals denied $20,000 in attorney fees to Breaking Through Media LLC, which attempted to obtain a secret recording from a county Board of Supervisors’ closed session.
Closed meetings are generally not recorded because they are exempt from the state’s open meeting requirements. The recording was allegedly made by one of the supervisors. 
According to a report by the News Leader, Breaking Through Media LLC and Samuel Orlando sued Augusta County to obtain the March 20, 2023 recording, arguing that the locality violated the state’s open meeting law.
Ultimately, the board successfully appealed to keep the records sealed because the court found that releasing them could violate the privacy of a county employee.
However, in an appeal to collect $21,632.45 in attorney fees, the appeals court upheld the August County Circuit Court’s decision in denying the attorney fees. Records show the circuit court denied the request because Breaking Through failed to prove the fees were fair and they didn’t win enough in their case.
“This court finds that the main object of appellants’ petition was to obtain documents requested under VFOIA that they believed the county wrongfully withheld,” reads the opinion written by Judge Vernida R. Chaney on Aug. 26. “Because appellants failed to obtain this recording, they did not obtain the object of their suit. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellants were not entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs.”
News Leader reported that Breaking Through has not posted anything on Facebook since June 1, and links on its posts no longer link to an active website. Breaking Through’s last video report was uploaded to the site’s YouTube page three months ago.
 Governor hopeful cites ‘working papers’ to rebuff schedule request

The office of Virginia’s Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears, the Republican nominee for governor, has withheld several records as “working papers,” according to a recent investigation by VPM News.
The finding comes after the media outlet asked Sears about her role in Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, and made a records request for her schedule — a record that is required by law to be maintained and permanently held. Public scrutiny of Earle-Sears has mounted since she became the nominee to succeed Youngkin against her opponent, former Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger.
“I’m not going to divulge what we talk about. But remember that I’m a former legislator as well, and I understand the legislative process,” Sears said to VPM, as reported August 20. “We’ve talked about some things, and I’m just going to leave it at that. I’ve given him advice on certain things … we just have things that we’ve discussed on how to move certain things and how certain things will move.”
In response to the schedule request, the office produced a “largely-blank, 297-page PDF” that excluded records, citing the exemption covering “confidential correspondence and working papers of the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.” The released documents also did not include events that Earle-Sears’ office had previously released to the public.
VPM filed another request, clarifying and broadening the original request, but reported that the office did not respond within the required time period under Virginia law — an initial five business days, with the option to invoke a seven-day extension, which Earle-Sears’ office did, according to VPM.
The office reiterated its earlier response to VPM, and noted that it does not maintain records for Earle-Sears’ roles as president of the state Senate or on boards and commissions.
“We remain committed to transparency and accountability in government, but must also adhere to statutory provisions in place to safeguard information of a sensitive nature,” the office wrote in the response.
 Richmond tells WTVR free report would cost $700

The city of Richmond told WTVR a redacted copy of the consultant report on the aftermath of the city’s May boil advisory would cost $700. Instead, WTVR acquired the same report at no cost from the Virginia Department of Health.
State law allows government agencies to make reasonable charges for searching and supplying public records, or to waive those charges. WTVR faced a charge $87 to $93 per hour for senior public utility leaders to review the records and “cross-reference best practice regulations and homeland security requirements to determine appropriate redactions,” the TV station reported.
WTVR made the request after widespread attention and concerns about the city’s water treatment plant, which serves the city and its neighboring counties. The May water advisory follows the water crisis in January, which left residents without drinking water for days and delayed the return of the General Assembly, and a fluoride exceedance in April.
When asked whether $700 was a reasonable charge to provide an 18-page report, spokesperson Rhonda Johnson from the city’s Department of Public Utilities (DPU) told the station “the $700 value provided was estimated based on the time required to complete this request by the city at the time of the request.”
The report found that while data supported DPU’s coagulation process as effective, there were several ways in which it could be improved, according to WTVR. The coagulation process removes ​​suspended impurities from water.
WTVR said the report noted that “current procedures for operating the filters during normal flow and backwash are not optimized provide for increased filter efficiency or operational flexibility in response to adverse water quality conditions” and that “coagulation control at the [plant] has the ability to be improved upon through” enhanced water treatment and monitoring.
The report stated the city should implement more testing and sampling to determine the optimal coagulant dosing. It also recommended providing “additional operational oversight leading up to and during events that have the potential to lead to adverse raw water quality conditions.”
WTVR said it requested an interview with a DPU leader, but no one was available.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohioans could soon be able to sign up for programs that reduce their energy bills in exchange for allowing the utility to dial back their consumption. These demand response programs already exist for big energy consumers like factories, but state Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, thinks residential consumers should have the opportunity as well.
“This is one more tool in the toolbox that gives the distribution folks, the ability to manage the power so those that need it the most — and you can put whatever you want in there — that they are never without power,” he said.
In a press release describing the measure, House Bill 427, Klopfenstein offers a few examples. Utilities might roll back your smart thermostat on a really hot day, or cycle home appliances like your water heater.
Klopfenstein’s measure doesn’t specify the exact terms of a program. Instead, it directs state regulators to consider proposals from utilities so long as the programs are voluntary and open to everyone. It also requires that customers can override the power reductions. The Public Utility Commission of Ohio gets tasked with weighing whether programs are cost-effective for consumers and offer long-term savings to the energy grid.

Many states offer demand response programs for residential customers, with varying incentive or rebate structures. In California, for instance, PG&E’s Power Saver Rewards Program notifies customers that demand is high and then gives them a dollar per kWh of power they save.
“My rural cooperative has had a radio control on my electric hot water heater probably for 40 years,” Klopfenstein said. “This gives them the ability to shut the hot water heater off to limit demand during peak times. And in 40 years, I have never recognized when it was shut off.”
Although he got paid up-front to participate, Klopfenstein said he doesn’t get a monthly incentive on his bill. Because he gets power through a co-op, though, he said the better they manage demand the lower his bills are overall.
“Now, I will tell you what I believe consumers will want today, they’re going to want to be rewarded probably more than I am — and that’s OK.” Klopfenstein said. “Somewhere in there there’s a balance, but we need to give them a tool to manage the power distribution.”
Supply and demand
Klopfenstein sponsored a sweeping energy measure known as House Bill 15 earlier this year. That measure aimed to encourage new energy generation by offering tax incentives to new facilities and streamlining the regulatory process. The bill also ended a controversial coal plant bailout tied to the House Bill 6 scandal.
Notably, that bill got broad bipartisan support and Rob Kelter, managing attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center, sees Klopfenstein’s newest proposal as a continuation.
“Good energy policy manages both supply and demand. Ohio lawmakers took measures in HB 15 to increase supply, and we commend Rep. Klopfenstein and Chair (Rep. Adam) Holmes for moving quickly to lower demand,” Kelter said. “Republicans and Democrats worked together on HB 15, and we know there will be similar cooperation here.”
In a press release, the Environmental Law & Policy Center estimates residential demand response could “create estimated net savings of between $34.5 million and $104 million for the utility system, depending on participation rate.” The group added that companies can roll out programs to reduce demand far faster than they can increase supply by standing up new power plants — even with HB 15 greasing the skids.
Klopfenstein explained residential demand response almost made it into HB 15 itself. But it showed up as an amendment late in the process, and lawmakers stripped it out so they could debate it further.
Still, the idea appears to have supporters on both sides of the aisle. Nolan Rutschilling from the Ohio Environmental Council said demand response is “crucial to addressing skyrocketing energy costs.”
“This legislation allows utilities and retail energy providers to establish programs that save customers money, reduce strain on our electric grid, and create more capacity in the PJM market, lessening the burden on all energy customers,” he added.
Ohio Conservative Energy Forum Executive Director Shayna Fritz said, “providing demand response solutions will ensure we are helping our energy remain reliable during peak times. We worked with Ohio lawmakers on critical energy legislation such as House Bill 15 and look forward to working with them again to develop the best solutions for all residents.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending law will likely force more than half the states to reduce payments to doctors and hospitals that treat Medicaid patients, a change critics warn will be particularly harmful to rural hospitals struggling to stay afloat.
Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for low-income people, reimburses doctors, hospitals and nursing facilities for treating enrollees. But in many cases, the program doesn’t fully cover the cost of care, straining providers that serve a large share of Medicaid patients.
To help providers cover losses and continue to serve poorer populations, the federal government allows the 41 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have contracted with Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) to run their Medicaid programs to direct them to pay providers more — in some cases, as much as commercial plans
Ultimately, taxpayers cover the costs of these so-called state directed payments — and those costs are growing. As of August 2024, the higher payments were projected to add $110.2 billion per year to Medicaid spending, nearly 60% more than the previous year’s projection.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

That higher spending attracted the attention of conservatives on Capitol Hill.
Beginning in 2028, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cap the payments, forcing state Medicaid programs to reduce reimbursement rates by 10 percentage points each year until they reach either 100% or 110% of what Medicare pays. States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would be capped at the lower rate.
The new law will reduce Medicaid spending by $149 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and reduce Medicaid provider payments in as many as 31 states, according to KFF, a health policy research group. A separate analysis by The Commonwealth Fund, another research group, found that Medicaid payments to hospitals would drop by at least 20% in 19 of the 25 states that had publicly available data.
Critics say the change could be disastrous for hospitals, many of them in rural areas, that see a large share of Medicaid patients.
“This is all on top of an already pretty strained financial situation for rural hospitals,” Alexa McKinley Abel, director of government affairs and policy at the National Rural Health Association, a group representing rural health care providers, said in an interview. “We are worried about seeing service line closures at hospitals in an environment where OB-GYN and chemotherapy service lines are already being cut.”
Covering the cost of care
Supporters of the change say the extra payments inflate federal spending on the Medicaid program, giving hospitals “windfall profits.”
“Not only do these programs sidestep the truly needy on Medicaid and favor special interests instead, but all this is financed by growing the federal debt, leading to inflation and higher interest rates for all Americans,” the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank that helped draft the bill, stated in a policy brief.
Hospital leaders dispute that. Earlier this year, the American Hospital Association asserted that without the extra payments, Medicaid managed care organizations in 2023 only covered about two-thirds of the actual cost of care.
GOP senators warn mega-bill’s new Medicaid cuts will hurt rural hospitals

Cindy Samuelson, senior vice president of the Kansas Hospital Association, said the additional payments are especially critical in a rural state such as Kansas, where some researchers have found that 87% of rural hospitals are in the red. Kansas is one of 10 states that did not expand Medicaid, and like other nonexpansion states, it will have to begin reducing direct payments to 110% of what Medicare pays starting in 2028.
“Over time, commercial payers are paying less and less,” Samuelson said. “Many hospitals in our state are at risk of closure.”
Samuelson said that in rural areas, health care providers see fewer patients, which makes it hard to spread out the cost of care and make up for losses that come from serving underinsured, Medicaid and Medicare patients. One result is that rural hospitals are trimming services. A report published this year by Chartis, a health care consulting firm, found that between 2011 and 2023, nearly 300 rural hospitals across the country stopped offering obstetrics care, and 424 rural hospitals ceased chemotherapy services.
In Hutchinson, Kansas, Benjamin Anderson, CEO of the rural and community-owned Hutchinson Regional Health System, said his hospital barely broke even this year, and lower Medicaid payments will take a toll. The 190-bed hospital serves more than 65,000 people in the central Kansas region, and sees a lot of patients who are struggling with mental health issues and substance use disorders.










When we think about the cuts to Medicaid, it isn't simply about cutting services to the poor. It's threatening services to everyone.


– Benjamin Anderson, CEO of Hutchinson Regional Health System


“We are closely managing our workforce expenses. We’re going to be relying more heavily on philanthropy,” Anderson said, adding that the hospital wouldn’t lay off staff but would reduce the number of workers by not filling open positions.
He said his hospital has some cash reserves that should enable it to keep going, but that many other rural hospitals lack such a cushion.
“When we think about the cuts to Medicaid, it isn’t simply about cutting services to the poor. It’s threatening services to everyone, because in a rural community, we all get care in the same place,” he said. “If we cut out the safety net that’s sustaining these hospitals, everyone’s health care is threatened.”
Searching for answers
Three hours northeast of Hutchinson is the rural town of Holton, where about 3,400 people live. Holton Community Hospital is a 14-bed critical access hospital, meaning that it provides emergency care around the clock for a rural community. For the past two years, it has been struggling, according to Carrie Lutz, the hospital’s CEO.
Lutz said the hospital is not part of a broader health care group, and it relies on philanthropy and local taxes. Due to financial strains, it’s in the process of selling off its home and hospice services to another health care facility. The cap on extra payments will be an additional barrier, she said.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

Samuelson said Kansas is applying for money under the five-year, $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, which Congress added to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act amid concerns about its impact on rural hospitals. She expects Kansas to get at least $500 million between 2026 and 2030.
Rural hospitals in Mississippi also hope to tap into those funds. The Mississippi Hospital Association, which is advising state leaders on their application, said it expects Mississippi to get at least $500 million over the next five years.
Like Kansas, Mississippi did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care, a decision that deprived it of additional Medicaid patients and thus extra revenue.
“A few years ago, we had several rural hospitals that were facing some imminent closure challenges, and so our enhanced supplemental payment based on the average commercial rate has been a lifeline,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“What we’re concerned about is that when those payments start to decrease, then we’re going to be right back to where we were in 2022, with concerns about rural hospitals again.”
Roberson said Medicaid, with the additional payments, had become “one of the best payers, if not the best payer, for our hospitals over the last two years,” and helped a lot of hospitals stay out of the red.
He said the new rural health care fund is promising, but noted that Mississippi will decide where to spend any money it gets, and some rural hospitals might miss out.
“We want to make sure we’re working with the state to provide sustainable solutions, not one-time fixes,” Roberson said. “The big wild card is the Rural Health Transformation fund and what the state chooses to do with that money.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine isn’t considering sending National Guard troops to Chicago amid the Trump administration’s newest plan to mobilize the military — but that could change once he gets the request, his team said.
In a recent press conference, President Donald Trump told reporters that Chicago was a “hellhole.”
“Well, we’re going in,” Trump said. “I didn’t say when we’re going in.”
At least eight people were killed and 58 others were injured in shootings over Labor Day weekend, Chicago police said. The violence is the reason why Trump, despite already threatening to come to the city, made his decision.
“Look, I have an obligation,” he said. “This isn’t a political thing.”
Currently, more than 150 National Guard members from Ohio have been mobilized in Washington, D.C. for nearly two weeks.
“Their work has been, continues to be, guarding federal buildings and doing some patrols,” DeWine said.


The Trump administration asked DeWine to deploy the troops, with Vice President JD Vance saying they will help reduce crime.
“The national capital of the most powerful nation in the history of the world had a murder every other day, carjackings, armed robberies that rival literal third-world countries,” Vance said at an event.
Violent crime is at a 30-year low, according to D.C. police. Recently, troops have been spotted cleaning up garbage and doing landscaping.
“To see those folks walking around with big trash bags on the National Mall, it’s just not the best use of those folks, and frankly, not the best use of taxpayer money,” veteran and lawyer Adam Miller said.
A Joint Task Force–District of Columbia spokesperson said Ohio troops haven’t been on trash patrol, though.
Miller rallied with about 30 other protestors when the troops first got to D.C., arguing to bring them home.
“Cancel this ill-considered, legally problematic and unwarranted mission,” he said.
And a federal judge agreed — at least for Trump’s deployment in Los Angeles. A California judge ruled that the president illegally sent troops in June to quell immigration protests, since federal law states that the military can’t be used for “domestic law enforcement” under the Posse Comitatus Act.
The judge ruled that Trump must stop using the military “to execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation or acting as informants” unless it meets the federal threshold.
“‘Does the mission in front of us meet the requirements of federal law and the state law that implements that law in our federal system?’ And if it doesn’t, then we don’t send our troops,” Miller said.


Trump’s team dismissed the ruling, and the president said that he actually helped California in curbing the anti-ICE protests.
DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney said that this ruling doesn’t have the same application in D.C., since Trump has more authority in the capital.
Tierney said they could not consider sending troops to other cities without seeing an order, and thus, aren’t considering it yet.
However, DeWine has repeatedly said that he approved the D.C. request because he tends to accept every ask, like he has done in the past for both Republican and Democratic leaders of other states during natural disasters or from mayors when there is civil unrest in Ohio cities.
“My decision to send the National Guard to Washington, D.C. is the same reason that I did to Columbus — made that available when the Columbus mayor wanted the guard — the same way with Cleveland,” the governor said.
The DC deployment will last 30 days, but the governor’s team said if Trump asks, he will extend.

Hundreds of business people, policy analysts, and conservative advocates filled a downtown Cleveland conference hall last week for the National Conservative Energy Summit. One major theme: the need for both the federal and local governments to remove increasingly high hurdles to building renewable energy.


“Conservatives can and should lead on energy,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, in his opening remarks.


The group, which cohosted the program with the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum, has a mission ​“to champion secure, reliable, affordable, clean American energy.” Its goal of achieving American energy independence includes support for a range of technologies, including solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, biomass, and small modular nuclear reactors.


The Trump administration has taken a more single-minded approach to energy.


Since January, it has promoted more fossil-fuel use and stalled the retirement of aging power plants. At the same time, it has rescinded grants and loans for clean energy projects; eliminated tax credits for wind, solar, EVs, and home-energy upgrades; and even halted construction on some offshore wind projects.


“While it’s easy to view this as a roadblock, … it’s a signal that we have more work to do,” Szoka said. He encouraged attendees to use what they learned during the conference in their grassroots efforts to build support for clean energy, especially when faced with extremism and misinformation. ​“If we don’t explain what’s going on clearly, we risk losing the argument before it even starts.”


As President Donald Trump attacks clean energy at the federal level, some states like Colorado and Maine are pushing to speed up deployment. But in general, state and local laws that restrict renewable energy development are gaining steam nationwide. A June report by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University notes 16 states with laws limiting solar or wind, with over 450 counties and municipalities across more than 40 states imposing other restrictions.


Speaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio’s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30 counties in the state ban solar or wind energy in all or parts of their territories, an authority granted to them by a 2021 law known as Senate Bill 52. The board or its staff have also determined solar and wind projects are not in the public interest in several cases where bans didn’t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.


Asked for her advice to developers, French said, ​“I just think communicating with the local officials around the project is so helpful, and being part of that community and earning their trust is very effective.”


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCompanies often hear such suggestions, but ​“frankly, I think that’s used as a cop-out sometimes,” said Drew Christensen, senior director of public engagement at utility-scale developer Apex Clean Energy, during a later panel about how policies shape companies’ decisions.

No matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.


The deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.


Constraints on renewables also tread on landowners’ property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.


“What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?” Stallings said. The point resonated with various attendees from state chapters of the Land and Liberty Coalition, who made comments during networking breaks that property owners should be free to make their own economic decisions about their land.


Meanwhile, ​“this idea of behind-the-scenes picking winners and losers, that’s what’s going to create a reliability problem,” Stallings said. That risk is already visible: Late last month, the grid operator ISO New England warned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.


This past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy — both renewable and fossil-fueled — in large part because the law doesn’t pick winners, according to state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood. House Bill 15 passed with unanimous support in the Ohio Senate and just two dissenting Republican votes in the House.


Speaking on a panel about the new law, Rader called it a big step but emphasized that the state still has barriers to getting additional renewable energy on the grid.
“We don’t need to incentivize it. In Ohio, we just need a level playing field,” he said.


For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB 15 that would have created a community solar pilot program. Two Republicans in the House have introduced a separate bill to revive a version of that measure.


Beyond that, the law left SB 52’s extra hurdles for solar and wind in place, along with property line setbacks for wind that were tripled by a last-minute addition to a 2014 budget law.


“We have put up a lot of barriers to different forms of power over the years,” said state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, who noted that added levels of government review compound uncertainty for developers. ​“I think the solution is removing those barriers.”

Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka on May 18, 2024. (Cuyler Dunn for Kansas Reflector)A directive from the Trump administration has many worrying: What will happen during the next few weeks to the history on display at the five Kansas locations managed by the National Park Service?
The concern stems from a March executive order from President Donald Trump and a subsequent order from his director of the Interior, Doug Burgum. Brace yourself for vertigo if you read them both in one sitting. 
Trump and Burgum (or whoever wrote on their behalf) swirl legalese and political buzzwords into an Orwellian toxic stew: phrases like “any other measures” and “shall be implemented” mixed with “our extraordinary heritage” and “divisive narratives.”
The writing is half campaign press release, half authoritarian playbook — or perhaps I am being nostalgic by separating the two. 
In substance, the orders instruct federal workers to swiftly whitewash America’s past at its most significant historical locations. 
Most urgently, Burgum’s May 20 order requires park service employees to review properties for “inappropriate content” and potentially change “images, descriptions, depictions, messages, narratives or other information (content) that inappropriately disparages Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times).”
The bottom-line goal? To remove “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features” by Sept. 17. 
The National Park Service seems all tied in knots. Its website offers a very unTrumpian line: “Some history hurts and some heals, but all of it can surprise and inspire us.”
A group of university librarians and data researchers aims to preserve these National Park Service signs. Using a website called Save Our Signs, the five project leaders are asking for digital photos documenting each park’s exhibits and signage, including here in Kansas. 
Visitors to national preserves, parks and sites are sending images to the website to compile a history that the federal government might soon alter. 
Locations that have been photographed appear as green dots on the “Save Our Signs” map, contrasting the gray un-photographed locations. 
Here in Kansas, three of the five National Park Service locations have not yet been documented at all. We can change those gray dots to green before the history itself gets changed. 
Save Our Signs does not yet have images for: 

Fort Larned National Historical Site 
Nicodemus National Historical Site
Fort Scott National Historical Site

Visitors have already uploaded 35 images from the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka and one image from Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve.
Time is running out for Kansans to turn all five locations into green dots. 
Call it hobbyist photography. Call it political activism. Call it your chore for the resistances. Regardless, we Kansans can get this done. 
Molly Blake, one of the university librarians who created the national database of images, said in an interview that Save Our Signs will publish the submitted images on Oct. 13. They will first confirm the images’ authenticity and also ensure the privacy of people who appear in the images. 
“Our goal is to preserve all the signs as they are right now, so that we have a record of them, and so members of the general public can see these signs that were created by taxpayer money, created by civil servants in the National Park Service with the intention of helping the public understand the historical significance of these sites,” Blake said.
The people who maintain the Save Our Signs website aren’t saying the signs are perfect, Blake said. 
“We know they were created over a number of years, and people might take pictures of a sign that maybe they have a critique about or think it doesn’t tell the full history,” Blake said. “We’re not asking people to pass judgment on the signs. We invite them to think critically about the signs.”
The focus has been on signage because at least one exhibit, according to the New York Times, already has been altered in Muir Woods National Monument in California.
Consider the folly of presenting American history in the halcyon way that Trump and Burgum describe. 
It would be nice to have a country built exclusively on the “greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people,” as Burgum instructs. Trump’s executive order targets any content that might “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (…) and instead focuses on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”
Blake sees the absurdity in these orders, and I agree. 
“We all know that actual American history encompasses everything that happened and how all communities experienced it,” Blake said. “And people have the right to access that information. I think something that’s especially insidious about the secretarial order is that there’s obviously no shared definition of what it means to be disparaging.”
This MAGA historical naivete has been exposed, particularly here in Kansas, where our National Park Service sites are significant because — not in spite of — of their contentious histories.
Yes, President Trump, the Brown v. Board of Education park is an uplifting testament to the grit and courage of Kansas school children. 
But it also doesn’t exist without violent, white American racism that kept Black children out of certain schools. At the Brown v. Board of Education park, the Trump-inspired makeover would need to be more extreme than removing a few signs. How can you create a museum that is wholly “solemn and uplifting” when it documents how Black school children were required to fight for their right to an equal education — an injustice that defined American life for hundreds of years, starting in the colonies?
Yes, the Nicodemus settlement in Kansas documents the Christian faith of Americans searching for and finding their “Promised Land.” But it also stands as living proof of formerly enslaved Black people migrating north, away from the Jim Crow laws of the South. The community of Nicodemus doesn’t exist without racist hostility of Reconstruction following the Civil War. 
And yes, Fort Larned documents the lives of 19th century American soldiers. But our government built Fort Larned to manage escalating conflicts with Native American tribes that U.S. Army muskets displaced. As the National Park Service’s own website says (for the moment, at least), forts like Larned were “a place where Army troops in the area fighting Indians could get supplies and rest.”
This violent, racist and aggressive past is our history, as Americans and Kansans. Chasing down signs won’t change that.
Scrubbing these Kansas sites until they are squeaky clean would effectively erase them. And vanishing these American stories certainly seems like the administration’s goal.
Instead of a simplified and censored history, our Kansas sites and their visitors deserve an honest, complicated American narrative — if only for the next few days.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0161-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 04:57:46.974467

Bernie Sanders at a Labor Day rally in Portland, Maine on Sept. 1, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins returned to Congress this week after a month-long recess. While she made few public appearances during her time in Maine, some of her constituents seized opportunities to hear directly from her Democratic challengers.
What do those Mainers want? Many told Maine Morning Star they’d like to be represented by someone rooted in the community. They also said they want specifics — unambiguous plans for how to restore programs dismantled during President Donald Trump’s second term so far and make life more affordable. Plans that are different from the Democratic establishment. 
Some are already convinced they’ll find that in Graham Platner, the oysterman and military veteran from Sullivan who is backed by unions. But many Mainers are undecided, using town halls and rallies to find out more about the Democrats vying for Collins’ seat.
That was the case for Alfred Beattie of Dresden, a socialist-leaning Democrat who was one of more than 6,5000 people to attend the Labor Day rally Platner spoke at with independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Kevin Oster of Portland, a Democrat who didn’t know anything about Jordan Wood, a progressive former congressional aide, when he attended his town hall in Portland on Aug. 27. 
Beattie, Oster and others said those events and other upcoming public forums offered by Senate candidates are providing them with the type of opportunity they’ve been wanting from their sitting senator — to speak directly with her. 
Oster has attended “Where’s Susan” town halls, empty chair events constituents have organized to air their concerns. Some Mainers decried the lack of accessibility at some of Collins’ few public appearances in Maine during the recess. 
Officials had to move a ribbon cutting she attended to celebrate the completion of Searsport’s downtown revitalization inside because nearly 200 protesters lined the streets, some holding signs advocating for Platner. Following inside, the protesters drowned out Collins’ comments with booing.

When the town manager tried to bring the focus back to celebrating the project completion, someone yelled, “She doesn’t have a town hall, which is why we’re here.” Some protesters later interrupted Collins’ visit to the Bath Area Food Bank.
Collins’ press secretary Blake Kernen said the disruptions underscored the response she gave in the spring when Maine Morning Star asked Collins about constituent criticisms of her not hosting town halls.
“She prefers smaller group meetings or Zooms, rather than holding town halls where very few people get to speak, and the level of civility is often not that high,” Kernan said then. 
But many of her challengers are relying on those very forums to garner support. 
This includes Wood, whose town hall in Portland was the tenth of his planned tour throughout all 16 counties, Platner, who has also begun a series of his own scheduled across the state, as well as several of the lesser-known challengers. (Read more about all of the candidates in our voter guide.)
The latest to enter the race, co-founder of Maine Beer Company Dan Kleban, said he plans to tour the state and, whether it be town halls or casual conversations in his tasting room, he said, “I think we just have to do a lot more listening and a lot less talking at people.” 
Here’s what that listening so far has revealed about how Mainers are assessing Collins’ challengers: 
Concrete plans
Abby Huntoon of South Portland told Wood at his Aug. 27 town hall at the University of Southern Maine that she liked what he stood for and what he was telling the roughly 75 attendees. “But,” she said, “I personally feel it’s really important to hear specific ideas. I mean, everybody says they want to change things.” 
“How you’re going to attack things — I think that’s what we all want to know,” Huntoon said. 
Wood went on to outline some of his platform, such as reevaluating the tax code, but other questions from attendees returned to this idea of wanting concrete plans, especially when it comes to how to rebuild the structures Trump has dismantled or packed with his loyalists.

For example, a Portland resident said she’s worried about the next nor’easter after the gutting of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, America’s disaster relief agency.
“I would like to see a plan,” she said, “because I just see an endless pile of corruption and garbage just being dumped on the state of Maine because we’re not cooperating.” 
Collins’ victory over Democrat Sara Gideon in 2020 underscored the importance of a viable challenger having clear plans for how they can help Maine, Jerzy Sylvester of Peaks Island said at Platner’s rally on Labor Day. 
“Gideon lost because her only campaign was that she was going to beat Susan Collins and didn’t talk anything about what she was going to do for Maine people,” Sylvester said. 
The 25-year-old unenrolled from the Democratic Party a few years ago because he wasn’t satisfied with the message or candidates being endorsed, arguing they haven’t represented or looked out for the average working person. That’s the pitch many in the 2026 race are making.
Feeling ‘real’
Several of Collins’ challengers are emphasizing their working-class roots, living the same affordability challenges as their would-be constituents, and trying to draw a contrast to Collins, a now-multi-millionaire who is approaching 30 years in Congress.
“Most of my 20s I didn’t have money to pay for health insurance,” Kleban said. “I remember pulling into a gas station on an empty tank of gas and putting gas in my car, a gallon or two at a time. I remember, after a hard day’s work on a construction site or painting houses, going home and having a loaf of bread in some Tabasco sauce and I called that dinner. I remember vividly. Those are things you don’t forget.” 
Wood, pointing out his parents who attended his Portland town hall, said his family lived mostly paycheck to paycheck growing up, with his mother having to stop working when he was young because of the cost of child care.  
“These issues are not abstract to me,” he said. “They’re lived experiences.”

At the recent rally, Platner similarly spoke about his own challenges trying to start a family in the current economy and seeing friends driven out of the state due to what he called an affordability crisis.
“Piecing it together has always been a part of life, working multiple jobs, seasonal jobs, this is not a new thing for us,” he said of Mainers. “But in the past few years, it’s really beginning to feel like hard work is not enough.” 
That appeal is working for some Mainers. 
Before Platner took the stage, Portland resident Ryan Lizanecz, a 27-year-old Democrat who previously served on the Portland Charter Commission, said he’s drawn to Platner because “he’s a regular guy.”
He’d been familiar with Wood, but Platner has stuck out to him most so far. “He seems very genuine to me,” Lizanecz said. “I like that he speaks very plainly about issues.” 
Another Democratic Portland resident, Anthony Emerson, 30, said Platner “feels real,” pointing to his background being the harbormaster of a small town. 
Emerson is already likely voting for Platner in the primary and appreciates that he echoed many of the points Sanders has been pushing for decades. He criticized Maine for having a “professional political class,” noting that the children of two of the state’s current members of Congress are running for governor.  
“Graham is outside of that, which is appealing,” he said.

The appeal of “realness” voters are after also extends to how they’re funding their campaigns. 
Wood said he won’t be taking any money from corporate PACs or lobbyists. He also refuses to engage in selling individual stocks and will prohibit his family members and those of his staff from lobbying his office for issues. But, South Portland resident Rosemary Reed said at his town hall she has concerns about Wood’s husband’s ties to Mothership Strategies, a controversial Democratic fundraising firm.
Meanwhile, Democrats are currently going after Collins in a digital ad campaign for not backing her Republican colleague’s bill to ban lawmakers, presidents and vice presidents from trading stocks. 
And, reporting from Rolling Stone this week revealed the leader of a major private equity firm gave millions of dollars to a PAC backing Collins right before she cast a vote to advance Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Collins’ office strenuously objected to the idea that the contribution influenced Collins’ decision, but Platner took to social media to say in response, “I’ll be a senator for people who can’t buy senators.”
A shift away from the establishment
Part of what draws voters to Platner in particular is his distance from the establishment. As Democrats in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring Maine Gov. Janet Mills to enter the race, unions and community groups scouted Platner. 
Emerson compared Platner to Zohran Mamdani, who recently won the primary for New York mayor, and John Fetterman, the plainspoken former steel town mayor — pointing to Platner’s detailed platform and him being unafraid to call Israel’s war in Gaza a genocide. There is also overlap in their staff. Some of the progressive strategists behind Platner’s campaign also worked for Mamdani and Fetterman.
Fetterman also came to mind when Sophie Creamer of Brunswick, a 25-year-old who is not enrolled with a party, first heard about Platner. However, Creamer’s connection was out of worry that Platner would in time walk back his more progressive stances, as Fetterman has done since Trump was re-elected.
“The only thing that convinced me that it wouldn’t be another Fetterman was the fact that he has tribal sovereignty and indigenous rights on his website,” Creamer said.

While other Democrats have distanced themselves from those types of decolonial policies, Platner has embraced them.  
“I think that it’s important to have a more progressive Democrat to continue to push the Democratic Party in a way that actually represents the people that it’s supposed to represent,” Creamer said. 
With Mills, the Democratic establishment’s pick, still undecided, all of the candidates in that field are distancing themselves from the establishment to some extent.  
When asked where he stands politically compared with Platner, who’s leaning into democratic socialist ideals, Kleban said in an interview with Maine Morning Star, “I don’t know what to call myself. I’m a small business owner. I’m a get-shit-done Democrat.” 
But he said the Democratic Party needs to get better at turning anger into action to win back voters who split tickets. 
“They’re not going to give us our vote unless we can convince them that we’ve got their back and we’re going to try to come up with pragmatic solutions,” he said. 
Wood joked to Maine Morning Star that he “doesn’t expect Chuck Schumer’s endorsement any day” and is not under an illusion that the establishment likes primaries. 
Similar to how he sees the lack of town halls as a reason for eroding public trust in democracy, Wood said, “this idea that we shouldn’t have primaries in an open process also I think has undermined democracy because this is how voters participate and make the decision on the candidate that they want to move forward.”
