But the state can achieve the first without worsening the second, he says.","Maryland needs more clean energy but it doesn't need to consume farmland and open space to do so, writes Marshal Cahall, who points to options lke putting solar panels on manmade structures like roof and garages, and who said nuclear needs to be an option. (Stock photo/Getty images)Maryland is losing farmland at an alarming rate, with over 12,000 acres disappearing in just the last five years. This trend jeopardizes our food supply and drives up costs for local products. At the same time, our state undoubtedly needs to increase its domestic energy production.
But the sad fact is that recent policies intended to produce energy have put even more of our finite farmland at risk, threatening the very future of Maryland’s agriculture.
For instance, a new law overrides local zoning to fast-track solar development on agricultural land. Similarly, the controversial Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project transmission line raises the possibility of using eminent domain on farm parcels. These actions prioritize energy development without considering the long-term cost to one of our state’s most valuable resources — our finite and limited farmland.

Fortunately, we don’t have to choose between energy and agriculture. We can meet our energy goals by investing in smarter, more sustainable solutions.
First, let’s prioritize solar development on existing infrastructure. Solar panels should be placed on rooftops, over parking lots or on brownfields — areas that are already developed and don’t require the sacrifice of farmland. Incentivizing this approach would make these locations the default for new solar projects.
Second, we can leverage existing rights-of-way for new transmission lines. At the same time that the MPRP was being discussed, Baltimore Gas and Electric advanced a 59-mile project in a very similar area by utilizing existing pathways for transmission lines. Their project showed that by building necessary infrastructure on existing pathways, you avoid the need for eminent domain and prevent conflict with landowners.
Finally, and perhaps most effectively, Maryland can invest in nuclear energy. Long gone are the days when investing in nuclear energy was considered a risky proposition. Nuclear power is clean, highly efficient, and requires a minimal land footprint to produce a massive amount of energy.
Members of the Maryland Farm Bureau recently had the opportunity to tour Maryland’s lone nuclear energy facility, Calvert Cliffs. We were incredibly impressed by the efficiency, production and safety measures taken by the operation. This single facility contributes 87% of the state’s clean, carbon-free energy output. Imagine the impact even a single new reactor could have on our energy needs without consuming precious farmland.
Moving forward, our state leadership must choose a path that protects our farms while powering our future. By investing in these common-sense solutions, we can ensure Maryland remains a leader in both agriculture and energy.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-panels-in-field-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 18:57:02.465483

Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

The lawsuit is the second the state has faced that attempts to stop Magellan of Idaho’s plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The patients filed their lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday, and are seeking class-action status to protect all Idahoans on the program. 
Their arguments echo claims made by mental health clinics in a state court lawsuit last week: That the cuts would effectively end the program, risking worsening mental health conditions and overall public safety. 
The cuts, patients argue, “will have cascading negative consequences for plaintiffs and for their families, including increasing acuity of mental health symptoms, more frequent and intense mental health crises, and an overall functional decline in their day-to-day lives not only impacting family and social connections but also their own well-being and personal safety as well as the safety of others and the public at large.”
Magellan’s cuts, announced late last month, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The private company, which runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, plans to cut peer support services and the mobile treatment program, called Assertive Community Treatment, on Dec. 1.
Spokespeople for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Magellan declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying they don’t comment on pending litigation.

“Acting under color of state law, the government-official defendants either have directed or authorized the State’s contractor to make devastating changes to the administration of the … program,” patients argue in the lawsuit. “But their actions were unlawful, and this Court should grant relief to the plaintiffs.” 
One patient suing, identified only as Ramon in the lawsuit, has seen his symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia drastically improve since receiving services through the program that is slated to be cut, the lawsuit says.
“Ramon is a new person. He has leveled out, is consistent with his medications, and follows through with his … treatment and management plans,” the lawsuit says. Since receiving services through the program, “Ramon has not been incarcerated, hospitalized, or institutionalized, which is quite a change for him given his prior pattern of incarceration and hospitalization.”
Before he was on the program, “his family relationship had been severed,” the lawsuit says. But the program, the lawsuit said, “has been instrumental in reuniting Ramon with his family.” 
Many of the roughly 400 to 500 people on the program will end up homeless if the program ends, Tueller Counseling Clinical Director Tom Tueller previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Humphreys, 68, feels betrayed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. “As federal employees, we sacrificed good salaries in the private sector because we thought the benefits from government would be better now, in retirement,” he said.
As the nation’s largest employer-sponsored health insurance program, the FEHB Program covers more than 8.2 million federal government employees and retirees, and it was once celebrated as a national model for controlling costs while giving enrollees many health plan options.
But next year, average enrollee premium payments in the system are set to jump more than 12%, on top of a 13.5% hike in 2025. The two-year increase is higher than what many private employers and their workers are experiencing.
The FEHB rate hikes are similar to those for plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges — excluding the government subsidies most enrollees get, a major point of contention on Capitol Hill. The premiums insurers charge for Obamacare plans are rising 26% on average for 2026, following a 4% increase this year.
What’s making the latest hike in FEHB premium payments even harder to stomach for millions of federal employees is its timing: The 2026 increase was announced in October, when many federal workers were on unpaid furlough during the 43-day government shutdown.
Unlike most private employers, the FEHB Program gives its enrollees numerous health plans to choose from. That allows some people to lower their monthly premium payments by switching to plans with higher deductibles or copayments. But each year only about 5% of enrollees switch plans, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the program.
Humphreys, who has stayed with the same health plan for decades despite steadily higher prices, said it’s difficult determining which plan is best based on their health conditions. He has glaucoma and diabetes, and his wife, Julianne, has faced heart issues.
Their FEHB plan covers costs for their care not covered by Medicare, which typically pays 80% of their health bills.
“There’s a fear that if you do something and change plans and it’s wrong, you could be in a bad spot,” he said.
Open enrollment for federal employees and retirees runs through Dec. 8.
Among the factors causing premiums to increase, according to OPM, are an aging federal workforce with more chronic conditions, as well as prescription drug use, including pricey GLP-1 medications for weight loss.
About 42% of federal employees are over the age of 50, compared with 33% in the general workforce, OPM says. About 7% of federal employees are under the age of 30, compared with about 20% of workers overall.
OPM officials said the Trump administration’s policies aimed at lowering drug costs and focused on prevention of costly medical conditions will hopefully help it control premiums in the future.
“None of these initiatives of course will happen overnight – turning a $79 billion ship takes slow and steady progress,” Shane Stevens, OPM’s associate director for health care and insurance, said in a news release. “But, we are committed to improving the quality of life and quality of care for our members while also ensuring that healthcare remains accessible and affordable for those who work (or have worked) for the American people.”
OPM didn’t respond to requests for comment.

John Holahan, a health policy fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, said OPM’s explanation left out a key reason for rising premiums: hospital consolidation. While the FEHB Program is a collection of health plans, in many markets — including the Washington, D.C., area — those insurers must negotiate with a handful of powerful health systems that have bought up other hospitals and doctors. That market power enables them to drive prices higher on FEHB plans, he said.
Jacqueline D. Bowens, president and CEO of the D.C. Hospital Association, said in a statement that “the costs borne by patients are not determined solely by the care they receive, but by how insurance companies choose to price, reimburse, and restrict access to that care.”
Holahan said it’s surprising that FEHB premiums are rising even faster than those of other, smaller employers. But he is not surprised federal employees don’t switch plans more often, even when it may be in their financial interest.
“It’s that people find the health care world so complicated,” he said. Holahan, a noted health economist, said he, too, finds it daunting to switch Medicare health plans.
Mike Lindquist, a scientific review officer for the National Institutes of Health, said he’s not happy with the rise in his premium payments the past two years. “It’s tough, as it’s a big expense.”
Lindquist, 43, who lives in Brunswick, Maryland, has been on the same Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan through the FEHB Program the past few years even though he evaluates his options each fall.
“By not switching, you don’t have to worry about choosing a new plan that might not take your practitioners,” he said.
Jonathan Foley, a health consultant who worked as a senior adviser at OPM during the Biden administration, said premium increases will be a hardship for many enrollees. While the FEHB Program offers 200 health plans in total, with about 10 to 20 in each geographic market, enrollment is concentrated in just a handful of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
“This concentration reduces competition and gives outsize influence” to rate increases by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Foley said in an email.
He said the FEHB Program also faces higher costs because it requires its health plans to cover GLP-1 medications, such as Wegovy and Ozempic. Nationally, fewer than half of large employers offer this benefit, according to the Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Another cost pressure has been more members using behavioral health benefits to treat depression and anxiety since the start of the covid pandemic, Foley said.
The Trump administration’s federal workforce reductions also have contributed to cost increases, Foley said. OPM has lost about a third of its employees in the past year, leaving fewer workers to oversee the FEHB Program and negotiate with dozens of health insurers, he said.
“The workforce reductions and the unpredictable nature of policymaking in the Trump administration has created considerable uncertainty among health insurance carriers,” Foley said. “The response of actuaries to increased uncertainty is to raise rates.”
A Government Accountability Office report this year found that recent OPM staffing vacancies led to a suspension of fraud risk assessments in the FEHB Program.
John Hatton, staff vice president for policy and programs at an advocacy group called the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, said higher prices mean it’s critical for FEHB members to shop and compare plans for next year. “The program was designed to promote competition to mitigate and drive down costs,” he said.
Hatton said OPM surveys show the main reasons people don’t change plans is they are overwhelmed by their options and worried about making a mistake. Switching to a plan with even a slightly higher deductible, he said, could save people a few hundred dollars a month on premiums.
But Humphreys, the Georgia retiree, said he likes that his current plan comes with low out-of-pocket costs for him and his wife. They owed little money when his wife suffered a kidney stone infection and sepsis, which put her in the hospital for 12 days.
That reassurance will soon come at a higher cost: Their FEHB and Medicare premiums will take up more than half of his pension check next year after accounting for taxes.
“I can take a lower-premium plan, but it’s a gamble I am not willing to take,” he said.

In Southeast Vermont, a group of school districts are already out of the gate putting into practice a key feature of the redistricting task force’s proposal — forming regional cooperatives to share services. 
For several years, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union — which serves students in the towns of Woodstock, Barnard, Bridgewater, Killington, Plymouth, Pomfret and Reading — has been partnering with seven nearby districts in Windham, Windsor and Rutland counties to pool their resources under the Vermont Learning Collaborative.
Officials there say the initiative shows clear cost benefits and improvements to educational programs, two central goals of Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law.

The districts’ collaborative — a precursor to the type of regional entity now being proposed by the task force — facilitates the sharing of services in special education, professional development, human resources and more.
A state law passed in 2024 enables districts in Vermont to form a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, or BOCES. The Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s collaborative will soon be officially recognized by the state’s Agency of Education as the first in the state.
The five regional partnerships envisioned in the task force’s proposal, called Cooperative Service Areas, would similarly allow districts to collaborate and save money by sharing services at scale.
The educational structure is commonplace in much of the United States. Forty-three states, including smaller, rural states like West Virginia, Maine, Mississippi and Montana, utilize a form of regional cooperative service agencies.
The collaborative has generated cost savings for participating districts, officials with the Mountain Views Supervisory Union said. Districts that would otherwise be siloed and forced to pay for duplicative services have been able to access professional development services at a larger scale thanks to their collaborative, saving individual districts an average of 66% on those costs, according to Jill Graham, the collaborative’s executive director.
The task force’s proposal has generated interest throughout the state. Other districts have approached the Agency of Education about adopting a similar structure, according to previous reporting. Campaign Vermont, an advocacy group, said in a release that the state could save $334 million annually if districts share services.
The Mountain Views districts’ special education services have also seen improvement. Their collaboration has led to a reduction in the number of students who are placed outside of member districts, school officials said.
“We are seeing the impact of this resource,” said Sherry Sousa, the superintendent of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union. “And we’re getting the payback.”
Sousa says the Agency of Education is reviewing the articles of agreement between the partnering supervisory districts and will soon approve its formation. The approval comes with a $10,000 grant from the state.
‘Legacy inefficiencies’
The task force’s proposal was finalized in a draft report that will be sent to the legislature by December 1. But it has faced heavy criticism from Gov. Phill Scott’s administration.
Scott has made direct consolidation of the state’s 52 supervisory unions and supervisory districts and 119 school districts a key priority of the broader reform envisioned in Act 73. 
The change would wrest control of local spending away from school districts, but much of the law’s changes to education finance may not happen without agreement on a new map of districts.
Regional cooperatives are one facet of the task force’s proposal for the public education reform envisioned by Act 73. The group is recommending voluntary mergers of the state’s school districts.
Those mergers could be incentivized by using state construction aid to facilities creating regional high schools, a more long-term proposal in their recommendation.
Gov. Phil Scott and his education secretary, Zoie Saunders have panned the proposal, and said the task force ignored their mandate to consolidate the state’s existing districts and draw new maps of those possible boundaries.
Saunders, in a letter to the task force, said their plan “inverts the Governor’s original plan” by maintaining the state’s 52 supervisory unions and districts and 119 school districts, “while adding” five regional entities on top.
Each regional cooperative, she wrote, would “have its own governing board, executive director, and staff—expanding, not reducing, administrative footprint,” she wrote.
“The result is more governance, more overhead, and the preservation of legacy inefficiencies,” she wrote.
Scott was more forceful in his criticism, telling reporters this month that the task force “failed” in their task.
“They didn’t redraw the lines, and they were supposed to put forward three maps for consideration, and they failed,” Scott said.
Task force members have pushed back on this. In a draft of their final report, task force members wrote that they could not find evidence that direct consolidation of school districts would help alleviate primary cost drivers like health insurance, special education, facilities and transportation.
“Regional coordination, shared staffing, and well-planned high school collaborations address these drivers more effectively than mandated structural change,” the task force wrote.
The disagreements between task force members and officials in Scott’s administration foreshadow a difficult legislative session to come. Lawmakers will have to agree on a new map of school districts for much of Act 73 to see the light of day.
The debate has generated a vast amount of uncertainty in the state’s public education landscape. Keri Bristow, the board chair of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, said the task force’s proposal preserves a local democratic process.
“You can make any map you want, but if the people don’t have any affinity with the other groups they’re pushed with, there’s just going to be a lot of problems trying to meld those people, those groups, into an Uber School District,” Bristow said. “We would prefer to choose our partners.”

The state Department of Corrections announced the Thanksgiving night death of 37-year-old Larry Thomas Dukes Franklin on Friday. Franklin was incarcerated at the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s maximum security Jameson Annex in Sioux Falls.
DCI spokesman Tony Mangan confirmed that the agency is investigating the situation as a suspected overdose.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Franklin’s death is the fourth this month in the state’s prison system. Overdoses are suspected in two of the other November deaths, of 33-year-old Travis Long Fox at the penitentiary, and 46-year-old Timothy Tyree at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield.
Shane Ostercamp, 44, also died in November. He died in a comfort care setting in Springfield.
Five other inmates died of suspected or confirmed overdoses this year before November, all but one from a synthetic drug known as “K2” or “spice.” 
Attorney General Marty Jackley has indicted a handful of people in and outside the prison system for drug distribution, including one former corrections officer. Of the eight total suspected overdose deaths this year, four occurred after Jackley announced the most recent round of charges in mid-September. One of the deaths occured less than a week after the press conference announcing them.
Twenty-two men have now died in Department of Corrections custody in calendar year 2025, the highest figure in recent memory. In addition to the drug deaths, four died by suicide and others died of natural causes.

Valerie Brown doesn’t personally know her two classmates at Western International High School who were detained Thursday morning by federal immigration officials and sent to Texas, but that didn’t stop her from helping organize a press conference that became a rally for bringing the students home.
“I have friends who have told me they are afraid to go to school. You shouldn’t be afraid to come to school,” Brown told Chalkbeat after speaking during the press conference, saying the fear is magnified by rumors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking kids “whether they have papers or not.”
“They’re scared to be outside, to be with their friends. They’re kids.”
The press conference was organized to support the two 16-year-old students, who are cousins and attend Western International High School in Southwest Detroit. Outlier Media and Chalkbeat reported Monday that students were born in Venezuela and arrived in the U.S. in 2023. They were taken into custody along with two of their parents when agents raided their home on the Eastide in search of a different migrant.
Brown and others spoke in front of a backdrop at Detroit’s Clark Park. Dozens of people were there, some of them holding signs and shouting “for shame” whenever a speaker brought up something they thought was particularly egregious. All of them called for the release of the teens and the parents.
Some of the speakers, including Valerie, called on school, city, and state officials to be more involved in ensuring the safety of students who fear moving throughout the community because of immigration actions. Some called on the Detroit school district to have an immigration attorney on retainer to assist students who’ve been detained and to ensure students know their rights.
“Instead of the (students) chilling with their friends, they got to be stuck in a detention center with ICE,” Brown said during her speech. “We don’t even know where they’re going. We don’t even know if they’re going to a country that’s theirs or is even safe for them or even if they have family anymore.”
One of the speakers, attorney George Washington, said ICE agents entered the home while the occupants were sleeping. “Suddenly, ICE appears at the door, busts into the place, and tells them that they’re all being arrested.”
All four who were detained had pending asylum petitions, Washington said.
“We have a tremendous immigration lawyer from Detroit who did everything he could,” to assist the four while they remained in Michigan. But, Washington said, they were sent to Texas “too quick.”
“He’s going to continue representing them and we’re going to get them out,” Washington said.
After the event, Sen. Stephanie Chang, a Democrat from Detroit, issued a statement about the detentions:
“I am standing with Detroit teachers, friends, family and community members of these two students in urging their immediate return home to Michigan,” Chang said. “I understand that they have been following the asylum process and have upcoming immigration court dates. ICE should release them and allow them to proceed with the asylum process.”
Many of the youth attending the event were from Western International, located across the street from Clark Park. Others came from schools such as Southeastern, Cass Technical, and Detroit International Academy for Young Women.
Kenneth Russell, who attends Southeastern, was among the speakers.
“It’s better for us to all be connected than apart,” Russell said.
“It’s awful what’s happening,” said Theo Edwards, who’s attended Western for nearly a month. He was holding a sign that said “People are not illegal,” with the “not” underlined. “It’s scary, especially for those who are Hispanic.”

He also serves as president of the Vermont AFL-CIO, advocating for workers’ rights in the Green Mountain state.
Recently, the richest person in the world was granted a salary of $1 trillion over 10 years.
Let that sink in. $1,000,000,000,000.


One person will receive ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS per year for 10 years to run a company. One person, already unimaginably wealthy, was handed more money than the total budget of the state of Vermont, not to mention that a trillion dollars is larger than most countries’ GDP.
At the same time of that announcement, tens of thousands of federal employees went to work and didn’t get paid because of the government shutdown. Millions of poor and working-class Americans didn’t receive their SNAP benefits and struggled to feed their families. And health care costs for working people are sky rocketing with no end in sight.
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives, the leaders we elected to run the government, didn’t meet for over a month. The president, with no sense of irony, threw a Great-Gatsby–themed party, a celebration of excess named after a story that was supposed to warn us about it.
The rich got richer. People went to work and didn’t get paid. Millions went hungry. And somehow, this has become normal.
What is happening in our country?
We used to value work. We believed that if you worked hard, you’d earn enough to live with dignity. One job could support you and your family. Now, too many companies and politicians treat workers as disposable and view the economy not as a shared project, but as a game to be won by a handful of shareholders.
The results are everywhere: record corporate profits, record CEO pay, and record levels of despair among working people. The rich continue to spend, propping up our economy while millions of people look for food. When the system rewards hoarding instead of helping, and speculation instead of service, it’s no wonder faith in the American dream is fading.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We can value labor over luxury, community over greed, and people over profits. But that means demanding more — from our government, from corporations and from ourselves. 
At the Vermont AFL-CIO, we  work every day to support workers throughout the state and raise up their voices. Through the power of collective bargaining and union organizing, working families in the Green Mountain State can restore hope for tomorrow.
Our strength lies in our unity, whether on the picket line, at the bargaining table or in the halls of government. We are one movement fighting for justice for all. We are building a future where every Vermonter earns a fair wage, has a safe workplace and can live with dignity and security. 
Because if we keep rewarding the richest for taking and punishing the rest for working, we won’t just lose our paychecks. We’ll lose our soul as a country.

(Photo by Keith Weller/USDA)Artificial intelligence and robots have potential to boost agricultural production — and their possibilities are only beginning, a University of Florida researcher told the Florida Senate last week.
UF broke ground this month on the Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture at the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Hillsborough County.
According to Nathan Boyd, a professor at UF studying weed science and associate director of the center, artificial intelligence will provide a 35% boost to agricultural production, including in Florida, by 2030. 
“We’re just seeing the start of what artificial intelligence and robotics can do in agriculture,” Boyd said while presenting to the Senate Committee on Agriculture.
Using AI to target spraying and harvesting crops could allow use of fewer pesticides and streamline processes otherwise done by humans, he said.
“Labor is a critical issue. The reason it’s becoming more of an issue is, number one, we do have aging farm operators — that’s part of it. We also do not have or have a very, very small domestic labor force for agriculture, which means we’re relying on labor outside of our domestic population, and the result of that has been labor shortages. And if you look at population trends here and in other countries, this is going to get worse, not better,” Boyd continued. 
As of May 2024, Florida had 9,640 crop, nursery, and greenhouse workers, the second-most in the United States, behind only California, which has more than 10 times as many workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area had the highest number in the state and 11th most nationwide.
As of April, Florida farmers paid near the bottom of the nation to field crop workers at $15.71 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Earlier this year, in the thick of legislative discourse about cracking down on illegal immigration, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson predicted the effort would not affect farm help. About two-thirds of crop farmworkers in the U.S. are immigrants, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. At the time, Simpson said H2A visas give permission to “the vast majority” of farmers to hire foreign nationals on a temporary basis.

“We have to come up with a solution of, ‘How are we going to continue to grow the food that we do in Florida, understanding that we feed our country in the winter time? How are we going to continue to do that with fewer people?’ So, here comes the robots,” Boyd said. 
As technology improves, so do yields and quality of products, Boyd said. Technology can monitor plant health and development.
The technology, although often more accessible to larger growers, can be developed for small growers, according to Boyd.  
The Florida Department of Commerce, upon groundbreaking for the center, named agricultural technology as a new target industry. That means the state recognizes it as having a high potential to generate “significant returns on investment through job creation, innovation, and long-term growth.”

Robotic harvesting, a $236 million industry in 2022, is expected to be worth $6.8 billion by 2030, according to Boyd. Agriculture drones are expected to constitute a $18 billion dollar industry in five years, too.
The center at UF will have resources to design and build robots for agriculture, with about 100 employees. In the 2025 state budget, lawmakers dedicated $2.25 million for the center.

Vermont policymakers see the five-year grant, worth an annual $100 million-plus, as a potential lifeline in the face of looming Medicaid spending cuts, though they also caution the funds cannot replace that lost revenue.

The wishlist for achieving a more stable health care system in Vermont is a long and lofty one: By 2031, the Agency of Human Services says it aims to strengthen the rural health care workforce in the state and increase access to timely care in those rural areas, all while increasing quality and reducing cost. 
One big piece of achieving those goals rests in moving more of the health care Vermonters receive outside of hospitals, the agency argues in its latest vision for hospital transformation, made public last week.
In a bid for a five-year federal rural health grant worth at least $500 million to the state, the agency proposes a sweeping range of expenditures, ranging from the broad — like allocations for incentivizing primary care providers to increase appointment access — to the specific — like funding more recovery housing for those with substance use disorders or investing in dialysis and ventilator units in nursing homes, rather than hospitals.

What might become a reality depends in part on grant funding decisions the federal government is expected to make by the end of this year.
The national opportunity became available in September after funding for the program was inserted into the federal budget reconciliation package to win the needed support of rural Senate Republicans concerned about the impacts of Medicaid spending cuts in that bill. 
Since then, health care professionals across Vermont have closely watched how the state might use the grant, to solidify the otherwise eroding foundation of the health care system in the state. 
“It does give us a lifeline if we use it really well,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told VTDigger in October, before the state submitted an application.
Still, now that the agency’s application is public, much remains up in the air about how much funding will come to the state and what exactly it will go toward when it does.
The new funding availability comes at a time when the majority of Vermont’s hospitals face serious solvency risks and Vermonters bear some of the highest health care costs in the country. At the same time, the state’s rural populations are overall less healthy than the rest of the state, with higher rates of chronic disease, obesity, opiod-related death and suicide.
Many providers, patients, regulators and lawmakers in the state agree that the system is in dire need of a radical reboot. Some are still waiting for the details of that reboot to become more concrete.
“The proposal is more of a list of priorities than a detailed plan of what Vermont would do with federal funds if or when they arrive,” Alex Garlick, a UVM political science professor who specializes in health care policy but who is not involved in the application process, told VTDigger. 
“The ideas for shoring up the delivery of rural health care are sound, but I’d categorize them as incremental instead of transformational,” he said.
‘A holistic view’
Part of the plan’s high-level scope is because of how the federal government plans to dole out the funding.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they will award $10 billion a year between 2026 and 2030. Each year, half of that will go equally to each approved state — suggesting that each of the 50 eligible U.S. states are expected to get $100 million per year. The remaining $5 billion pot will go to states based on a more competitive grant evaluation criteria. 
Agency staff think it’s likely that Vermont will receive only its share of the half promised to all states, said Julie Mazza Olson, AHS’s director of Medicaid and health systems, who oversaw the application process. The federal agency has already posted its scoring metrics that the state can judge its eligibility against.
Nevertheless, the state proposed a budget for $200 million of spending each year in part to make a bid for the higher amount. But also the state agency can’t be sure which of the proposed priorities the feds will accept as ways to spend the state’s allocation, so Olson says the agency intentionally made the application flexible.
Olson said her agency tried to build upon programs for health system transformation that the state has already set in motion largely through a 2022 law, known as Act 167, a bill focused on shoring up the state’s hospitals. 
That was a practical necessity because the application needed to come together quickly: CMS released the applications in mid-September and gave states until Nov. 5 to submit them. 
“It’s a really really short amount of time to develop a plan and get the kind of input that you want when you’re doing something as complex as this,” Olson said.
Still, while trying to move quickly by building off existing projects, Olson said that the agency also tried to broaden the scope beyond hospital-specific reform. Often receiving care in a hospital is more expensive than getting the same treatment in an outpatient clinic or independent facility.
“If we’re going to have less care in hospitals, we’re going to need more care somewhere else,” Olson said. “There are other providers who we haven’t really engaged with in the same way on transformation.” 
Specifically, the application identifies investments in staff, technology and supplies for nursing homes, home health care, community mental health and substance use clinics, as well as through increased support and training for EMTs and paramedic emergency response teams.
Garlick, the UVM professor, specifically pointed to training programs for licensed nursing assistants and supporting primary care as good ideas for ways to strengthen the delivery of rural health care. 
“There are also outside-the-box considerations, including grants to increase the housing stock available to health care workers, which show the state is taking a holistic view of the problems related to health care finance,” he said.
A far bigger federal challenge  
Health care officials remain clear-eyed about the importance these funds can have in boosting a system in such dire straits. 
“Vermont’s healthcare system, including all provider types, remains under significant financial strain,” Foster, the care board chair, wrote in a Friday email to VTDigger. “We are seeing many service line closures and disruptions to patient care.  Hospitals are expected to continue to experience great financial pressure at a time when Vermonters cannot afford to pay more for healthcare.” 
Foster wrote that he was optimistic that Vermont’s application for the program would garner support, adding that he was encouraged by its recognition of the importance of preventative care and community-based providers. “Vermont has committed to intentional and meaningful health system transformation, and these critical funds would bolster our ability to transition Vermont into a sustainable and modern health system,” he said.
Still, strong headwinds remain against the rural health care system across the country as well as in Vermont. 
The changes to Medicaid enshrined in the big budget reconciliation President Donald Trump signed into law this July could result in a $137 billion loss to rural hospitals over 10 years, an analysis by the health care news organization KFF found. Comparatively, this five-year $50 billion rural health transformation grant, also included in that law, cannot balance the scale.
“The dollars that are available to us are really addressing a different set of concerns than the dollars that we’re losing. This is an opportunity, and we want to use this opportunity, but from a policy perspective it doesn’t make up for [other losses],” Olson said. 
Those losses don’t include the potential drop in income that rural hospitals can expect to come as a result of the loss of some of the federal subsidies for plans purchased on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. Thousands of Vermonters are expected to reduce or entirely drop their insurance due to the increased expense.
The KFF authors also point out another imbalance of this funding opportunity that Vermont officials are also keenly aware of: While the changes to Medicaid would require future congressional action to ever reverse the cuts, this federal funding opportunity is finite. After five years, it is gone.
“It’s one-time money, so we have to think about how we can invest in ways to sustain it or turn things on and off,” Olson said. 
It’s an opportunity, she sees, to strengthen the system at the root, to do things like invest in concrete pieces of equipment — ventilators, mobile care technology — or programs that will have long dividends for the state, like education and training for the health care workforces.
She is wary of seeing it as the catch-all solution for all the challenges the system is facing.  
“The rural health transformation grant is not our entire healthcare system or all the things we’re doing on healthcare reform,” she said. “It’s an opportunity that we want to make the best of, even if it does not solve all of our problems.”

Free.,Trump social media post claims to void Biden orders,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-social-media-post-claims-void-biden-orders,,"President Donald Trump said Friday he will try to reverse any law, pardon or still-in-effect executive order that former President Joe Biden signed with an autopen, though it wasn’t immediately clear how that would work or whether it would be legal. Trump declared in a social media post that any documents Biden signed with the autopen are “hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.”“I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” Trump alleged. “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The White House press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for the list of documents Trump believes he has the ability to rescind based on the manner they were signed.States Newsroom also asked the Trump administration if officials believe the president would need to sign an executive order in order to implement his social media post. Experts dismissed earlier autopen challenge The post was similar to one Trump published in March when he claimed any pardons Biden signed with the autopen were void, something legal experts said at the time was “absurd” and a “red herring.”Trump brought up his frustration with autopen use again in June when he ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when and why Biden administration staff used an autopen. Trump said during an Oval Office appearance at the time he hadn’t found any evidence Biden aides violated the law.“No, but I've uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country.”Biden and spokespeople working for him have repeatedly said he knew what official documents were being signed in his name and rejected claims that White House staff used the autopen without his authorization or knowledge. Biden released a statement in June following the Trump memorandum, saying the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote at the time. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""While presidents have regularly rescinded their predecessors executive orders, usually within their first few days or weeks in office, Congress would very likely need to act in order to alter or eliminate any laws that Biden signed with an autopen. Trump seeking to overturn a law, or part of a law, unilaterally would likely lead to a lawsuit over whether he holds that power. Trump doesn’t cite legal authorityIt also wasn’t immediately clear what legal authority Trump believes he has as president to undo pardons if Biden used an autopen to sign the documents. David Super, a constitutional and administrative law professor at Georgetown University, told States Newsroom in March that “the Constitution does not require signatures for pardons. It simply says the president has the power to pardon.”“So if President Biden wanted to simply verbally tell someone they're pardoned, he could do that. It wouldn't have to be in writing at all,” he said. “Administratively, of course, we want things in writing. It makes things a lot simpler, but there's no constitutional requirement.”Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217

State officials took it as a warning.","Concerned that residents’ locations and schedules could be obtained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, state lawmakers passed a bill this month to prevent public agencies from sharing such personal information.
The bill prohibits state and municipal agencies, including schools, from sharing an individual’s address, hours of work, public agency appointments or “any other information that provides the date, time or place where such individual may be located.”
Scott Gaul, the state’s chief data officer, said he will be working with agencies on procedures that protect the outlined information and how to handle requests for data.
“The underlying intent of the legislation is to make sure people can trust in government and feel that they can interact with state agencies and the benefits that they’re entitled to,” said Gaul.
Since March, the Trump administration has required states to provide “unfettered access” to information like names, birth dates, addresses and Social Security numbers from all state programs that receive federal funding. Connecticut did not comply.
Then, federal officials approached the state’s third-party vendor for SNAP recipients’ personal information.
The vendor turned down the request, but it was a warning to Gaul and others that personal information could be obtained through unexpected — and “aggressive” — means, Gaul said.
Gaul spoke recently at a series of seminars geared at helping nonprofits understand how to protect their clients’ sensitive information when data requests come through the back door.
At one seminar, Eric Giannella, a researcher at Georgetown’s Massive Data Institute, advised nonprofits to provide default answers for sensitive questions and use encryption keys.
But Giannella acknowledged that many of these methods have traditionally only been available to large organizations that have designated technology staff.
For Tabitha Sookdeo, executive director of CT Students for a Dream, it feels like a “Catch-22. You’re trying to protect [your clients’] data, but you really need it for your organization’s function.”
For example, in July, Sookdeo needed to find the parent contact information for a high schooler who was picked up by ICE. Sookdeo needed to have the data on hand but was concerned that if it were obtained by ICE, it would present a risk for her client. 
“We have to become data experts,” she said.
The new legislation protects data held by Connecticut agencies, but it cannot stop federal agencies, such as the IRS, from sharing data with ICE. 
Sookdeo has been fielding questions from young immigrants and their families about whether to pay their taxes this year. For many, “the benefits outweigh the risk, because, for lots of immigration purposes, if you’re filing and you’re in the process of trying to get something, you have to show continuous tax paying activity,” said Sookdeo.
Attorney General William Tong joined a multistate lawsuit in July challenging the Trump administration’s effort to collect SNAP recipients’ personal data. He also joined a lawsuit that blocks HHS from sharing personal information of Medicaid recipients with ICE.
Sookdeo notes that the new legislation does not specifically address reproductive health care, or the sex or gender of a person. Chelsea-Infinity Gonzalez, director of public policy and advocacy at the ACLU, said, “It’s encouraging that the legislature recognized this and took an initial step during the special session.”
While Connecticut has existing shield laws and “best practices” around maintaining demographic data privacy, “something that Connecticut does not have are really holistic privacy policies for the public sector,” said Gaul. “I think this is kind of a step in that direction. But, you know, there is more that could be done on that.”
Democratic control of both the executive and legislative branches has assisted Connecticut’s ability to protect its own data, Gaul said. Last week’s legislation passed largely on party lines, with three Republicans joining the vote to send the bill to Lamont’s desk.
In Vermont, Republican Governor Phil Scott obliged the federal government’s request and handed over the data of SNAP beneficiaries, despite opposition from a Democratic-controlled legislature.
Connecticut has also been impacted by budget cuts to federal data collection.
States rely on the federal government to “set standards” of how data like race and address are collected, Gaul said. The Census homepage went dark one weekend, and the Department of Justice no longer collects data on gender-identity-based hate crimes, raising doubt about the reliability of federal statistical data.
For now, Connecticut will be selective of any cross-state data sharing initiatives, Gaul said. Some initiatives may been a “great idea three years ago,” but not now.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25161836500390-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217

“The First Eight,” which hit shelves Nov. 11, interweaves the achievements and challenges of the state’s Black representatives in post-Civil War 1800s with Clyburn’s own experience during his three decades in Congress, he said.
“People are shocked when I tell them that there were eight African Americans representing South Carolina in Congress before me,” Clyburn told the SC Daily Gazette. “They are absolutely flabbergasted when I tell them at one point South Carolina had five members of the House of Representatives, and four of the five were Black.
“And they are beyond belief when I tell them that there’s 95 years between number eight on this list and yours truly, number nine.”
Rep. George Washington Murray left office in 1897. Clyburn was first elected in 1992.
For years, South Carolina’s only Democratic congressman worked on the stories strictly as historical accounts. That changed with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by a mob attempting to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the next president. The attack only delayed certification by hours.
Clyburn’s mind went back to the 1876 governor’s race, when the paramilitary Red Shirts who supported Confederate Gen. Wade Hampton used violence and intimidation to keep Black men from voting. Hampton’s victory brought the end of Reconstruction, the post-Civil War period of federal control in the South, as President Rutherford B. Hayes — needing the electoral votes of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana to take office — agreed to withdraw federal troops.
Clyburn decided to draw parallels from the experiences of his predecessors to current events.
“What I decided was, rather than just inform, it needed to be sort of constructive,” Clyburn said.
Nation’s first
Clyburn’s book begins with Joseph Rainey, the nation’s first Black congressman, who represented South Carolina from 1870 to 1879.
Though Rainey was born a slave in Georgetown, his father bought the family’s freedom when he was 10 and moved to Charleston, where he was secretly tutored and worked as a barber at the Mills House hotel. After the Civil War, Rainey helped found the state Republican Party and was a delegate to the majority-Black convention that wrote South Carolina’s 1868 constitution that allowed the state to rejoin the Union.
Rainey won a special election two years later to represent South Carolina’s 1st District and was reelected four times, becoming the longest-serving Black congressman during Reconstruction. In 2022, a room in the U.S. Capitol was renamed in his honor.
Clyburn’s narrative tells the stories behind each of the eight men.
Among them are Robert Smalls, who Clyburn called “the most consequential South Carolinian who ever lived.”
Also born into slavery, Smalls hijacked the Confederate supply ship he worked on in 1862 and steered his family and fellow enslaved crew members to freedom. Piloting past Confederate forts, he delivered the ammunition-laden Planter to the Union.
Smalls then became the first Black man to pilot ships for the U.S. Navy.
He too helped write the state’s 1868 constitution, which undid the Black Codes and promised free education for all children and voting rights to all men. His five terms in the U.S. House are especially remarkable when considering they followed the end of Reconstruction and the reversal of rights for freed slaves.
He also attended the post-Reconstruction rewriting of the state constitution. As a Black delegate to the mostly white 1895 convention, Smalls pleaded unsuccessfully for a constitution guaranteeing “fair and honest” elections, even while recognizing the purpose of the convention was to disenfranchise Black voters.
A statue of him is in the works, for placement on the Statehouse grounds.
Although Smalls’ story stands out for its heroism, the most interesting story to Clyburn is that of Thomas Miller, the state’s seventh Black congressman.
A state legislator before and after his stint in Congress, Miller briefly held the seat previously represented by Smalls after successfully contesting the results of the 1888 election on the grounds that Black voters were prevented from casting ballots. A vote by Congress didn’t seat him until September 1890. He lost re-election later that year in another disputed contest.
Miller was raised by two freed slaves, Richard and Mary Ferrebee Miller. But he had fair skin and claimed both of his biological parents were white. Whether that’s true is unknown.


Where to see Clyburn talk about the book
At 10 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 6 at the University of South Carolina Joseph F. Rice Law School Auditorium, with moderator Bobby Donaldson, of the USC Center for Civil Rights History and Research


Regardless, Miller presented himself as African American. Born in 1849, Miller moved to Charleston with his parents two years later and attended schools for free Black children. During the Civil War, he delivered newspapers between Charleston and Savannah, where he spent two weeks in a Union prison camp. He completed his education after the war, graduating from Hudson School in north of New York City and Lincoln University, still a historically Black college in Pennsylvania.
In 1872, he returned to South Carolina and earned a law degree from the then-integrated University of South Carolina before the end of Reconstruction closed it to Black students.
Like Smalls, Miller was a delegate to the mostly white 1895 convention that rewrote the state constitution. He went on to found what became South Carolina State University, Clyburn’s alma mater, and served as its first president from 1896 to 1911.
People don’t know these stories as well as they should, Clyburn said. That much is clear in how often people tell him they think he is South Carolina’s first Black representative, he said.
He also often sees misunderstandings about what it meant to be a Republican or a Democrat in his predecessors’ era, he said. All eight who came before him were Republicans.
Through telling the men’s stories, he hopes to correct the record and leave people better informed.
“I’m doing my part with this book to try to fill a gap in the education of people in South Carolina,” Clyburn said.
Clyburn continues to see echoes of the past in the news. Recently, that’s been through calls to redraw congressional maps across the country in efforts to pick up more seats for a single party, he said.
Voting lines must be redrawn after every census to account for population changes, since each U.S. House member is supposed to represent roughly the same number of people. But this year’s changes are occurring mid-way through the normal decennial process.
South Carolina has made no moves toward an interim redrawing, especially since a court fight over the state’s most recent maps ended just two months ago.
Some ultra-conservative members of the Freedom Caucus have called for redrawing the maps to potentially replace Clyburn with a Republican in the 6th District, which was gerrymandered after the 1990 census to create a majority-Black district. Clyburn has represented it ever since. But those proposals are unlikely to gain any traction.
Still, Clyburn likened the nationwide attempts to alter voting maps to the 1895 rewrite of the state constitution that ushered in the Jim Crow-era South.
In addition to South Carolina lacking a single Black congressman for nearly a century, the state Legislature had no Black representation for seven decades. In 1970, voters elected James Felder, Herbert Fielding, and I.S. Leevy Johnson to the state House. The number of Black legislators jumped to 13 four years later, after a lawsuit forced the state to redraw voting lines.
“Are we going to learn from the lessons that I tried to share in this book about what happened in 1877 (at the end of Reconstruction)?” Clyburn said. “Or are we going to sit idly by and allow history to repeat itself?”
Despite its warnings about letting history repeat itself, the book ends on a hopeful note, he said.
In the epilogue, Clyburn points to South Carolina’s less popular official motto: “prepared in mind and resources.” The saying reminds him of one of his favorite Bible verses, Hebrews 11:1: “Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.”
“What that says to me is that just because you do not see success doesn’t mean you should not prepare for success,” Clyburn said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Clyburn-92NY.jpg,,,2025-11-28 14:57:19.368099

The U.S. State Department confirmed the release of Mohammed Ibrahim in a statement sent to the Phoenix on Friday. “The Department of State welcomes the news […],"Screenshot of video taken of Mohammed Ibrahim on Thursday (from CAIR-Florida press release)A 16-year-old Palestinian American youth from Brevard County was released from an Israeli prison Thursday after being held since February on allegations of rock throwing in the West Bank.
The U.S. State Department confirmed the release of Mohammed Ibrahim in a statement sent to the Phoenix on Friday.
“The Department of State welcomes the news of the release of U.S. citizen Mohammed Ibrahim from detention in Israel,” said a State Department spokesperson, who added that “the Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens.”
During a press conference in Tampa in August, an attorney for his family said that Ibrahim had originally been held in Israel’s Megiddo Prison, where they said he had contracted scabies but been denied medical treatment. Family members said he had lost more than 25 pounds since his detention began.
In a press release issued Thursday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)’s Florida chapter, the organization said it had shared a sworn statement with members of Congress detailing how Ibrahim had been “beaten with rifle butts, starved, denied medical care, and threatened by masked interrogators who coerced him into a false confession under fear of further violence.”
CAIR and CAIR-Florida are calling on the State Department, members of Congress, faith leaders, and civil-society organizations to press for a full public accounting of Ibrahim’s treatment and “concrete consequences for the Israeli officials responsible.”
NPR reported earlier this month Ibrahim had been charged with two counts of stone-throwing at a moving vehicle, which could have resulted in a penalty of 20 years. A military court had been scheduled to hear his case on Dec. 15.
The Guardian reported earlier this month that the Israeli embassy in Washington had been circulating a letter in the nation’s capital defending its nine-month detention of Ibrahim and the medical treatment. The publication said the letter had not mentioned his dramatic weight loss or that his family had virtually no contact with him since he was arrested in February for allegedly throwing “rocks at vehicles belonging to Israeli citizens” or a confession after being interrogated the night of his arrest.
In October, 27 members of Congress, including Florida Democratic U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor and Maxwell Frost, sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee expressing “grave concerns” over Ibrahim’s treatment, and called on them to press the Israeli government to release him.
Maryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen also signed that letter.
“I was relieved to hear from his family today and to know that he’s safe and where he belongs — with his family,” Van Hollen said on X on Thursday.
The letter noted that Ibrahim was the cousin of Sayfollah Mussalet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Tampa who was reportedly beaten to death by Israel settlers in July, with no one yet held in account regarding his killing.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0-4-1024x509.png,,,2025-11-28 14:57:19.368099

You can read more about the section here.

A few weeks ago in a conversation with a Mississippi legislator, I, as superintendent of the Oxford School District, was challenged to stop simply pushing back on school choice proposals and instead offer solutions.
The question was fair: If not school choice, then what? That challenge stayed with me, because I believe we can’t just oppose ideas. We must offer better ones. The truth is, there are smarter, more impactful choices we can make in education – choices that would transform Mississippi’s future without dismantling the public school system that serves the vast majority of our children.
As Mississippi continues to debate school choice, it’s time we ask a deeper question: What kind of choice actually creates opportunity for our children and moves our state forward?
For years, the conversation around education reform in Mississippi has centered on competition – where students go to school and which school gets the funding. But real improvement doesn’t come from competition. It comes from collaboration, consistency and a shared vision of success.

The truth is, Mississippi doesn’t need more schools to choose from. Instead, it needs more opportunities within the schools it already has.
Mississippi currently ranks among the lowest in the nation in labor-force participation, with barely half of working-age adults engaged in the workforce. It’s not that we lack jobs. It’s that too many Mississippians finish high school or even college without a clear path into meaningful work. As a result, we struggle to retain our own talent, fill high-wage jobs and sustain economic growth. 
If we want to strengthen our economy and our communities, we need to redefine what “choice” means. True educational choice shouldn’t be about choosing between public and private schools. It should be about creating more high-quality pathways within public education –  from the earliest years of a child’s life through the transition into adulthood. Instead of dividing our resources, let’s align them by investing in the full continuum of learning that starts in preschool and ends with a productive career.
The first and most transformative choice Mississippi can make is to invest in early childhood education for all families. Research consistently shows that the earliest years of life are the most critical for brain development.
During this time, children form the language, social and problem-solving skills that determine how they learn for the rest of their lives.
Yet in our state, access to high-quality early learning remains deeply unequal. Some communities are fortunate to have public or private preschool options, while others have long waiting lists or no programs at all. Many parents simply cannot afford tuition, leaving too many children behind before they even begin kindergarten. 
When children start school already behind, it can take years to close that gap. Many never do. We see this in literacy rates, in third-grade reading outcomes and later in high school graduation data. The gaps that emerge early in life become barriers to achievement, employment and self-sufficiency. The good news is that these gaps are preventable with a bold, statewide commitment to early learning. 
Universal access to early childhood education would be a game-changer for Mississippi. Children who attend strong preschool programs are more likely to read proficiently by third grade, graduate from high school and attend college or technical programs. They are also less likely to need special education services or repeat grades. The benefits ripple outward: Families gain stability, parents are more able to participate in the  workforce and communities thrive. 
High-quality early learning doesn’t just shape individual children. It strengthens the entire economy. When parents can rely on safe, affordable childcare, workforce participation increases. Businesses benefit from a more reliable labor supply.
Over time, the return on investment is remarkable. For every dollar spent on early childhood education, economists estimate a return of seven to 10 dollars in reduced costs for remediation, welfare and incarceration, and increased earnings and tax revenue. 
Imagine what it would mean for Mississippi if every 3- and 4-year-old had access to a strong early learning environment – one that emphasizes language development, curiosity and relationships with caring adults. Imagine what it would mean if every parent could go to work knowing their child was learning in a safe, enriching setting. Imagine what it would mean if kindergarten teachers welcomed classes of students who were all ready to learn, not already behind. 
The states that lead the nation in education and workforce development have already made this investment. It’s time Mississippi does the same. If we truly want to transform our schools. our economy and our future, it must start with the youngest learners.
The second critical choice Mississippi must make is to build a modern system of educational pathways that extend from high school into college, career and beyond. 
Around the world, countries that have aligned education and workforce systems are preparing students not only to graduate, but to thrive.
In one nation, nearly two-thirds of students participate in paid apprenticeships that blend classroom learning with real world experience. In another, students begin exploring careers in middle school and progress through flexible learning tracks that connect seamlessly to college or technical training. In a third, every student graduates with credentials recognized by both employers and universities, ensuring that no one’s future is limited by a single choice at age 16 or 18. 
These systems treat education as a shared responsibility between schools, employers and government. They prioritize flexibility, allowing students to shift between academic and applied learning. And they value all forms of success equally – whether a student earns a university degree, completes an apprenticeship or starts a business. 
Mississippi can design its own version of this model. Imagine a state where every student has access to three respected pathways: 
• A college-ready pathway for those pursuing four-year degrees. 
• An applied-learning pathway that combines academics with paid, hands-on work experiences leading to a certification or associate degree. 
• A direct-to-career pathway that connects students to high-wage industries like health care, advanced manufacturing or information technology. 
Each of these routes would be flexible and interconnected, allowing students to move between them as their goals evolve. Every pathway would be designed in partnership with local employers to ensure students graduate with both knowledge and experience. And every pathway would be valued equally with no stigma and no hierarchy – just options that recognize that success comes in many forms. 
This approach is already working in parts of Mississippi. Districts that have developed strong career academies or early college programs are seeing higher graduation rates, better attendance and stronger engagement. Scaling this across the state would require a coordinated effort among K-12 districts, community colleges, universities and industry, but it’s possible. In fact, it’s essential.
Both of these investments – early childhood education and career pathways – represent the smarter kind of school choice Mississippi needs. They focus not on competition but on capacity. They don’t pit schools against each other. They unite them around the shared goals of preparing every child to contribute to their community and reach their full potential. 
If Mississippi is serious about improving its economy, reducing poverty and retaining  homegrown talent, these are the choices that matter most.
Let’s choose to invest early, ensuring every child begins school ready to learn. Let’s choose to build pathways that prepare every graduate for college, career and life. Let’s choose collaboration over  competition, opportunity over ideology and a future where every Mississippi child has a path to success from cradle to career. 
That’s the kind of “school choice” worth fighting for – one that truly changes lives.

Many of the state’s fishing spots are open in the winter, though specific regulations on what can be taken when, what bait can be used and which places have seasonal closures is always something to bear in mind. 
Checking both ice conditions and Montana’s 2025-26 fishing regulations is a good idea before getting out on the ice. FWP suggests fishing during the day when fish are most active, and that people might have some luck around dams. Fish change their behavior in the winter, often moving to areas with less temperature variance. They also tend to slow down and look for areas that are more oxygenated.
“The most popular winter fly fishing rivers are typically tailwaters – those stretches below a dam,” Adam Strainer, who heads FWP’s fisheries division, said in a release.
The agency recommends never to ice fish alone, wear an extra layer under waders, consider using a wading staff and to avoid flowing water above your knees.
Ice should be at least 4 to 6 inches deep, avoid open water and keep a sharp eye out for holes left by other people. Spreading out in larger groups is also generally recommended.
Ice fishing can be dangerous, especially when it comes to burns — a 2016 National Institute of Health study found that about 38% of fishing injuries happen in January. However, the study found that thermal injuries are actually more common than hypothermia.
Alcohol was also mentioned in the study.
“Intoxication was reported twice as often in the narrative of ice-fishing injuries compared to traditional fishing injuries warranting further investigation,” the study reads.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-11.06.12-AM.png,,,2025-11-28 13:56:54.094944

The federal funding for LIHEAP, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes, has been held up during the beginning of the cold-weather season because of the federal government shutdown, which ended Nov. 12.
“This release of LIHEAP funding is essential and long overdue,” Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement. “Families can finally begin receiving the support they need to keep the heat on as winter begins.”
States typically receive their allocations at the beginning of November.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, has not yet issued a formal public announcement about resumption of the funding. After the federal shutdown ended, HHS said one of its agencies would “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” blaming the delay on congressional Democrats.
Wolfe said state agencies told his organization they’ve received award letters from HHS, enabling them to begin distributing assistance to households.
A message was left seeking comment with HHS.
On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. House members sent a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to release the LIHEAP funds by Nov. 30. Given the heating season has already started in many parts of the U.S., they said “there is no time to waste,” especially for households that use home heating oil or propane. Those fuels typically aren’t affected by state moratoriums on utility shutoffs during the winter months.
Roughly 68% of LIHEAP households also receive SNAP food benefits. Wolfe said delays in both programs during the shutdown “put many households in an even more precarious situation than usual.” While Friday’s funding release is welcome news, he said the need for assistance “remains enormous,” especially given rising energy prices. He noted that arrearages remain near record highs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25301782677114-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 13:56:54.094944

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Des Moines Area Community College President Rob Denson prepares to step away from the role — and the campus community he’s spent more than two decades serving — he said he’s working to make sure the college, ongoing projects and its new leaders are in the best place they can be.
After 22 years leading DMACC and more than 40 years in higher education, Denson will retire at the end of the year, with interim president Liang Chee Wee set to take over until a permanent president is found. Looking back on his career at the community college, Denson said he has no regrets.
“We’ve got a great organization. We’ve got enough facilities to handle everybody in central Iowa or be available to everybody in central Iowa. I think the operation is pretty good. We’ve got a very strong team, a leadership team that’s passionate about what they do,” Denson said. “But other than that, you know, I think I’m going to feel like I’ve done enough.”

A couple of capital projects currently in progress are still itching at him, however, namely new construction for the dental hygiene and assistance programs and industrial trade facilities. Construction crews have already broken ground on both of the projects, Denson said, but he was hoping to see at least $2 million raised by the college for both projects before he retires.
The community college foundation’s lack of an executive director has slowed fundraising, he said, and a search to fill the position didn’t see success. With Denson’s retirement coming up, he said the plan was to wait until a new president is in office to start the search up again. But with the presidential search itself delayed due to candidates withdrawing, he’s now spoken with Wee about trying to hire for the job instead of holding back.
“Since we’re not going to a permanent president probably till next June or July, we’re going to go ahead and fill that position, because I want to get that person up and running as far as raising that money,” Denson said.
In his time as president, Denson said he’s seen new technologies change the direction of higher education, from cell phones to artificial intelligence. DMACC is already offering both noncredit and credit courses in AI and related technologies, having been the first college in Iowa to partner with Intel to create curriculum and resources on the subject.
Employers Denson has spoken to in his role as president have said they’re looking for hires with skills and competency in AI tools. Denson predicted that AI training will be incorporated into “every program going forward,” whether that’s at community colleges, four-year universities or training offered directly by companies.
“I think the technology that we have and the ability to support students is really exciting, and this means that we can help them get through easier,” Denson said. “And there is so much support in Iowa.”
A more recent sign of change Denson said he’s not quite so hopeful about is the possibility of community colleges offering four-year degrees, something the association Community Colleges for Iowa explored at the prompting of Iowa lawmakers.
Community colleges already have amazing partnerships with Iowa’s four-year institutions, Denson said, and there aren’t any crises of capacity causing the need for such a shift in programming. When he worked in higher education in Florida, Denson said something similar occurred, but that was because universities simply didn’t have the room for all of the students.
“I think the Legislature is pretty smart, and I think they’ll work with the four-year institutions, and with us, and if there’s a gap there somewhere that we can fill, we’re happy to do that,” Denson said. “We do it all the time, but a blanket bachelor degree authority is probably not something that I would be excited about.”
Nearly two years after breaking the record to become DMACC’s longest-serving president, Denson’s favorite part about his job has now become the thing he will miss the most — graduation.
Seeing all of the students and families come out to celebrate such an important milestone as graduation, especially as more than one-third of DMACC students are low-income and more than half are first-generation, has been the highlight of his career, Denson said. He’ll miss the students, as well as the faculty, staff and leadership he has worked with for so long.
“Then again, you know, I’m not going to be lonely,” Denson said. “I’ve got plenty to do.”

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Detroit Lions tight end Sam LaPorta and his wife, Callie LaPorta, sent a letter earlier this month to state legislators in support of “Queenie’s Law,” a bill that seeks to ban all experimentation on dogs in Michigan public institutions. 
The bill was introduced in the state Senate by Sen. Paul Wojno (D-Warren) and in the House by Rep. Joe Aragona (R-Clinton Twp.) in March. The legislation sits in committee in both chambers, though in late October it moved out of the House Committee on Regulatory Reform to the House Committee on Rules.
“Dogs used in labs are no different than our incredible rescue pup Bonnie,” the letter from the LaPortas states, quoted in a press release circulated by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.
The group added that the couple is thankful that science is moving away from dog experimentation.
The letter urged House Speaker Matt Hall and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks to prioritize and advance the legislation, which is named after a dog that died after being used in experiments at Wayne State University. 
“Michigan’s dogs are lucky to have Sam and Callie on their side,” said Ryan Merkley, director of research advocacy for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which worked with the LaPortas on the letter. “Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill for painful, dead-end dog experiments.”
Other celebrities have also expressed support for the legislation, including actors Lily Tomlin and Ernie Hudson, who appeared in a TV ad in support of the bill.

Carnegie Mellon University annually attracts thousands of students from more than 150 nations with its highly ranked degree programs and abundant research opportunities. But this year, amid geopolitical tensions and tightening federal immigration policy, those numbers edged down.
Compared to last fall, there are currently 223 fewer students enrolled from China and 272 fewer students from India, for instance. That’s a dip of 7% and 15% respectively. A spokesperson for CMU acknowledged that international enrollment is “down in undergraduate and graduate programs,” but said that this decline is “smaller than that experienced by many other institutions.”

In 2020, U.S. universities experienced a steep drop in international enrollment as COVID-19 swept the globe, but numbers quickly rebounded. Now, international enrollment is facing new pressure from a changing U.S. immigration system.
Some U.S. policymakers are concerned about the perceived threat of international students, particularly Chinese students in STEM fields. And increasingly feverish language on the strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China — some of which has been heard on CMU’s campus this year — could also dent future international enrollment.
“I have international grad students who are scared and freaked out right now, and don’t feel welcome in this country,” said Carrie McDonough, a professor of chemistry at CMU.

In the 2023-2024 academic year, U.S. universities enrolled more than 1.1 million foreign students. While nationwide enrollment figures for the 2025-26 academic year are not yet available, other metrics are.
For instance, data from the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office show that 19% fewer international students entered the U.S. in August 2025 than during the same month last year. In Pennsylvania, the number of visas issued to Chinese and Indian students has dropped by 6% and 4% respectively, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) database.

Restrictions on international students could also hinder U.S. innovation, as CMU President Farnam Jahanian noted at a July AI summit on the campus. He said then that “we … need to have an immigration policy that allows us to recruit the best and the brightest to come to this country,” and pointed to data indicating that 90% of CMU’s international .”
 The China scare and visa insecurity

Contrary to Jahanian’s recommendations, many U.S. policymakers are seeking to limit international enrollment due to security and economic concerns.
On March 19, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent a letter to CMU and five other universities urging them to curtail their enrollment of Chinese students due to a fear of espionage and the subsequent loss of U.S. technological supremacy. “As China aggressively pursues dominance in strategic industries, the unchecked enrollment of Chinese nationals in American institutions risks facilitating the technological transfers that strengthen Beijing’s military and economic competitiveness at our nation’s expense,” the letter said.
In late March, the State Department followed up by revoking hundreds of student visas across the country, sometimes without warning, claiming the recipients were suspected of taking part in “activities that are counter … to our national interest.” Then in May, visa interviews were paused for three weeks to expand the vetting process, limiting the number of foreign students who could be admitted this semester.

According to McDonough, once the U.S. government showed its willingness to swiftly revoke visas, many international students stopped voicing their political beliefs around campus. “A lot of people feel really scared about saying anything that might be construed as un-American.”
For many, a student visa is the first step toward permanent residence. Research by the National Science Foundation shows that 73% of foreign PhD recipients who study science or engineering in the U.S. remain after graduation, while, according to a separate study by the Economic Innovation Group, only 17% of bachelor’s recipients stay.
 ‘There’s really no incentive to coming here’

CMU has not been spared from visa revocations.
On April 7, Jahanian notified students and faculty that “two current CMU students and five recent graduates had lost their visa status.” The students were given no reason for the revocations, although one who came forward with their story suggested it could be related to an expunged DUI case from 2023.
Six of the seven individuals soon had their visa status restored, but the move sent a chill through the international community. In the words of a Chinese-born graduate student who spoke with Public Source but asked to remain anonymous, the message was: “America don’t welcome you, you can come here to study, but be prepared to leave sooner or later.”
For those seeking longer-term U.S. residence through a work visa, the outlook is no more promising. In September, the administration introduced a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa, likely limiting the number of foreign workers that U.S. companies are able to hire. Public Source spoke with two Chinese graduate students at CMU who expressed that their plans to work in the U.S. after graduation may be thwarted by this new fee.
“I think we are at the peace before the storm,” one said. “What is now in contention is the policy position, the idea that America is a country that welcomes foreign talent.”
Korawich Kavee, a Thailand native and PhD student in CMU’s College of Engineering said even highly ranked American schools could struggle to attract foreign students like him if the U.S. keeps to its current path.

“Basic safety concerns, how is it going to work in terms of the visa, or in general the cost of living” are likely to make the U.S. less appealing for prospective students in Asia. “People can go to Canada, people can go to the UK, people can go to Australia,” he pointed out.
This changing visa policy doesn’t pose an immediate problem for Kavee, who will return to Thailand after graduation, but it does have “a strong impact on those who are thinking of coming to the U.S.,” he said.
A decline in international students could hit CMU hard. According to a dashboard maintained by the university, roughly 40% of CMU students and 14% of faculty have been foreign born since it began collecting data in 2021. The school’s primacy in fields like computer science and AI rely heavily on its ability to attract, as Jahanian put it, the “best and brightest.”
 ‘Our war with the communist Chinese’

On July 15, CMU took center stage as host to U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Energy and Innovation Summit. The event brought together leaders of industry, academia and government to discuss the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence.
McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, took the opportunity to announce that $90 billion of investments will come to the state to develop AI data centers powered by natural gas. He promised that “tens of thousands of jobs” will come to Pennsylvania if the region embraces the “AI revolution.”
Many speakers, though, raised concerns about a looming AI race with China, framing it as a matter of national security.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said that “losing the AI arms race” was one of the “existential threats” facing the United States. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright compared the current situation to World War II, claiming that “AI is our second Manhattan Project.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei spoke about the ability of AI “to find the needle in a haystack, the next September 11 … The better our AI can be, the better we will be able to contend with what our adversaries are able to do.”

Throughout the discussion of threats and adversaries, China was repeatedly singled out as the primary concern.
“If the United States does not lead this revolution on our own terms we will hand control of our infrastructure, our data, our leadership and our way of life to the Chinese Communist Party,” said McCormick. Gov. Josh Shapiro echoed this sentiment. “We do not want China to beat us in the AI race.”
Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick alleged that opposition to the AI revolution based on environmental concerns may be the result of Chinese manipulation. “The number one investor in the environmental narrative is China,” he claimed. “China … is trying to get us to close a coal plant a week.”
Some speakers were even more hawkish.
Rick Perry, former secretary of energy and former governor of Texas, praised President Donald Trump for acknowledging the “war that we’re in, and our war with the communist Chinese. That’s what this is all about, don’t get confused.”
Some experts on U.S.-China relations caution against such a blanket assumption of hostility.
“I worry about the feedback loop of fear and escalation, which I think can quickly spiral out of control,” said Kyle Chan, a researcher on industrial policy for the RAND institute and a post-doctoral researcher at Princeton University, in an interview with Public Source. Chan is currently writing a book about China’s tech-industrial policy. “I think words matter here a lot.”
He expressed hope for a more productive technological competition between the two nations, particularly in the field of AI, but he points out that “uncertainty over visa and immigration policies, and targeted attacks on some of the country’s most prestigious universities have sent a chill among foreign researchers in the U.S.”

Illah Nourbakhsh, a robotics professor at CMU and executive director of the Pittsburgh-based Center for Shared Prosperity, pointed out how a political environment that fails to welcome foreign talent may also hinder innovation. “The foreign and national students in our country are all outstanding. If we fail to encourage one group to innovate here, then we lose the chance of their innovations here.”
Nourbakhsh said the current climate reminds him of the first Trump administration, when “we started seeing more and more of our excellent students think about, ‘Should I set up that startup company here? Get a job at a university here? Or should I go to Europe? Or should I go back to a developing country where I come from perhaps, where the opportunities are sparser but I know I’ll be welcome?’”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Days after a shooting that left one member of the West Virginia National Guard dead and another hospitalized in Washington, D.C., U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she believes troops from West Virginia should remain in the city only on a voluntary basis.
Capito’s statement to reporters came after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard members be sent to the city in the wake of the shooting on Wednesday. About 150 members of the West Virginia National Guard are still in D.C., and have been deployed there on a voluntary basis since about Nov. 15.
“I like that idea — for West Virginians to be in a voluntary status. We’ve certainly served our time over in DC,” Capito said. “… I don’t know where [Trump] is going to draw his 500 extra guardsmen from. I think West Virginia should stay on a voluntary basis, and that will be up to the governor.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Morrisey originally sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. in August, at the request of the Trump administration.
Trump’s order to increase military presence in D.C. came after two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot in a targeted attack blocks from the White House on Wednesday. 
U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Summersville, W.Va. , died on Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025, after she was shot while on mission as a member of the West Virginia National Guard in Washington, D.C. (Photo courtesy of Joint Task Force-District of Columbia)
West Virginia National Guard member U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died on Thursday evening, according to officials. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained hospitalized in critical condition on Friday morning, according to a news release from Morrisey’s office.
In an interview with CNN’s Sarah Sidner on Friday morning, Morrisey said he was “supportive” of keeping West Virginia National Guard members who volunteer in D.C. He did not indicate whether more troops would be sent from the state, but said he agreed with Trump’s move to bring more military into the U.S. Capital. It would be wrong, he continued, to pull the National Guard out after the recent attack.
“The last thing in the world we should do is turn around and reverse course and let the bad guys, the evil-doers win,” Morrisey said. “… We cannot turn around and give in to them. We have to send a clear message that if you’re going to mess with our troops, you’re going to pay the price.”
The suspect was shot during the incident and taken into custody. On Thursday, federal law enforcement officials searched the home of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan refugee who worked with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Lakanwal allegedly drove across the country from Washington state to D.C. to target the troops, officials said.
Lakanwal is currently facing a murder charge as well as three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. 
In the wake of the shooting, Trump and other federal officials have vowed to crackdown on immigration. On Wednesday evening, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that all applications from Afghan nationals were being put on pause.
On Friday, Capito said she was “concerned” about the immigration process and the policies that allowed Lakanwal to come to the United States.
“I mean, what kind of vetting processes do we have? Are they thorough?” Capito questioned. “… I think that this is a sad way to point out that we don’t have good and accurate information [on our different immigration processes] that we need to get. We need to get more granular. I think that’s why the President put a halt on a lot of this, so that we can evaluate our processes.”

Pictured here is a deer in Ashworth Park in Des Moines on March 10, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is seeking feedback on its 25-year wildlife action plan, which must be reviewed every 10 years per federal law. 
The action plan, according to DNR, is a strategy for how the department will conserve wildlife in the state. It was last updated and reviewed in 2015, but was initially approved in 2006. 
A draft version of the 2025 update to the plan is available for review on the DNR’s website and public comments will be accepted on the plan through Dec. 5. 
The wildlife plan includes an overview of wildlife and conservation in the state, species of greatest concern, research, conservation priorities, a cost-benefit analysis and more. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The 2025 draft chapters have updates of wildlife statistics. For example, public conservation lands accounted for 1.7% of land area in the state in 2004, 2.48% in 2015 and 2.5% this year. 
The new version also updates the species of greatest conservation need in Iowa. Subcommittees of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan working group evaluated 1,601 species and determined there were 799 species of greatest conservation need. The 2025 list included bumble bees, moths and plants that were previously not considered. 
The initial plan outlined six “vision elements,” with a goal of Iowa recognizing these visions at the end of the 25-year plan, or in 2030. 
The 2025 draft version includes “implementation highlights” of the six vision elements. Listed below are the six vision elements, followed by DNR’s interpretation of how the visions have been implemented over the past 20 years. 
The visions express hope that by 2030, Iowa will have: 
“Viable wildlife populations” that are “compatible” with modern landscapes and human tolerance. 
Inventories and monitoring programs in the state show that some species, like the Olympia marble butterfly and the starhead topminnow were spotted in Iowa after decades of absence. Some reintroduction programs for species like peregrine falcons, trumpeter swans and osprey, have been “highly successful” in the state, as have citizen scientist monitoring programs. 


Comments on the plan maybe submitted: 
via email to Katy.Fullin@dnr.iowa.gov
or by mail to Katy Fullin,
Iowa DNR, 6200 Park Ave., Ste 200, Des Moines, IA 50321.
Comments are due by Dec. 5, 2025.


“Healthy ecosystems” incorporating “diverse, native” habitats that can sustain wildlife populations.
The state has improved bird conservation areas, led stream restoration projects for freshwater mussels, “enhanced and expanded” native prairies for butterflies and mapped species of greatest conservation need.
Communities that are developed with “adaptive ecological management principles.” 
The department employs land management plans that try to “recreate prairie ecosystems” which once comprised more than 80% of Iowa’s landscape. The chapter said restoring native ecosystems for specific species is difficult with “much of the landscape being used for agriculture.” The department also works to maintain the native landscapes by controlling invasive species.  
More Iowans who participate in “wildlife-associated recreation.” 
DNR continues to expand wildlife-associated recreation opportunities by maintaining access to public land and other programming, including a recent effort to engage birding communities in the state. 
Iowans who respect wildlife and advocate for the conservation of wildlife and habitats.
DNR works to provide outdoor recreation opportunities for Iowans. Part of this includes the department’s online atlases for public and private hunting lands.
“Stable, permanent funding” for the management of wildlife, at a level “adequate to achieve the visions” laid out in the plan. 
The chapter said “funding has never been dedicated to wildlife conservation at a level adequate to achieve plan goals,” but partnerships, like the DNR license plates and the Chickadee Checkoff  have enabled some larger-scale projects. 
The 2025 draft also calls for a marketing campaign to persuade Iowans, lawmakers and other leaders to fund the plan. 
According to the cost-benefit analysis included in the plan, implementation of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan would cost about $165 million annually. This funding would allow the department to increase the amount of permanently protected acres in Iowa to 4% and continue habitat protection, management, survey and research activities.
Under that estimate, annual funding is $127 million short, according to the 2025 draft plan. 
The latest version of the plan said the original action plan, with its goal of permanent protection for 4% of Iowa’s land, required an annual rate – via conservation easements and land acquisitions – of 31,600 acres per year. The actual rate has been between 8,350 to 13,934 acres annually. If the current rate of land protection continues, the 4% goal would be achievable in 2055, but not 2030. 
The plan said the cost of land and “varied” federal funding, has impacted the state’s ability to protect land. 
2023 figures included in the 2025 draft of the plan found the outdoor recreation sector had more than $2.19 billion in wages over 46,000 jobs. Outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, target shooting and wildlife watching contributed nearly $2 billion in economic development in 2024. 
The draft plan said the “conclusion is clear” that conservation is a “solid investment for Iowa.”
“As implementation of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan continues, more benefits will be seen across the state for wildlife as well as for the people who enjoy outdoor recreation and who value wildlife and wild spaces,” the 2025 draft said.

Read this story in English.
La legislatura de Connecticut modificó recientemente las leyes que rigen la interacción de los funcionarios locales y estatales con los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de EE. UU. (ICE) y limita las actividades de los agentes de ICE en el estado. Las modificaciones a la ley estatal se realizaron en respuesta a las preocupaciones de los residentes sobre la política federal de inmigración. Divididos por partidos, los Demócratas estatales han trabajado para abordar las afirmaciones de los inmigrantes de que viven con miedo.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las actividades de ICE en Connecticut.
¿Qué cambios se implementaron en la última legislación estatal?
En la sesión especial de noviembre, los legisladores estatales aprobaron el Proyecto de Ley 8004 de la Cámara de Representantes, que incluye secciones que limitan la capacidad de ICE para realizar arrestos en los juzgados. El proyecto de ley prohíbe a los representantes de las autoridades policiales locales, estatales o federales arrestar a personas dentro de los juzgados estatales sin una orden judicial. Los agentes de ICE tampoco pueden usar mascarillas en los juzgados sin un requisito médico.
También existen medidas para proteger la información personal de los inmigrantes. Las agencias estatales no pueden compartir información personal como fechas y horas de audiencias y citas judiciales, domicilios particulares y lugares de trabajo.
El Gobernador Ned Lamont promulgó el proyecto de ley poco después del período extraordinario de sesiones.
¿Pueden las fuerzas del orden de Connecticut entregar inmigrantes al ICE?
En 2019, los legisladores de Connecticut aprobaron la Ley de Confianza, que especificaba los motivos por los cuales los funcionarios locales y estatales podían entregar inmigrantes no autorizados al ICE. La ley prohíbe a las fuerzas del orden estatales arrestar a personas únicamente con base en órdenes de detención (solicitudes del ICE para retener a alguien hasta por 48 horas para que los agentes puedan detenerlo).
Los agentes del orden solo pueden cumplir con las órdenes de detención si el ICE cuenta con una orden judicial para realizar un arresto, o si la persona bajo su custodia ha sido condenada por un delito grave de clase A o B, o está identificada en una lista de vigilancia terrorista. Los delitos graves de clase A o B incluyen asesinato, secuestro, agresión sexual, robo y homicidio en primer grado.
La Ley de Confianza se modificó en mayo de este año. Ahora, las personas pueden demandar a las ciudades y pueblos si se viola la ley. Además, se ampliaron las circunstancias bajo las cuales las fuerzas del orden deben cumplir con las solicitudes de detención del ICE para incluir 13 delitos más y definir quiénes se consideran agentes del orden.
¿Qué sucede cuando el ICE realiza un arresto?
Si bien las leyes recientes buscaban hacer que los juzgados sean más seguros para los inmigrantes en Connecticut, los agentes del ICE aún pueden realizar arrestos en otros lugares públicos sin orden judicial si tienen una sospecha razonable de que la persona a la que se dirigen es un migrante no autorizado, según la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad.
Además, fuera de los juzgados, no existen leyes que exijan a los agentes del ICE mostrar su rostro ni que prohíban el uso de mascarillas. Esto significa que los agentes del ICE aún pueden acercarse a una persona con mascarilla y realizar un arresto sin orden judicial.
¿Cómo recomienda el estado que las agencias estatales respondan a las visitas del ICE?
En un documento de la oficina de Lamont emitido en enero, el estado proporciona orientación sobre cómo las agencias estatales deben gestionar las visitas del ICE para cumplir con las leyes estatales y federales, a la vez que protegen el derecho a la privacidad de las personas.
La guía instruye a los funcionarios estatales a solicitar información sobre el motivo de la visita del agente de ICE, notificar a un asesor legal y abstenerse de compartir información personal o documentos, como su estatus migratorio, hasta que un asesor legal revise la solicitud.
ICE también tiene acceso limitado a áreas no públicas. Tienen prohibido acceder a áreas no públicas de un edificio de una agencia estatal sin una orden judicial. Sin embargo, no existe legislación que limite sus movimientos en las instalaciones públicas de un establecimiento. Por ejemplo, un agente de ICE podría realizar un arresto injustificado en una acera fuera de la instalación estatal.

No coroner candidate crossed the 50% vote threshold to avoid a runoff. Jeramiah Howard, the current interim coroner, came close at 41% of the vote. He and Stephanie Meachum, who received 16.7% of the vote, are vying for the position. 
The winner will complete the term of Sharon Grisham-Stewart, who served as county coroner from January 1999 until December 2024. She still had a year left in her term.
In Grisham-Stewart’s final years as coroner, her office along with Jackson Police Department were scrutinized for not adequately notifying families of missing persons about their loved one’s burials at the county pauper field.
Howard and Meachum previously worked in the Hinds County Coroner’s Office under Grisham-Stewart’s leadership. She endorsed and campaigned for Howard.
The Hinds County Board of Supervisors appointed Howard as the acting coroner in January. He served as chief deputy coroner under Grisham-Stewart for five years. He also served as chief of the Pocahontas Volunteer Fire Department for 10 years.
Meachum served as office manager responsible for budgets and agency records for the coroner’s office from 2011 to 2016. She has led the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics office since 2016.
On Election Day, Howard won nearly every precinct from Utica to Jackson, only losing roughly 10 precincts out of 108. He won by his widest margins in Pocahontas and other northwestern precincts located in the county. Meachum performed best in central Jackson. 
Only 12.75% of 165,069 voters turned out for Election Day in Hinds County.
Howard has signs in most precincts in the county, in front of private homes and off interstates and highways. Some went up as early as July. He estimates that his team has placed 30 big signs, 100 medium signs and over 600 yard signs across the county.
“It was a team effort,” he said. “I feel blessed to have this much support across the county.”
He also wanted to thank his nearly thirty volunteers.
“Running for office is a noble deed,” he said. “My fellow candidates ran good races and deserve credit for putting their name on the ballot and reaching people in the community.”
Meachum has been her own campaign manager since she first filed. Her team sometimes included a few friends and family. Since the runoff announcement, she has received calls from potential volunteers.
“I feel inspired to reach more voters,” she said in an interview with Mississippi Today on Oct. 5. “Some are still unsure of what the coroner does, and I’m hoping to reach them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04160529/Voting-14.jpg,,,2025-11-28 12:57:16.166568

Concern about federal duties not being carried out effectively, concern for colleagues’ wellbeing, concern about how the reduction in the federal workforce will affect the economy, and concern about jobs being cut at any moment.


From insiders to ousted
This is the final story in a series about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


About 154,000 federal employees took buyouts — officially described as deferred resignations — early this year, providing them with pay through the end of the fiscal year in exchange for leaving their position. The Trump administration made the offers as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
During the recent federal government shutdown, an estimated 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, and another 730,000 were required to work without pay.
Excluding contractors and postal workers, there are 8,123 federal civilian employees living in South Dakota. When retirees are added, South Dakota’s “federal family” is just shy of 22,000, Zimmerman said. Just under 800 belong to his organization, which advocates for members, their pay and their benefits.
“The federal employee is there to serve the American public. We are here to help you,” Zimmerman said. “We’re not the enemy. We’re not the root of the problem. We’re just trying to do our job to take care of you.”
‘We’ve lost institutional knowledge’
Zimmerman worked for decades for the U.S. State Department as a security engineer. He was paid lower than what he would have received in the private sector, but he felt his role was noble. He felt called to serve his country even into retirement.
The 68-year-old participated in the State Department’s re-employed annuitant program after he retired in 2010, which allows retired foreign service or civil service workers to temporarily fill staffing gaps or work on special projects. Zimmerman, who lives in Sturgis, would often live in a country overseas for a few months to fill critical roles.
Zimmerman retired completely in October 2024, and has since heard from former colleagues about Department of Government Efficiency cuts. A Trump executive order in February directed agency heads to “separate from Federal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject” to reductions in force.
A drastic reduction in the workforce means there aren’t enough people to do necessary work, which requires cutting back programs, Zimmerman said. He thinks cutting back the State Department’s re-employed annuitant program makes the problem worse and will jeopardize national security.
“I’ve seen programs cut that I don’t think they’ve thought through the impact of those cuts,” Zimmerman said.
It’ll take years and significant costs to build back the federal government, even to verify and reanalyze the need of programs, let alone hire people back, Zimmerman said. Many federal jobs require a specialized skillset.
“We’ve lost institutional knowledge,” Zimmerman said, “and that costs a lot of money and time to rebuild it back to where we need it to be.”

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/28/judges-ruling-public-bodies/,Public bodies too often use exemptions in the Open Public Meetings Act to exclude the public from matters that concern them.,"The Monroe Township Board of Education meets on Oct. 15, 2025. The board was sued over its decision to appoint a new member before holding a public discussion.A panel of appellate judges this week shined a spotlight on the all-too-common issue of government bodies in New Jersey hashing out decisions behind closed doors.
If you’ve ever watched a public meeting, you know what I’m talking about. Officials tell the public they have legal matters to discuss, so they meet privately, sometimes for hours. The state Open Public Meetings Act allows them to do this, with limits, but any reporter or gadfly will tell you they suspect a lot more goes on during these private sessions than the law allows.
The appellate decision from this week involves the Monroe Township Board of Education, which met on Oct. 18, 2023, in part to fill a vacant seat on the nine-member board. It met in closed session for 45 minutes to discuss the candidates, reached a consensus pick while meeting privately, then returned to public session to appoint a guy named Matthew Gorham, without giving the public a chance to weigh in before their vote to add him to the board. That was a violation of the Open Public Meetings Act, the appellate court ruled.
“Substantively, the public only witnessed the nomination and vote to install Gorham. The Board did not take any questions or comments from the public about the candidates or the process because it moved directly to the nomination and vote,” this week’s ruling says.
Making matters worse, the board had previously told the public they’d be interviewing candidates at the meeting, then decided not to.
The Open Public Meetings Act certainly gives the Monroe school board the legal right to discuss potential appointments to a vacant seat outside of public view. But the law also requires them to bring that discussion back before the public before acting, as the new ruling says.
“The fact (that) all its deliberations regarding candidate qualifications and whether to interview those candidates took place in private, without giving the public any insight into these decisions, was problematic,” it says.
Walter Luers, who represented the plaintiff in her lawsuit against the Monroe board, said he’s pleased the appellate panel issued an “important rule of law” stating that school boards, when appointing a new member, must explain the decisions they make behind closed doors to the public.
“This is an important rule for transparency and Board governance in New Jersey, and is consistent with existing New Jersey caselaw,” Luers said.
The fight over the Monroe school board appointment is largely moot — Gorham lost in his bid to stay in the seat in April 2024 — but I hope other public entities take note here. State law governs when you can and can’t meet in private, and simply saying “we’ve got legal matters to discuss” isn’t a good enough reason to shut the public out of matters of public concern. Luers agrees. 
“I hope it moves the needle closer to public entities having more disclosures and discussions in public, and certainly when appointing an official that ordinarily the electorate votes for, a higher standard applies,” Luers said.

Free.,National Guard shooting suspect to face murder charge,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-guard-shooting-suspect-face-murder-charge,,"The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia announced Friday it has charged the man who allegedly shot two National Guard members earlier this week with first-degree murder after one of the soldiers died as a result of her injuries. Other charges include three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. The attack shocked the country and has led to a renewed discussion about immigration policy as well as the war in Afghanistan and how the country withdrew during the Biden administration. President Donald Trump announced late Thursday night he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” though he didn’t specify which countries would be included or exactly how such an order would be implemented. Trump wrote on social media he plans to ""remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.""The post came just hours after U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from injuries she sustained during a Wednesday shooting a couple of blocks from the White House. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained hospitalized in critical condition. Both were West Virginia National Guard members.The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who worked with United States forces, entered the country on Sept. 8, 2021, as part of Operation Allies Welcome, according to a statement from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.No details of immigration proposalsThe White House press office declined to say Friday which countries would have their residents barred from entering the United States under the new order, referring back to the president’s social media posts, which did not include a list.“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump wrote. “Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!”Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a Thursday afternoon statement the administration would pause immigration applications for Afghan nationals.“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” she wrote. The Trump administration will also review “all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration,” McLaughlin said, saying those cases required more vetting. Biden Afghanistan policy blamedIn a separate post, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden for allowing the alleged shooter into the country. McLaughlin echoed that sentiment.Lakanwal “was paroled in by the Biden Administration. After that, Biden signed into law that parole program, and then entered into the 2023 Ahmed Court Settlement, which bound (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) to adjudicate his asylum claim on an expedited basis. Regardless if his asylum was granted or not, this monster would not have been removed because of his parole.” The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, following two decades of war that began as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, has been widely criticized.Many of the Afghan nationals who aided the United States and allied countries were left behind as the Taliban quickly regained control. Motive unknownLakanwal had been residing in Washington state and drove across the country before the shooting, according to Jeanine Pirro, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.Officials investigating the shooting have yet to release a possible motive.Lakanwal was granted asylum in the U.S. in April, according to reporting by many media outlets, including NPR.The Department of Homeland Security did not confirm for States Newsroom the date Lakanwal was granted asylum.",,,,2025-11-28 11:57:32.391845

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Paul Lasley’s hobby of restoring old and broken violins and donating them to Iowa State University’s instrument collection program didn’t start with a violin of his own, or really any other stringed instrument — it started with a tin clarinet.
When the retired ISU sociology professor was growing up in Queen City, Mo., he wanted to join his elementary school band. Lasley said his family couldn’t afford a new, black-painted wood clarinet, so he had to borrow an older, metal instrument from the school.
Now he’s working to make sure students who hope to find belonging and opportunity through music like he did have better equipment than was available to him, through finding and fixing fiddles and giving them to an instrument drive run by Iowa State Center’s Stephens Auditorium staff.

“We’re enculturating the value of helping others, and that’s what we really should be about …,” Lasley said. “I was loaned a tin clarinet, and while I really would like to have had a better instrument, I had the opportunity.”
Instrument drive puts music in the hands of area students
Lasley has donated 15 violins to the instrument drive so far, he said, and he has more he’s currently repairing to donate. While he originally planned to be an anonymous gifter to the instrument cart that sits in the lobby of the auditorium ticket office, Lasley said his wife took a sneaky picture and posted it online.
The retired professor’s face would be recognizable to many on campus, as he worked at the university for 40 years. His creation of the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll provided a way to track agriculture and farm life, and how changes in these areas affect farmers and rural society, according to the poll’s website.
Lorna Carroll, outreach coordinator for Stephens Auditorium, and other staff got wind of Lasley’s identity and reached out to him. While Lasley said his first thought after answering Carroll’s call was “Uh-oh, what might I have done,” Carroll assured him they just wanted to connect with the generous donor.
What started as seasonal instrument drives in the winter and spring have turned into a year-round practice, Carroll said. Donations of working and non-working instruments — except pianos — may be dropped off at the collection cart when the ticket office is open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday.
Since the drive’s start in 2023, Carroll said 113 instruments have been donated, with Lasley having donated the most. The instruments go to area school bands and orchestras, where they are loaned to students.
“It’s super expensive to buy an instrument, and even to rent one,” Carroll said. “It’s out of reach for a lot of families, and so the school districts do what they can to provide what they can, repair what they can, but what a gift that (Lasley has) given.”
Making fiddles sing again
Lasley said he only repairs beginner and intermediate-level fiddles, as high-level instruments should be taken to professional repair workers.
“I am the equivalent of a shade tree mechanic with automobiles,” Lasley said. “I’m not a luthier, I’m a shade tree violin fixer upper.”

Violins are found in shops, flea markets and on Facebook Marketplace, and even in pieces they can be useful. An electric violin Lasley said he was unable to fix hangs as an art piece on his office/workshop door and instruments both in need of repair and all fixed up are on the walls, a bucket of old bows in the corner and cases not fit for use set against the wall.
Lasley buys new bows and cases for the instruments before they’re donated, he said, so students can have new materials that can take the beating often provided by young musicians.
Each violin has its own work that needs to be done, Lasley said, and no two violins are the same. They each have their own history, told through the dings and etchings on the wood that Lasley said he keeps if they have a particular meaning, like the “DMPS,” standing for Des Moines Public Schools, he found on a fiddle he’s already donated.
Lasley said his hobby was born from woodworking, a lifelong hobby he spent more time on after retiring. There are only so many pieces of furniture friends and family can accept before there isn’t any room for more, he said.

One violin he’s yet to start on has come apart, with the top completely separate from the back and evidence of previous repairs that need to be fixed. Lasley said he’ll start the project by scratching off old glue, patching cracks and gluing the top plate back on. Once the front has been reattached, Lasley will insert a soundpost that, once restrung, will be held in place by 55 pounds of pressure.
Before he restrings it, however, Lasley said he’ll have to shape a bridge and attach it to the face of the violin to hold the strings.
“You end up doing everything while eyeballing and measuring, and then I get frustrated. That’s when I come over here and practice,” Lasley said, gesturing to another corner of his office where a music stand is set up, sheet music laid out.
Playing on
Lasley started playing violin when he was 69 years old. Now 73, the retired professor said he mainly learns by listening to recordings of his teacher playing over and over until he’s got the tune in his head and can sing it out on the strings. He emphasized that while he — and his teacher — can both read sheet music, this is his preferred learning style.
Holding the violin owned by his great-grandfather, who died in 1922, Lasley wondered if the melodies he plays on it were made more than a century ago on the same instrument, 30 years before he was born.

Lasley was lucky, he said, to have grown up with music constantly in the background — guitar from his father, upright bass from his mother and a reed pump organ he remembers playing at 4 years old with his grandmother, who had to push the pedals since his feet couldn’t reach.
In addition to playing the clarinet, Lasley said he played the bass clarinet and saxophone in school and played upright bass in his own band for years.
As he continues to search for fiddles to make sing once again, with the goal of getting them in students’ hands, Lasley said he hopes they help to instill values of paying kindness and generosity forward.
“It’s about helping the next generation,” he said.

She lost her job in a restructure done by the national organization. (Screen capture of Child Welfare System Oversight Committee)TOPEKA — A national organization supporting social workers restructured, stripping Kansas of its local executive director and leaving a long-time system advocate without a job.
Becky Fast, who has led the Kansas chapter of the National Association of Social Workers since 2017, was let go from her position when NASW announced internally two weeks ago that it was combining 14 state chapters into pairs that would be overseen by one director.
Kansas now is paired with Iowa, said LaToya Evans, NASW spokeswoman.  
Fast was stunned by the decision to restructure the NASW’s entire system and said it was not discussed or voted on by member states or representatives. The decision was made at the executive committee level.
“The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is undergoing a national, internal realignment to strengthen operational efficiency and support for social workers,” Evans said in an email. “As costs within nonprofit organizations continue to increase, it has become necessary to continue transitioning to a dual-chapter executive director model in states that have fewer members or were supported by part-time employees.”
Fast, who is also a Johnson County commissioner, worked 30 hours per week as executive director, she said. 
Organization dues in Kansas pay for the local chapter costs, including her salary, so financial considerations are not the full reason for the restructuring, Fast said. In a letter announcing the new structure, the national board said “appropriate steps were taken to ensure that we adhered to our financial, legal, and ethical duties.”
Evans said Kansas and Iowa will each maintain a leadership council and chapter identities. The new model has been tested in some states, providing full-time employee support between neighboring chapters and maintaining local engagement and collaboration, she said.
Across the country, social workers and state NASW leaders took to social media to complain about the decision. In some states, including Arkansas and Kentucky, entire boards running state chapters resigned at once in disagreement with the national association’s decisions.
The Kansas NASW chapter board wrote a letter expressing its anger at how the restructuring decisions were made, citing the lack of clear communication, one of the bedrock principles of social work, as leaving board members and volunteers “confused and frustrated.”
“As the Kansas Chapter President, I have not been informed about the rationale, process, or decision-making steps leading to the elimination of our Kansas Director,” Kansas board president Tonya Ricklefs wrote in a letter signed by all board members.
The letter listed accomplishments Fast made as a state leader, including moving the organization out of a financial deficit and organizing one of the largest “advocacy day” efforts in the NASW organization. On social media, one upset Kansan pointed to Fast’s recent testimony in front of a Kansas legislative committee addressing questions about workforce issues.
“Frustrations have arisen from the lack of communication about realignment plans, no publication of approval of major changes, lack of opportunity for board and executive director input, and lack of understanding of how this cost savings will be allocated and how NASW will be structured to support our local advocacy efforts,” Ricklefs’ letter said.
Fast, the Kansas board of directors and others worry that eliminating the local chapter will weaken statewide advocacy efforts, particularly at a time when social workers are needed to support many industries.
“I’m not only sad that I’ve lost my job,” Fast said. “I’m sad for the social work community, the social workers, because it’s taken me years to build up (legislative) relationships.”
The lack of direct Kansas leadership raised such concerns that advocates have called a virtual meeting on Dec. 6 to discuss whether there is a way to create “a new Kansas social work organizational structure with the first priority being legislative advocacy,” one Facebook post said.
Fast said she’s worked with numerous Kansas legislators to educate them about social work, and the result is relationships built on trust so that government officials will call and ask for presentations and information.
The power of relationships was brought home to Fast recently when she filled in for her Oklahoma counterpart who was on sick leave. As she tried to work through issues, Fast said, she struggled with who to contact and even finding social workers in the state willing to testify. In Kansas, she has helped social workers become confident and willing to share their stories.
Fast said each state’s licensing laws are different and it’s important that the person speaking for Kansas social workers understands the nuances of the laws, particularly in a time when the Trump administration has proposed removing social workers from a list of professional degrees.
Melinda Lewis, a University of Kansas professor and director of the Center for Community Engagement and Collaboration, said the loss of someone with Fast’s knowledge of Kansas-specific challenges is significant.
“I do think the Kansas chapter of NASW with Becky’s leadership has made great strides in helping policymakers — not just legislators but state agencies and local leaders who pay attention to what’s happening in the Legislature — understand what social work does for Kansans,” Lewis said.
“We are in a different and a much more promising place now than we were several years ago, and (Kansas NASW) and Becky Fast aren’t the sole reason those advances have been made but they have been significant in it,” she added.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Becky-Fast-11-25-screen-capture-1024x536.png,,,2025-11-28 11:57:32.391845

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The State Library of Ohio got some good news as a federal agency from which they receive grant money won a battle in federal court against an executive order from President Donald Trump.
Last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island blocked Trump’s order that would have dismantled the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
The institute is the sole source of federal funding for libraries, according to Ohio’s State Librarian Mandy Knapp.
The State Library of Ohio receives funds through the institute’s Library Services and Technology Act for training, administration of grant programs, and to support sharing resources through a consortium for “significant cost-savings for taxpayers.”
“In our state, we use these funds to enhance summer reading so that our children don’t lag behind academically, to conserve our culture heritage to make sure that future generations will be able to share in our collective past, as well as to implement the latest research such as the Science of Reading in our libraries,” Knapp said in a statement.
The state librarian previously told the Capital Journal the loss of the federal funding would “totally and utterly devastate” the agency.

The most recent grants distributed by the state library from the $5.4 million received from the institute went to programs including monthly story times for the deaf, technology for use with historical records, and digital materials for the home-bound.
In addition, the Toledo Lucas County Public Library received a grant to support the Science of Reading, and 18 rural libraries received money for public technology training.
The struck-down executive order was issued March 14, ordering the elimination of the agency all together.
After the order, the Trump administration removed the board of the institute, terminated grants from the agency and planned mass layoffs.
The American Library Association said the actions left the institute “unable to fulfill its duties required by federal law and interrupted library services across the country.”
“Convincing a federal judge that shuttering a supposedly obscure agency would have an immediate and devastating impact on millions of Americans is no small feat,” said Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, after the order was struck down.
“Libraries also strengthen local economies by supporting jobseekers, small businesses and community learning.”
While the State Library of Ohio sees the court win as a positive sign, they are still struggling due to cuts the state made in its most recent operating budget.
While previous state budgets have had separate line items for the State Library of Ohio, in the most recent state operating budget, the method of distributing state funds for the agency is through a transfer from the Public Library Fund, a fund that previously was earmarked for local public libraries outside of the state agency.
The Public Library Fund is tasked with providing funds for the State Library of Ohio, the Library for the Blind, the Ohio Public Library Information Network, the Regional Library Systems Fund, and the Ohioana Library Association, according to budget documents.
The state funds the Public Library Fund using shares of the monthly General Revenue Fund tax receipts, to the tune of 1.75% of the revenue.
In the next two fiscal years, the state library is set to receive $4.5 million in each year.
State Librarian Knapp said when the changes were announced in budget drafts that the number amounts to a cut of $245,000 in 2026 and $331,000 in 2027 compared to previous drafts of the budget.
The cuts also came as Knapp laid out the situation at the state library, where staff and health insurance costs rose, and the library facility was “no longer suitable to house the State Library’s collection.”
The library holds historical documents like the state’s founding documents as part of their conservation role with the state.
A spokesperson from the state library said the entity has “evaluated the services (it) provides and determined where we should focus our resources.”
As a result, the library has had to cut some services like information technology support in meeting rooms, and left an Information Services & Technology Department position open after it was recently vacated.
The library plans to monitor the federal case in case it’s appealed to a higher court, and the upcoming federal budget resolution, which is set to expire on Jan. 30, 2026.

“Adult learners are balancing careers, families, and community commitments and they deserve an education model that works for them,” said Lee Noethe, senior director of LIFE admission – Dubuque, in the release. “The new LIFE HyFlex format empowers our students to take control of their education and advance their careers with the same quality, rigor, and personal attention UD is known for.”
Classrooms at both the Dubuque and Cedar Rapids locations are being updated to provide the best experience for students no matter their method of learning, the release stated, with the addition of cameras, microphones and other technology. This work is already complete in two Dubuque classrooms and one Cedar Rapids space.
“The upgraded program and lower tuition combine UD’s hallmark personal touch with the latest in educational technology,” Noethe said in the release. “We’ve created a model that meets students where they are, supports them every step of the way, and opens the door to meaningful credentials and careers.”

Ned Houston wore many hats during his 37 years on staff at Sterling College, from president of the tiny Craftsbury Common college to what he called, “lowly faculty member.”
Ned Houston and his wife, Susan, a former Craftsbury Selectboard member for 18 years, have lived in the small Northeast Kingdom town for decades. They’ve seen first hand the economic and cultural benefits that the environmentally focused school has had on Craftsbury since its founding in 1958.
The school, one of the smallest four-year colleges in the country, once attracted students from around the country to Craftsbury, a collection of small villages that includes Craftsbury Common.

Here, students and faculty did significant work, heading out to conduct field work in the Himalayas, and resource management projects along the Colorado River, not to mention their work in Vermont itself.
The college has helped define the economic and cultural life of the community, made up of born-and-raised Vermonters mixed with alums of the school who decided to stick around. The college, community members say, played a part in bucking Vermont’s longer-term demographic trends when, in the 2020 census, it saw its population actually increase.
“I think, despite our location in a very rural area, we gave quite a lot of world exposure to students, and to ourselves,” Ned Houston said.
But this month, after 65 years of operation, the school announced it would be ending its academic programming following the upcoming spring semester. College officials said the school faced persistent financial and enrollment challenges.
The news has spurred plenty of worry in the town of roughly 1,300. What does a future in Craftsbury without Sterling College look like?
“We had been a relative success story,” said Gina Campoli, a Craftsbury Common resident. “And now we’re getting hammered.”
The closure has also reinforced anxiety around the future of higher education in Vermont. Sterling College is just the latest in a string of transitions and closures at small colleges in Vermont and in New England.
More than a half dozen colleges in Vermont, including Green Mountain College in Poultney, the College of St. Joseph in Rutland and Goddard College in Plainfield, have shuttered after facing similar challenges around finances and enrollment.

“Sterling has always seemed to have this unique niche of people and has been able to survive some challenges in the past,” Campoli said. “And to have this reality hit us now, it’s very sad.”
Cultural impact
Emily McClure first purchased The Genny, Craftsbury’s local general store, with two other business partners in 2012. In the years after, McClure said Sterling College students have been a routine presence at the store — as customers, employees and community members.
Those students have for years had an indelible influence on the culture of the town, she said.
“There’s this young energy that comes with a college in your town,” McClure said. Craftsbury Common would not be what it is, she said, without Sterling College having been there for nearly 70 years.
Having a college in town brings academics and thinkers into the community to speak at events and “adds a great deal to I think that just the general depth of discussions of things here in the college,” Ned Houston said. The college has also served as a major employer for the region. 
Alums, too, are a big part of the community’s social fabric. Susan Houston said many graduates become ingrained in the community and settle down, working in the area, having children and sending them to the local K-12 public school, Craftsbury Academy.
“I think that that has really helped boost our population,” she said.
But McClure said the town and college’s populations have decreased since the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of students who remain in the community after they graduate has also dwindled, she said.

“It really has been this kind of slow decline in the presence of the college over the last five or so years,” she said. “Whereas I feel like, when I first got here, it just felt like it had a bigger presence.”
The college is set to officially shut its doors in the summer. “I’m sure we’re going to feel it, but I think we’re going to feel it more in an energetic way than we are financially,” McClure said.
Susan Houston, too, fretted over the longer-term impacts of the college’s closure, particularly on the population of alums.
“We won’t have new alums living in our community anymore, and that just makes me really tragically sad because I’ve so enjoyed knowing these students as anxious and excited 18-year-olds, and now they’re in their 30s and in their 40s, and I loved having them as community friends,” she said. “I think we’re going to really miss that.”

Water woes
The town’s civic infrastructure also could take a big hit when Sterling College closes.
Paula Davidson, the treasurer of the Craftsbury Fire District #2, a volunteer body that manages the local water system in Craftsbury Common, said the college has been key to the water district’s operations since the body was founded in 1983. The district serves residential homes, a church, libraries and the Craftsbury Academy.
Kestrel Owens, a commissioner of the water district, said the college’s closure will “have a major impact on our budget in terms of what sort of income we have to run the water system.”
The college has historically been the district’s largest customer, representing 45% of the district’s water usage and 36% of district’s customer income, Davidson said.
The district maintains water connection for Craftsbury Academy, which represents 12% of its income and serves approximately 180 students. The district also operates 40 other metered connections in Craftsbury Common, serving roughly 68 residents.

Without the college, “I’m not sure how we will proceed,” she said.
Davidson said the district expects to begin charging more in the coming years to build capital reserves. “We also hope to find grants and loans to help us afford the looming infrastructure repairs and replacements,” she said.
But she said the district “will be anxiously watching to see what happens with the Sterling College buildings.”
What happens next is unclear. Sterling College President Scott Thomas previously said the focus now is getting the remaining students through their last semester.
Thomas said the college’s board of trustees will determine how to steward the college’s remaining resources.
“I don’t know what’s next, but there will be resources remaining,” he said earlier this month. “We do have a very clear mission, and we do have a fantastic board, so we’ll see what happens at that point.”
Ned and Susan Houston said there are many ideas floating around about what to do with the Sterling College campus and its properties.
“I’m hoping that there will be a group of people who will convene community members and whoever, alums and whoever,” Susan Houston said, “so we can together creatively help design what the future will be, because most of us really need to keep some of the whole vision of the college alive and well through whatever the next reiteration is.”

(Photo by Dale Hogg for Kansas Reflector)BARTON COUNTY — The problem sounds easy: Kansas has too few houses for sale, especially in small, rural communities struggling to attract young people and new businesses.
The simple answer is to build more houses.
But those in real estate say this shortage has been years in the making, and it may take years and creative thinking to emerge from it.
“We’ve been under-building for decades,” said Mark Tomb, vice president of governmental affairs for the Kansas Association of Realtors. “We’re just not building enough homes.”
If all goes as planned, efforts in Barton County may offer a blueprint. The county commission has tapped economic development funds and other resources to help housing developments in three communities.
“If we were to announce one housing development in one city, it would be a big deal,” Commissioner Shawn Hutchinson said. “In this case, we are announcing three different and unique housing developments in three different communities, potentially totaling over 40 new homes in Barton County.”
Hutchinson credited the projects to “exceptional collaboration with community partners.”
“Without growth, we are dying on the vine,” Hutchinson said, stressing the need for central Kansas to innovate. “No one is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves.”
Hoisington, Ellinwood and Claflin are the three communities undertaking projects.
“Housing is a major challenge for our region, impacting our county’s ability to grow and hindering business development, retention and growth,” said Jonathan Mitchell, city manager of Hoisington. “Local governments need to find ways to work with private individuals and organizations to help encourage and facilitate growth.”
Mitchell is “spot on,” said Bekah Selby-Leach, director of the Wichita State University Center for Economic Development and Business Research.
“The smaller markets are just being ignored by developers,” she said.
With a youth exodus and an aging population, she said, these areas don’t make sense for risky speculative construction.

The projects
On Oct. 14, Barton County commissioners approved allocating up to $125,000 in economic development dollars to help a new $600,000-plus development in Hoisington. The project will add 12 new homes to the community of 2,600.
The Hoisington funding will reimburse the city for installing essential infrastructure: curb, gutter and a new concrete street in the new northern subdivision.
Mitchell detailed the city’s significant investment. The city purchased the former Windgate Apartment property, demolished structures, addressed environmental concerns and prepared the grounds. The city has already spent more than $549,000 on the project, with sanitary sewer extensions bringing the total city investment to nearly $691,000.
Hoisington requested the county’s financial aid to expedite construction. The goal is to begin by year’s end or early 2026.
Meanwhile, east of Great Bend, the city of Ellinwood is in the final stretch of a development “about three years in the making,” said city administrator Chris Komarek. The two-square-block Northwest Addition on the community’s northern fringe will house up to 14 new homes in the city of 2,000.
“The county had a pretty significant role in the purchase of the materials,” he said.
The county contributed $200,000 for infrastructure supplies — like sewer and water pipes — for the new Ellinwood District Hospital and the new development. The city has invested about $300,000 so far.
Komarek’s city council approved the sale of the first two lots on Oct. 13, and buyers are interested in two more by year’s end.
“We’ve had quite a bit of interest over the past three years,” he said, noting it waned as the project dragged on and interest rates climbed.
“But, once we get the streets in up there, it will start to look more like a housing addition,” he said.
Water, sewer and communications infrastructure are already in place. Streets should be completed within the month, followed by gas lines.
“We should be done by the end of the year” with all prep work, Komarek said.
Then, home building will begin.
“By the spring, it will be exciting to see,” he said.
In the northeast corner of the county, the Hidden Hills Development sits just outside Claflin’s northern city limits. Developed by the Miller family, owners of Millers of Claflin furniture store, the project includes 16 lots between three and five acres each.
“We hear it every day in the store,” said Brad Miller of comments about the lack of housing in the town of 543 residents. “We got tired of hearing about it and decided to do something.”
He said 12 lots have already been sold. One home is under construction, and two more should break ground after the first of the year.
Even though the Millers bought the land, Miller said, it took community support. The site falls in the Independent Township, which helped surface the roads, and Barton County provided culverts.
“The township and the county have been wonderful to work with,” he said.
City water will serve the area, but homes will use individual septic systems. Natural gas and electric infrastructures are being installed now.
Since the development is in Claflin’s one-mile extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction, it required the city to sign off on the plat. The county commission also had to authorize the layout plan.
The initiative has been in the works for almost two years, Miller said. The Millers originally asked Claflin to annex the site, but city officials decided that taking over the property was too much of a financial burden.
Driven by growth at the nearby ONEOK gas plant and hospitals in neighboring Hoisington and Ellinwood, the area is seeing an influx of young families filling the schools, which has exacerbated the housing shortage.
“We’re happy with this. It’ll be good for the area, and it will be good for the city of Claflin,” Miller said.
 
A new normal
Maranda DeSanto, CEO of the Kansas Association of Realtors, said year-to-date, Kansas has seen 36,790 new listings.
The month’s supply of inventory — a measure of how long it would take to sell all properties at the current pace — was up 4% from a year ago but remains low at 2.6 months. A balanced market traditionally holds four to six months of supply.
But DeSanto said the concept of a balanced market is likely changing.
“We haven’t seen those numbers for about 10 years, so I think we have to agree there’s a new normal to the market,” she said.
The Kansas housing market saw higher prices and persistent low inventory in September. The median sales price for a home rose to $269,000 in September, a jump from $255,000 in September 2024 and $248,000 in September 2023.
DeSanto said the pricing trend is a direct result of the long-term shortage.
“With the basics of supply and demand, this is also a conversation about sales price,” DeSanto said. “While there are always homes for sale, tighter inventory will generally show up in the pricing.”
It’s not just a shortage of houses, Selby-Leach said. It’s also the price points. Fewer lower-priced homes, often starter homes, are being built, while more high-end homes go up. Even homes being built in urban and metro areas are priced out of reach for many buyers.
While mortgage rates seem high, Tomb said, they are hovering near the long-term norm.
Tomb also referred to the 2021 Kansas Statewide Housing Needs Assessment, the state’s first comprehensive housing study in nearly 30 years. It noted that to keep pace with need, 3,800 to 5,000 new homes must be built annually — which is not happening.
The assessment revealed several key challenges: a pervasive shortage of quality, affordable housing for middle-income families; specific housing needs for the state’s aging population; and depressed housing values in many rural areas, hindering investment.
A final key challenge was a severe labor shortage in the building trades, complicating new construction and rehabilitation.
The assessment launched several initiatives in the 2022 legislative session, including the Moderate Income Housing program and the Rural Housing Incentive District program.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Barton-County-housing-Ellinwood-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-28 09:59:58.302022

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) Three Iowa care facilities have been cited for regulatory violations tied to recent resident deaths.
One of the incidents involves a caregiver who mistakenly dispensed the wrong drugs for a resident, and a nurse who then concealed the full scope of the error from the resident’s treating physicians.
That incident took place at Northgate Care Center in Waukon, which has been fined $10,000 by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing for failing to properly assess and treat the resident, who subsequently died.

According to state inspectors, the staff at Northgate mistakenly gave the woman medications intended for another resident — including melatonin to encourage sleep, an antidepressant, an antianxiety medication and an anticoagulant.
Video surveillance footage recorded a short time later showed the resident sitting in a recliner, standing up and immediately falling to the floor. The inspectors’ written description of the footage of the woman’s fall is not entirely clear, with some words apparently missing, but it reads as follows:
7:31:52 – 7:32:04 — The resident stood from her, tripped over her catheter tubing, fell on her left side and hit her head on the recliner all the while Staff A, Licensed Practical Nurse, and Staff B, Certified Nursing Assistant/Certified Medication Aide stood at the nurse’s station.
7:31:59 — Staff A remained at the nurse’s station while Staff B walked around the front of the station with her head positioned down as she looked at an item in her and walked down the north hallway. The resident in site.
7:32:08 — The resident stood from the reclined electric chair.
7:32:13 – 7:32:23 — Staff A casually walked to the resident positioned on the floor and held out her hand towards the resident.
Inspectors say the staff walked the resident to the dining room without first assessing the woman’s injuries. At 9:21 p.m., after the woman complained of pain, an ambulance crew arrived and took her to a hospital where an X-ray indicated she’d sustained a broken leg.
According to inspectors, the resident’s family chose to forgo surgical intervention, which led to hospice care and, at some unspecified point over the next few days, the resident’s death.
According to the inspectors’ report, Staff A, the licensed practical nurse, admitted that after the resident was taken to the hospital, she called the emergency room to report the resident had been given only one incorrect medication — not four — shortly before the fall.
“When asked why she had not told the truth in the beginning, Staff A responded by stating, ‘Because I knew I was wrong,’” the inspectors’ report states.
Other deaths trigger $500 fines
The other recent care-facility deaths that have resulted in state fines are:
REM Iowa in Coralville: This care facility has been fined $500 for failing to provide adequate supervision for a 30-year-old male resident of the home who was diagnosed with a severe intellectual disability and autism.
According to state inspectors, the staff at the home found the man unresponsive in his bed at about 6:55 a.m. on June 30, 2025. He was pronounced dead at 7:35 a.m., with the death certificate listing the cause of death as natural causes related to complications associated with epilepsy.
State inspectors allege the home failed to have checked on the man at least once every 30 minutes, but that he had not been checked after receiving his morning medication at 6:18 a.m.
Harmony House Health Center in Waterloo: This facility has been fined $500 for failing to coordinate and integrate necessary supports for a 29-year-old male resident with severe intellectual disabilities, autism and a history of eating non-food items.
State inspection reports indicate the man was found on the floor of the facility at 5:55 a.m. on Oct. 5, 2025, and was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. Inspectors reported the medical examiner’s office indicated the man had two gloves in his stomach and one lodged in his trachea that blocked his airway, as well as a subdural hematoma sustained in a fall.
Inspectors alleged that despite the man’s documented history of eating cloth, paper, gloves, bugs, towels and virtually anything he found on the floor, the home was unable to produce a behavioral assessment that spoke to the man’s habit of ingesting non-food items.

Since its founding in 2015, the center has offered free and low-cost legal services to more than 25,000 immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers in the Detroit area.
One of those new initiatives is a year-end donation drive, aiming to bring in $250,000 in donations by the end of the year to expand free and low-cost legal services for immigrants and refugees across Southeast Michigan.
The center is also inviting business and community partners to join in its mission of expanding access to justice through collaborative initiatives, which the center uses to expand its legal services.
It is also working on volunteer engagement, with the center continuing to invite attorneys, legal students, translators and researchers to support their goal of ensuring immigrants are welcomed into their communities and that justice does not depend on how much money someone has.
“Each person who walks through our doors carries dreams and challenges,” the center’s Executive Director Kevin Piecuch said in a news release. “To have served 25,000 clients since 2015 means 25,000 steps toward justice, safety and belonging. We’re proud of what has been accomplished – but even more excited about what’s ahead.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-28 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,The duck hunters in the ‘poor line’ pay into wetland conservation,"Héctor Alejandro Arzate, Mississippi Ag & Water Desk",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/28/duck-hunters-pay-into-wetland-conservation/,"The Mississippi River is one of the major rrivers that flow along a key route for migratory birds., known as the Mississippi Flyway,.","COLUMBIA, Mo. — Flocks arrived by the dozens in the dark before sunrise. Some travelled in groups. Others flew solo. They all wanted to land in a wetland, but these specimens needed to wait for the Missouri Department of Conservation to get all their ducks in a row. The MDC and a small bingo cage would decide who got a spot.
No, this was not a crowd of mallards. It was hunters waiting for a shot at migrating waterfowl. 
Throughout the state, duck hunting is permitted at 14 public wetlands but daily reservations are required. Half the spots get awarded through an online lottery before and during the season. The rest are for the “poor line.” Historically, this queue is for people who don’t have access to private land or didn’t score a public reservation.
On a November morning 30 hunters were at Eagle Bluffs Conservation Area near Columbia, Missouri. 
“You get up at four in the morning for a chance to get a spot at one of Missouri’s conservation areas,” Jake Rice said.
There were nine spots available for the drawing. An MDC biologist spun the cage for the hunters, who each got a ball. The lower the number, the better the odds.
The cradle of migrating waterfowl in North America
Eagle Bluffs is located in an alluvial plain of the Missouri River, and over 280 migratory bird species visit the 4,429-acre area each year.
As MDC’s resource supervisor for the region, John George said one of the main goals of the conservation area is to provide birds with a place where they can rest and find food – small acorns from oak trees, seeds, insects and even crops like rice, soybeans, and corn – for the long journey. “They can’t just fly the whole length of the Missouri and hope that they find something at the other end,” George said.
The Missouri is one of the major rivers, along with the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, that flow along a key route for migratory birds. Known as the Mississippi Flyway, about half of all North American species utilize the corridor to get from as far as Canada all the way down to Central and South America, and then back. 
“The Mississippi Flyway is definitely the cradle of migrating waterfowl in North America,” said Jared Mott, who grew up hunting in the state of Mississippi and now serves as conservation director of the Isaak Walton League of America, a national conservation organization.
The region is ideal for duck hunters, too. For the 2024 season, there were an estimated 1.3 million active duck and geese hunters throughout the United States, according to a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service report from August. Of that number, about 40 percent of the U.S. total were in the Mississippi Flyway, which includes 14 states from Minnesota to Louisiana. All together, they harvested approximately 6.4 million ducks and 1.4 million geese.
“It’s got the most ducks, it’s got the most hunters,” Mott said. “When it comes to waterfowl, you just about can’t overstate the importance of wetlands and the habitat that they provide.”
Waterfowl need the habitat not just for migrating south in the winter but also as their breeding grounds in the Prairie Pothole region — which consists of states like Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota. It’s nicknamed the “Duck Factory” because it produces millions of birds each year. 
The success of duck populations – and hunting – is largely dependent on habitat quality and quantity. Both are at risk. Mississippi has 24 wildlife management areas throughout the state that are managed for waterfowl.
More than 130,000 acres of wetlands in the Mississippi River Basin were lost between 2009 and 2019, according to a 2024 report from the USFWS. This has largely been caused by drainage and fill from farming over the past century, along with modern land development and climate change.
In Mississippi, between 1930 and 1973 approximately 8, 170 acres of coastal marshes were filled for industrial and residential uses, according to a  1999 Mississippi’s Coastal Wetlands report from the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources Coastal Preserves Program. 
While many migrating waterfowl have access to state and federally managed wetlands, they also depend on private land throughout the U.S. Yet, in late November, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new guidelines redefining which streams and wetlands qualify for federal regulations under the Clean Water Act. 
The proposal was praised by EPA administrator Lee Zeldin and some agriculture groups, but environmental groups have already raised concerns about the potential impact on the Mississippi River basin’s wetlands. 
“It’s not pretty,” Mott said. 
The rule is open to public comments until January 5, 2026.
The first conservationists in America
Historically, duck hunters played a crucial role in conservation throughout the U.S. They were among some of the first to advocate for the protection for all migratory birds, not just waterfowl, which resulted in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
Today, duck hunters pay into conservation by purchasing state and federal hunting permits. That includes the Federal Duck Stamp, which has raised more than $1 billion to protect approximately 6 million acres of wetlands since 1934. It’s also a popular art contest with hundreds of entries each year. 
“Without those duck hunters, there’d be a lot less habitat out there for waterfowl,” said Jake Spears, the region biologist in Arkansas for Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit for waterfowl and habitat conservation.
A federal tax on the sale of handguns, as well as other firearms and ammunition, generates funding for wildlife restoration each year — approximately $989 million for fiscal year 2024. Additionally, every state has its own way of sourcing conservation funding. For example, in Missouri,  0.125% of the state’s 4.225% sales tax collects funds for state conservation programs.
Eagle Bluffs, where the hunters waited in the poor line for a chance to shoot a duck, is just one example of what that money can do. It’s a restored wetland constructed in the 1990s to fight the loss of nearly 90 percent of Missouri’s wetlands due to agriculture and development. By recycling waste water from a nearby treatment facility, along with river pumps, the area’s wetlands have returned as 17 shallow pools. 
It’s not just duck hunters who benefit from wetland conservation. Tim Eisele, in Madison, is both a duck hunter and one of 96 million bird watching hobbyists in the U.S. 
“I happen to hunt the Mississippi River in the western edge of Wisconsin, and to me, that’s God’s country,” said Eisele. “Just being over there and watching birds move around in the morning or evening.”
“Were it not for the waterfowl hunter that wanted to go out in the marsh with his dog and his shotgun and try to shoot a couple of ducks, we would not have those habitats there available to every Missouri resident,” said Garrett Trentham, the head of the southern region’s events team for Delta Waterfowl, a nonprofit conservation organization.
It’s not even about killing ducks
By five in the morning, most of the hunters in the poor line had left. Those with a spot for the day were probably throwing out their duck decoys. The unlucky likely retreated to their beds. But Jack Honey and a friend remained — despite drawing the second-highest number with ball 16. 
“I’m glad they do this,” Honey said. “Even though you won’t get to hunt one day, but it’s for the benefit of the entire waterfowl.”
Like all good hunters, though, Honey waited patiently. And it paid off with the final spot: a blue hole called Buck Pool. Not the most desirable location to shoot ducks, Honey said, but “you can’t kill ‘em on the couch.”
The pair headed out to a flooded grain field with their waders and shotguns. They waited eagerly for the legal shooting light. All around them, the sounds of geese, coots, green-winged teals, mallards, gadwalls, and even songbirds signalled a new day. 
After a morning hunting, they went home empty-handed, but to Honey, it wasn’t even about killing ducks. 
It was about seeing how nature works. “Seeing how God presented it,” he said.

The recent retirements of Nancy Pelosi and other longtime House Democrats have led to more calls for aging members to pass the torch. Incumbents argue their experience is crucial as the executive branch is upending the balance of power in Washington. 


California’s battleground House districts might get the lion’s share of national attention for their role in deciding which party rules Congress’s lower chamber. 
But in a handful of California’s deep blue districts, an intra-party battle over the future of the Democratic Party is brewing in the wake of grim losses during last year’s presidential race.
In Sacramento, Napa County and Los Angeles, three younger challengers are arguing that Democrats need to give voters fresh faces with bold new ideas to energize the party’s base, rather than aging incumbents who are entrenched more in Washington insider culture than in their districts.
“Status quo politics isn’t going to protect our communities,” said Sacramento City Councilmember Mai Vang, 40, who is running against 10-term Rep. Doris Matsui, 81. “We need leaders who can meet the moment. And that’s why I decided to step into the ring.”
Vang is the first formidable primary challenge that Matsui has faced in the two decades since the congresswoman won her late husband’s seat in 2005. Former Rep. Bob Matsui held that seat for 26 years prior.
Two other senior California congressional Democrats have also attracted primary challengers. Rep. Mike Thompson, 74, of Napa County, a Vietnam veteran vying for his 15th term, faces a challenge from Eric Jones, 34, a former San Francisco venture capitalist. 
And farther south, former Obama and Biden White House climate aide Jake Levine, 41, is challenging Rep. Brad Sherman, 71, of Los Angeles, who is seeking his 16th term. All three challengers have vowed not to take corporate PAC money as their incumbent opponents do.
Around California and across the country, younger challengers argue that Democratic incumbents in safe districts take their seats for granted since they so rarely receive serious challenges. That false sense of security, Vang said, results in out-of-touch members who have fewer incentives to show up in their districts and talk to voters.
Part of meeting the current moment, Vang argues, means taking “bold and courageous” positions on important issues, such as speaking out forcefully against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.
Vang said she wants Matsui to more strongly condemn immigration raids that have torn Sacramento families apart and violated residents’ due process rights. She was disappointed that Matsui’s denunciations centered around the unsanitary conditions of the John E. Moss federal building, where advocates said detainees were being held without access to proper hygiene, rather than on the separation of families and indiscriminate detentions.
“For the past several months we’ve had neighbors, people in our community that have been kidnapped by ICE, taken by ICE, and Doris hasn’t spoken up against that at all,” Vang said. “And especially as someone who was born in the internment camps, I would think she would be on the front lines to speak out on the issues.”
Matsui was born in the Poston War Relocation Center internment camp in Arizona, where her parents were incarcerated during World War II.

“That’s nonsense,” said Roger Salazar, a campaign spokesperson for Matsui, noting local news coverage of Matsui’s statement against an immigration raid on a South Sacramento Home Depot and her attempt to access an ICE detention facility. “She needs to watch the news.” 
Matsui in October hosted a rare in-person forum only after constituents spent months calling on her to meet with them. Angry Sacramentans also hosted an empty-chair town hall in March to highlight Matsui’s absence, not even two weeks after House Democrats did a nationwide blitz of showing up in Republican districts to prove a similar point.
Some senior leaders are sticking around
Calls for generational change within the Democratic Party, while not new, have increased significantly as the party works to find its footing after 2024. The dynamic played out first in internal House leadership races earlier this year, where younger members like Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach leapfrogged more senior colleagues to lead powerful committees. 
Rep. Thompson, Matsui’s congressional counterpart in neighboring Napa County, said his constituents have stopped him in public and asked him to run again. 
“I can’t tell you how many times I had people tell me, ‘I sure hope you’re gonna stick around. We need you more now than ever,’” Thompson told CalMatters. “No one’s asked me to retire. No one has suggested that I’ve been there too long. And everyone knows that not only am I capable, but I’m in good shape.”
In Sacramento, Vang, the eldest of 16 children whose Hmong parents came to the United States as refugees, said she has the utmost respect for the Matsuis and their long history of service. 
Still, she has called on Matsui to follow the examples of House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi — who announced last month that she would retire next year and not seek reelection to a 21st term in Congress — and Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York, who told The New York Times that “now is the right moment to step aside and allow a new generation of leaders to step forward.”
But Matsui remains steadfast that she has much more work to do in Congress, such as overseeing groundbreaking for Sacramento’s new I Street bridge and securing federal funds for flood prevention and wildfire recovery, and said she will stay in the race. She emphasized that the deep relationships she’s built over 20 years in Washington are critical to her ability to deliver on those projects. 
“It’s important to not only have advocates, but have people who understand that once you’re in Congress, you have to learn how to govern, too,” Matsui said. “We cannot just throw everything out and start over again.”
As for Vang’s intra-party primary challenge, Matsui said anyone is “perfectly free” to run against her at any time. “I’m fine with that. This is our democracy. This is America.”
But she insisted that her record would reinforce to voters how hard she works.
“I show up every single day working for Sacramento,” Matsui said, “whether it’s in Sacramento or in D.C.”
The risk of Dem-on-Dem challenges 
One risk of primarying veteran members of Congress is the loss of institutional wisdom, said Gale Kaufman, a Sacramento-based Democratic strategist, particularly with the Trump administration testing the limits of the law and boundaries of power. 
“Especially when you’re up against stuff like this, which we’re not familiar with, breaking every norm you could possibly imagine,” Kaufman said, “having some of those people around is not a bad thing.”
Even among younger Democrats, there’s not wide consensus that incumbents are out and young challengers are automatically in. Evan Cragin, president of the Sacramento County Young Democrats, echoed Kaufman’s point that a blanket policy of “vote out all incumbents over a certain age” could be counterproductive. 
While the Young Democrats have yet to endorse anyone in the congressional races, Cragin said he is personally conflicted about who to support.
“I don’t know who I’m going to vote for,” Cragin said. “It’s nice to have a strong member at the moment, but also, there is part of me that wants to make sure we support our younger members. And Councilmember Mai Vang is a very strong challenger. She’s very community oriented.”
Those who support intra-Democratic challenges argue that they drive important dialogue and force candidates to clearly articulate their ideas and earn voters’ trust, rather than taking their support as a given. Incumbent Democrats across the country could benefit from primary challenges as the party soul searches, said Alex Niles, vice president of political affairs for the Sacramento County Young Democrats.
“We need to have a reckoning and figure out, ‘What does it mean to be a Democrat? What do we stand for? What do people want and who are we serving?’” Niles said.
“The circular firing squad in blue districts hurts our ability to win swing districts.”U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman of Los Angeles
Unsurprisingly, many incumbents and political strategists disagree, denouncing intra-party primaries as expensive distractions that deplete safe members’ fundraising that could otherwise support colleagues in more vulnerable districts.
“The circular firing squad in blue districts hurts our ability to win swing districts,” Rep. Sherman told CalMatters in an interview. 
Candidates in safe districts often support their more vulnerable colleagues to gain clout within the party, whether through direct transfers of campaign cash or by urging their donors to channel their contributions to more contested races. Sherman argues that a competitive intra-Democratic primary forces a safe incumbent to invest more in their own reelection rather than helping flip battleground seats. He repeatedly mentioned tight races in Iowa and Ohio that he views as critical to Democrats reclaiming the House. 
“What happens in swing seats may determine whether America’s a democracy,” Sherman said. “Democrats have got to win seats in Iowa, and we can’t do it unless the strong Democrats in Bel Air and Brentwood and Malibu are focused on Iowa.

“It’s hard to get people in Brentwood to focus on Iowa if there’s a real race in Brentwood.”
He added that while it matters which Democrat represents California’s 32nd Congressional District, the Los Angeles-area seat that he’s represented for almost 30 years, it’s “not life or death for our democracy.”
Sherman’s challenger Levine, who outraised the congressmember last quarter and appears to be the frontrunner in a crowded field, agrees that Democrats need to flip GOP-held seats to reclaim control of the House. But at the same time, if their party wants to retain the majority and win back disaffected voters, Democrats need to prove they’re focused on lowering the cost of living and improving their quality of life, in addition to preserving democracy. 
After leaving Los Angeles to pursue a climate policy career in Washington, D.C., Levine moved back home earlier this year to help his mother after she lost her house — his childhood home — in the devastating Palisades Fire. He was frustrated by the disjointed local and state response to recovery, and he had hoped Sherman would step up and coordinate the response. 
“The things that people want to hear about, and the things that I’m trying to talk about, are the issues in the district,” he said. “Those issues really are not about the composition of the House. They’re not about Washington inside-the-beltway questions of power.”
Instead, Levine wants to see his member of Congress answer the kinds of questions that families like his own think about every day — “Can I afford my rent? Can my kids stay in the same neighborhood where they grew up, and even in the same state, because it’s so prohibitively expensive?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112125-Mai-Vang-Congress-MG-09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-28 08:58:16.176459

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A Georgia nonprofit has become more active in environmental battles around the state, from battles over access to air and water to challenging permissive utility regulations that contribute to high energy costs.
Since opening an office in Birmingham 15 years ago, the Southern Environmental Law Center has partnered with other nonprofits and organizations in legal battles in the public and private sectors.
D.J. Gerken, the president and executive director of SELC, said in an interview that climate change was one motivator for their work.
“We are at the beginning of a climate crisis, and the South has a big hand in causing it,” he said. “Right now, we are paying more for electricity because we are subsidizing fossil fuels. We think that is terrible for families. We know it is terrible for the environment, so we have got a lot of attention on that problem.”

SELC lends legal and advocacy expertise to other organizations and nonprofits and assists them with advancing their mission to protect the environment.
“The reality is that we have so many partner groups in this state with different interests, different cases that they want us to work on, that we do the work from partner groups that come to us that really need to be done,” said Barry Brock, director of the Alabama Office for the Southern Environmental Law Center.
SELC partnered with renewable energy advocacy organizations Energy Alabama and the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution to challenge decisions made by the state’s utility regulator, the Alabama Public Service Commission, that typically rules in favor of Alabama Power.
Recently, SELC challenged a request made by Alabama Power to purchase a natural gas power generating station in Billingsley in Autauga County, which would have led to increased utility rates to pay for the acquisition. Alabama Power said the plant would help it meet increased power demand from data centers. The utility said in a filing with the PSC that the Billingsley power plant is the most cost-effective plan for addressing increased energy use.
SELC sought to stop the purchase, arguing the company did not consider other sources, such as renewable energy, to address the demand, and also  overestimated the amount of electricity that data centers will consume. Alabama Power said in a filing last week it wants to delay the implementation of the rate increase.
SELC is also challenging the process that the PSC uses to decide the rate that Alabama Power can charge its customers for the cost of fuel it buys to generate electricity.
“The way they have been doing that is through this secretive procedure where they don’t have a public hearing,” Brock said. “They don’t invite public input.” The rate ECR can be adjusted as often as every month when Alabama Power makes a request to the utility regulator. The Public Service Commission then issues consent orders to adjust the rate.
SELC is also taking on cases that deal with pollution, particularly for residents living in rural areas.

(Getty Images)Total holiday spending in Nevada is forecast to be higher this year than last year, but spending per person will likely decline, while seasonal hiring nationally will fall to its lowest level in 15 years, holiday economic forecasters say.
At an estimated $6.5 billion, total holiday spending by Nevadans is projected to be 4% larger than in 2024, the Retail Association of Nevada (RAN) said in a forecast this week.
That’s in line with a national increase of between 3.7% and 4.2% forecast by the National Retail Federation (NRF).
Both fall short of last year, when national holiday spending grew by 4.3%. 
“Consumers are navigating a complex landscape” in which “inflation, elevated interest rates, and a reliance on credit are all factors contributing to a more discerning shopper this season,” RAN said in a press release.
“While spending will increase in absolute dollars, consumers are prioritizing value, seeking deals, and managing their budgets strategically,” RAN said.
In October, a report for NRF estimated consumers nationally would spend an average of $890.49 per person this year, down 1.3% from last year’s $901.99
A consumer survey performed by Deloitte Insights indicates a much sharper holiday spending decline of 10% from 2024.
Some analysts are predicting a “K shaped” shopping season, where the spending line representing more affluent consumers goes up, and the line for less well-off consumers goes down.
However, Deloitte found spending would decrease among all income groups surveyed, including those with incomes of more than $200,000.
Slow to no hiring
Holiday hiring is also expected to decline this year compared to 2024. “Following a summer of subdued hiring,” said a forecast on seasonal hiring issued in late September from the Challenger, Gray & Christmas outplacement firm, Challenger “expects seasonal retail hiring in 2025 to fall to its lowest point since the recession-hit season of 2009.”
“Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s senior vice president. “While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less.”
NRF’s national forecast released this month was similarly downbeat on seasonal hiring. There were 442,000 seasonal hires in 2024. But NRF’s forecast expects retailers to hire “between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, in line with a slower-paced labor market,” the lowest amount of seasonal hiring in 15 years. 
“Because of the ongoing tariff situation, retailers will be closely monitoring spending patterns and waiting to make staff additions should demand strengthen throughout the holiday season,” said NRF economist Mark Matthews.
RAN’s forecast did not include Nevada-specific seasonal hiring projections.
Souring sentiment
In another indicator of holiday economic activity released this week, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index indicates consumers are entering the season with sour outlooks for business and labor market conditions.
The index fell 7 points in November to 88.7 (1985=100), the lowest score since April, when Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs and launched a global trade war that shocked markets and consumer sentiment. The plunge in April was the lowest the index had been since 2021.
Consumers are “notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,” said Dana Peterson, the Conference Board’s chief economist, in a statement accompanying the index’s release. “Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings,” Peterson added.
But the Conference Board’s release also noted that while consumers’ write-in responses “continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics,” there were also “increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,” suggesting that could also be contributing to tumbling consumer sentiment. 
Also this week, the Census Bureau released revised estimates for U.S. retail sales which, adjusted for seasonal variations, were effectively flat in September (up 0.1% from August) — before the government was shutdown.
Deloitte’s “holiday spending confidence index” was even less encouraging than the Conference Board’s. More than three-fourths (77%) of consumers surveyed expected prices to be higher, and 57% expect the economy to get weaker in 2026, “the least optimistic outlook since Deloitte started tracking economic sentiment in 1997.”
Nevada retailers have strived to adapt to “the new economic normal,” said Retail Associaion of Nevada President Bryan Wachter in a release.
“They are offering compelling value, innovating their business models, and working tirelessly to meet the consumer where they are, both online and in-store.”
“This season won’t be without its challenges, but our members are prepared to deliver a successful and competitive holiday shopping experience,” Wachter said. 
Matthews, the NRF’s president, offered a similarly glass-half-full assessment.
“The economy has continued to show surprising resilience in a year marked by trade uncertainty and persistent inflation,” he said. “As tariffs have induced an uptick in consumer prices, retailers have tried to hold the line on prices given the uncertainty about trade policies.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1450312824-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 08:58:16.176459

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Data center operator DartPoints plans to up the capacity of its Greenville center by 400%.
But unlike the super centers popping up around the Palmetto State, each gobbling upwards of 100 megawatts of power, DartPoints’ growth is on a much smaller scale — 12.5 megawatts, up from a 2.5-megawatt starting point.
The company pledged this month to invest $125 million in the expansion of its Greenville location, adding 88,000 square feet to the facility.
At the heart of the company’s expansion: artificial intelligence.
DartPoints’ customers are now demanding three times the capacity and computing power compared to just a year or so ago, CEO Scott Willis told the SC Daily Gazette.
“AI potentially has the opportunity to change their business in a very dramatic way. We’ve got to come along with that,” he said.
Companies are turning to AI bots to run customer care chats. Robots in manufacturing are becoming more autonomous. And from a health care perspective, hospital systems are offering more computer-heavy remote services, with wearable devices that track vitals like heart rate and blood sugar, Willis said.
So expanding is essential, he said, if DartPoints wants its centers to remain relevant over the next five years.
“It is no longer a ‘nice to have.’ It’s a requirement, on our part, to understand that change, anticipate that change,” Willis said.
More than a decade in SC
DartPoints has operated data centers in South Carolina for more than a decade. With locations in Columbia, Spartanburg and Charleston, as well as Greenville, the state is the Dallas-headquartered company’s largest market.
To finance its expansion in South Carolina, as well as in Ohio and Indiana, DartPoints secured a $250 million investment from a pair of partners earlier this year.
“South Carolina is a great business environment,” Willis said. “It’s a great state, positioned within the Southeast. It’s growing massively in terms of attracting businesses, and we want to participate in that.”
But consumer groups and politicians have pushed back against the proliferation of data centers over the past couple years. Most of that ire is aimed at so-called hyperscale centers, owned and operated by tech giants such as Google and Meta.
Meta invests in SC solar as utilities expect more clean energy-conscious firms to finance projects

These windowless centers, which house rows of servers, are among the largest drivers of growing power needs in the state, generating vast demand for electricity on top of the needs of an ever-growing manufacturing and population base.
Willis is quick to point out not all data centers are the same.
For starters, he said, utilities already have the kind of capacity on their system that DartPoints requires.
“We are a non-invasive partner inside the state,” Willis said. “We don’t disrupt the demand of the grid. We’re not asking Duke (Energy) or other utilities to invest a significant amount of money that could result in price increases for the overall citizens of the state of South Carolina.”
A different kind of customer
DartPoints also tends to serve customers that require a bit more privacy and control over their IT systems.
The company specializes in private, dedicated servers that its customers can access remotely, with guarantees that the computing power will always be available for that customer’s use. Turning to Google or Microsoft or Amazon Web Services, businesses share space on those companies’ servers, using what’s known as a public cloud system, Willis said.
If a DartPoints customer wants even more control, they can choose to have their own servers caged within a DartPoints facility that only that company’s employees have access to. DartPoints simply supplies the space and power it takes to operate and cool the equipment.
Before DartPoints moved into the state, Willis said, companies had to turn to major providers in big cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte or Nashville or major computing hubs in northern Virginia, for these serices.
Now, companies have a local option that often comes at a lower cost because they don’t have to lay down lines of fiber to get connected to a distant center. The computing speeds are also faster because companies don’t have to wait for their data to travel longer distances over the network, a major bonus as more are turning to artificial intelligence.
In all, DartPoints has about 300 customers that use its four South Carolina data centers, Willis told legislators last September. Those companies collectively generate $60 billion in revenue within the state and employ about 140,000 people.
DartPoints’ customer base mirrors the state’s major economic sectors — manufacturing, health care, some financial institutions and state and local government, as well as higher education.
“DartPoints’ growth in Greenville shows how innovation and infrastructure investment go hand in hand,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “This project reinforces South Carolina’s position as a destination for technology-driven business and demonstrates how our state can support advanced digital operations with the power, talent and collaboration they require to thrive.”
Construction is underway and the additional space is expected to be operational in July 2027.
The company does not publicize how many people it employs in South Carolina but pledged 10 new jobs as part of the expansion.
After Greenville, Willis said, DartPoints will turn its attention to growing its Columbia center, located within the South Carolina Research Authority Innovation Center. Details on that expansion are forthcoming, he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 08:58:16.176459

(Screenshot)Rural counties in New Mexico have scant news coverage of their communities, and Native American and Spanish-speaking residents have few options in their languages. These are just two of the takeaways from a recent in depth analysis of the state’s news ecosystem, published alongside an  interactive local news map.
The study’s results did not surprise New Mexico Local News Fund Executive Director Rashaad Mahmood, who commissioned the work. The impetus came from the growing national philanthropic interest in supporting local journalism, and the concomitant need for more data to help funders understand local needs. LNF runs a variety of fundraising and training programs across the state.
While national studies in recent years have taken the measure of local news systems, Mahmood wanted a report that would analyze New Mexico at a more granular level, and specifically highlighted Colorado’s News Mapping Project at the outset as a model.
“It was kind of a no-brainer,” Mahmood told Source NM. “If we want to help more people in New Mexico have access to high quality local news information, we need to understand in more detail: Where are the communities that don’t have that, and where are the strengths? And then do some analysis of what are opportunities for our work and for other funders and people to make a difference.”
University of New Mexico journalism Professor of Practice Gwyneth Doland said while research into New Mexico’s news landscape quantified some of its challenges, it also unearthed new and innovative projects. (Courtesy photo)
Gwyneth Doland, a professor of practice in the University of New Mexico’s Communications and Journalism Department, and retired UNM Professor Michael V. Marcotte, who now runs MVM Consulting, co-lead the research behind the more than 150-page study.
The work included a detailed survey sent to news outlets statewide; the creation of a database of 139 outlets (including Source NM); and a content analysis of the strength and effectiveness of each outlet—all data that can be accessed through the map. Doland and Marcotte also surveyed more than 1,100 New Mexico residents about their news habits; conducted focus groups around the state to complement the survey data; and conducted one-on-one interviews with media representatives to “fill in gaps and add context to our data,” a news release announcing the study noted.
The research revealed that close to half of the state’s news outlets are based in Albuquerque/Rio Rancho; Santa Fe; Los Cruces; and Farmington, leaving smaller communities with fewer sources for news and information. Moreover, four counties have no news outlets at all. The state’s digital divide also impacts residents’ news options.
But the work also revealed new initiatives and a fundamental desire among residents to stay informed and connected to their communities.
Marcotte traces the genesis of the recent report back nearly a decade to work he undertook for the national foundation Democracy Fund in assessing New Mexico’s news landscape. Doland also worked on that report.
“We basically just interviewed news leaders and editors around the state to put together kind of a little more of an impressionistic report about what’s happening in local news in New Mexico,” Marcotte, who was the lead author on that study, said. “We called it the precarious local news ecosystem of New Mexico, and that preceded funding for [the Local News Fund] and a lot of the activity that has followed that.”
The growing philanthropic interest in local news, he noted, helped grow the need for “a more sophisticated look at what’s happening on the ground.”
But the seeds of the current landscape—the news deserts and the loss of smaller communities’ newspapers—stretches back farther, Doland said.
“I think we’re on this train of disruption in the media landscape that really accelerated in the early 2000s with the internet all of a sudden becoming the place where things that used to happen in newspapers started happening online,” she said.
That “digital disruption,” Doland continued, “precipitated the loss of news organizations across the country,” including the loss of newspapers. “And that process of newspapers closing their doors makes people freak out,” she said, “because we know that high quality local news correlates directly with civic health.”
That’s why numerous philanthropic organizations and other groups have become increasingly focused on local news, she said. “They want to help,” she said. “They want to improve communities.”
While the study affirmed what its authors already knew about the areas of news deserts across the state, lost newspapers and shrinking television coverage, it also revealed emergent new community media efforts.
“Doing this research was good for us to learn about some of the great things that are out there,” Doland, “some of the new, fun, cool things where there is energy and innovation and creativity happening.” One example she cited is the Cloud Croft Reader, a newsletter whose creators, she said, recently completed the LNF news accelerator training program. “Now they’re growing,” she noted. “They’re doing great work down there.”
Which is not to say that all media endeavors made the cut for the New Mexico News Map and accompanying database.
Retired UNM journalism Professor Michael Marcotte, president and owner of MVM Consulting, says an analysis of New Mexico’s news ecosystem nearly a decade ago laid some of the foundation for a more recent study. (Courtesy photo)
“We kind of set a bar for local news,” Marcotte said. “Are you actually doing local news, or are you just saying words that people confuse as news. Do you have a journalist working there? Are you reporting it? Do you have an ethical code? We made this sort of fine-tuned distinction between what I’m just going to call noise versus news.” As a result, an original list of 360 outlets was whittled down to 139, he said.
Ultimately, the report highlights what’s lacking in the state’s news ecosystem, but also provides actionable recommendations for addressing them. Those include expanding funding for small, rural and tribal news outlets, but also improving broadband access across the state, strengthening training programs and diversifying revenue streams, to name a few.
“One of the primary users of this report, we hope, is the general public,” Marcotte said. “We think the general public should be well informed of what local news is, who’s doing it, where is it happening…and the best we can hope is [for people to] support local journalism.”
But given all the different interest groups: news creators, consumers and funders, Doland said another important recommendation lies in the need for ongoing collaboration.
“One of New Mexico’s great positives and opportunities and successes so far is this level of collaboration between the university and the industry; between the non-profits and the for-profits …between the Local News Fund and the community foundations,” Doland said. “All of this is really good connection so far, and we encourage people to build on that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newsmap-920x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-28 07:57:51.337645

Jones was semiretired and looking for a way to leverage their property for additional income. One night, they decided to dive into farming mushrooms. After a few late-night online purchases, Root 54 Farm was up and running.
They made some mistakes along the way. But with the help of a now-defunded program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they spend almost 15 hours a week traveling to various farmers markets and selling to other buyers in Sedalia, Joplin and Springfield.
“Owning a business is overwhelming,” Jones said. “Farming is overwhelming. When the two come together, it’s super overwhelming. So we are really grateful to people who help.”
The Heartland Regional Food Business Center was a part of a Biden administration program aimed at increasing the resilience of local food systems following the COVID-19 pandemic. The program aimed to help small and midsized farms with things like market access and technical assistance to help them grow and maintain their businesses.
But under Trump administration budget cuts, USDA terminated the program.
Now, its leaders are figuring out how to move forward under a new moniker — the Heartland Regional Food Business Coalition — and without the millions of dollars in federal funding once used to support their work.
The program reimbursed farmers for big purchases and helped make connections between farmers and potential buyers. Jones and Munro were never selected for monetary support, but the connections they made helped their business take off.
“We met a lot of the people we needed to meet,” Jones said.
 What’s next for the regional food business centers? 

Heartland was one of a handful regional food business centers established by the USDA. It officially launched in 2023 to help farmers across Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and some Arkansas counties.
The group was slated to get $25 million in funding over four years. But it only made one round of grants to farmers before the rest of the funding was rescinded this summer.
In the only round of grant funding under USDA, Heartland provided nearly $4 million in financial assistance to 90 farmers after receiving nearly 500 applications from across the region.
Heartland was preparing for the second round of Business Builder grants — nearly $9 million in funding — and expected over 1,000 farmers to apply. Instead, it got word that federal funds may be pulled.
The group and its farmers ended up waiting six months to see if that money would actually be paid out.
One farmer was a sunflower producer who was looking for funds to upgrade his packaging process.
“He was ready and poised to expand his market this year,” said Katie Nixon, who currently shepherds the coalition through New Growth, a rural community development corporation in El Dorado Springs, Missouri.
Because the funding comes as reimbursements, farmers had to make the upgrades before they could see any of the money.
“You’re paralyzed — you’ve gotten this grant and they say, ‘If you spend the money, you’re not going to get reimbursed,’” Nixon said. “So do you say, ‘Well forget it, I’m just going to go my own way and lose $50,000, or do you wait?’”
Along with programs like Local Food for Schools, which was also eliminated earlier this year, the federal initiative was part of a larger effort to promote local food systems across the country.
“They took the conditions of the region and really focused to amplify that to provide an unmet demand from the rest of the nation,” said Hannah Quigley, a policy specialist at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition. “They were investing in scaling very regional specialized products.”
Support from the regional centers across the country resulted in more than 2,600 new partnerships between farmers and buyers, a June 2024 USDA brief said.
The June data also showed the program taking off. Farmers were starting to report improved processing, distribution, storage and aggregation of regional food products as a result of the support from their regional centers under the initiative.
Part of the reason for the success is because the money was there to actually keep people involved in the conversation. There are so many demands on small farmers, Nixon said. Without the possibility of some financial support, it can be difficult to prioritize where to spend your time.
“This just helped (relationships) become stronger and more formalized, because you had money to help keep people at the table,” Nixon said.
“We know that a lot of food and farm businesses came to us for technical assistance because they saw the Business Builder opportunity,” Nixon said. “So having that funding to be able to offer really gets people motivated.”
Only a small portion of federal farm support goes to producers of specialty crops, which includes produce like fruits and vegetables or nursery crops, Quigley said.
In the 1970s, the U.S. was a net exporter of those specialty crops. By the mid-1990s, it became a net importer. Still, in 2020 speciality crops contributed nearly $54 billion to U.S. agriculture’s $363 billion in cash receipts, USDA data from 2022 show.
“We have plenty of land and the way that our food system is organized right now, with commodity crops — most of those are grown specifically to send somewhere else to export,” Nixon said. “What if even just a sliver of that energy was actually to domesticate real food products?”
For smaller farmers, having dedicated support for funding and market access could make a huge difference in their success.
Heartland hosts monthly new farmer calls and connects farmers with established mentors to help them grow their specialty crop.
“They were connecting these farmers who might not have immediately known how to get connected to a distributor,” Quigley said. “I think a farmer could figure it out, but it might take them two full years, potentially three different growing seasons … to figure it out.”
From July 2023 to June 2024, the centers nationwide formalized more than 250 partnerships for their farmers. In the last six months of 2024, they finalized 466.
They were trying to reach the farmers who traditionally don’t receive USDA loans, Nixon said.
Nixon and her colleagues are looking for sources to make up for some of the lost USDA funding. But what exactly that will mean is still unclear.
“Local food is not easy,” Nixon said. “We’re trying to make it easier.”
 How to build out a regional food system 

Part of the difficulty in building up more regional food systems comes from connecting farmers to wholesale buyers who need large quantities of produce.
That was some of what the regional centers were aiming to address.
“In some cases, they connected small farmers to an aggregator, or someone who brokered purchases, then they were able to aggregate them, buy from all these small farmers and then sell to a single buyer,” Quigley said.
That structure could help incentivize larger purchasers like food banks, states or school districts to buy more local food.
Because of the control wholesale grocery suppliers have over those markets, it can be more difficult for businesses to stray away from what has become the mainstream model for buying food.
Quigley pointed to agreements the USDA has with states that let states take a more hands-on approach to local food purchasing.
“That brings those contracts down from a national scale or a 12-state scale, down to a single-state scale,” Quigley said. “It allows for a greater number of farmers and businesses to be able to successfully bid on those contracts. They don’t have to have a distribution network to serve 12 states, they can just serve a single state.”
A 2020 local food marketing survey found that the number of farms selling locally produced food fell by 12% nationwide from 2015 to 2020.
Still, Missouri is seeing some growth when it comes to produce farmers. The 2022 Census of Agriculture in Missouri found that the number of farms working in greenhouse, nursery and floriculture production had grown to 485 in 2022, up from 348 in 2017.
In 2021, more than 90% of the farms selling food directly to consumers were considered small farms.
“When you buy from somebody local, your money stays local,” Munro said. “When you’re in the local food business, you really get to know people, and we really do support each other. It’s part of what I love, it is a community.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)In any other year, the data that informs an annual report released every Thanksgiving by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank would tell the whole story about hunger in the Ocean State. 
But 2025 has been unlike any other year for the Providence-based nonprofit — especially after the recent federal shutdown disrupted benefits for 42 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including 145,000 Rhode Islanders.
Which is why the release of the annual “Status Report on Hunger in Rhode Island” will have to wait until late January.
“The recent federal government shutdown and SNAP delay has been our top priority this fall,” Melissa Cherney, the food bank’s CEO, said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “We remain committed to putting together a comprehensive report and providing an in-depth look at who is food insecure in Rhode Island that takes into account how the government shutdown has impacted food security in our state.”
First released in 2007, the annual report lists how many households across the state struggle to afford adequate meals, receive food assistance, along with policy recommendations on how to reduce hunger.
Last year’s six-page report focused on the need for Congress to expand federal programs like SNAP, which the food bank projected could help the 90,500 households enrolled at the time to easily afford three healthy meals per day. The report had also urged state leaders to reduce barriers for SNAP enrollment.
The food bank’s report typically relies on hunger data compiled by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health as part of its annual RI Life Index survey. But that survey is conducted in the spring. 
Food bank spokesperson Kate MacDonald said the data would not account for the rapid increase in food insecurity across Rhode Island observed this fall during the 43-federal government shutdown.
Food pantries in the state served around 100,000 people in the month of October. Pantries last year served roughly 84,400 individuals per month, which at the time was the highest total tracked by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.
“We want to be able to capture that in our status report,” MacDonald said in an interview. “The data we’re working with has to represent what’s going on now.”
Food bank staff had to shift their focus away from completing the report during the shutdown i to ensuring there was enough food to distribute across its 137 affiliated pantries and other agencies, MacDonald added.
SNAP payments have since resumed now that the longest federal shutdown in history has ended, but the fallout continues, MacDonald said.
“Families who were impacted might be seeing these effects for a little while,” she said. “Families have made choices in what bills to pay and what not to pay.”
Then there’s the massive changes to SNAP under President Trump and Republicans’ signature tax legislation, known as the “one big, beautiful bill.” Under the new law, parents and older Americans will be required to meet stricter work requirements, and states eventually will have to share in the cost of SNAP benefits.
The law also cuts off access completely for refugees and other immigrants starting Feb. 1, 2026.
“It’s going to take some time for what that all means for people’s monthly benefits,” MacDonald said.
The food bank’s full 2025 report will be released Jan. 27 to coincide with Food Insecurity Awareness Day, when its leaders will gather at the State House and hold a virtual town hall to discuss the latest findings.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)How best to spend, save and raise money will be a recurring theme when Washington lawmakers convene in Olympia next week for their annual “committee days.” 
The state is facing a budget shortfall that’s poised to dominate the 2026 session, which begins Jan. 12.
Data centers, vaccine safety, bridges hit by trucks, and the states mounting legal payouts are other issues to be tackled in the three days of work sessions, which start Wednesday.
This year, both chambers will be in town at the same time. It will provide a sense of the pace and tenor of policy debates to come in next year’s 60-day session.
Wednesday, Dec. 3, is reserved for meetings of seven committees composed of House and Senate members. On Thursday and Friday, individual House and Senate committees will meet starting at 8 a.m. each day. 
Data Centers will grab the spotlight at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday. That’s when the Joint Committee on Energy Supply, Energy Conservation, and Energy Resilience will hear recommendations of the data center work group established by an executive order from Gov. Bob Ferguson. A report from the work group is due to the governor by Dec. 1. Data centers consume large amounts of electricity, and more are coming online as artificial intelligence technology expands.
Also Wednesday, health insurance costs and vaccine safety will be on the agenda when the Joint Select Committee on Health Care and Behavioral Health Oversight meets at 3 p.m. 
Thursday will be dominated by budget-related conversations.
This year, Democratic lawmakers pushed through billions in new and increased taxes, along with spending cuts, to bridge a projected gap around $16 billion over four years.
Concerns about one of the largest new business taxes that took effect Oct. 1 will be a hot topic in the House Finance Committee at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. 
Senate Bill 5814 imposes new sales taxes on a number of services and is counted on to bring in $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1. Local governments will get a cut of the state sales tax proceeds. Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, the committee chair, has said the law needs fine-tuning to make clearer who is required to collect and pay the taxes.
Operating and transportation expenses will be showcased in four different budget committees meeting at 4 p.m. Thursday.
The Senate Ways and Means Committee has a packed agenda with discussions on future tax collections, growing lawsuit payouts, and state pensions. 
In the House Appropriations Committee, conversations are planned on the state’s budget outlook, plus updates on federal funding and Washington’s strained juvenile rehabilitation system.
Highway maintenance and preservation will be a focus of both the Senate and House transportation panels. The Senate Transportation Committee will devote its one-hour work session to the subject.
Meanwhile, members of the House Transportation Committee will get briefed on how the state Department of Transportation is dealing with bridges damaged by truck collisions. Also on the agenda is an update on the Washington State Ferries multi-billion-dollar electrification program.

Rich Draheim, R-Madison Lake, recently announced that he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing his belief in term limits as his reason for leaving the Legislature.
Draheim was first elected in 2016 to the state Senate, beating out then Sen. Kevin Dahle as part of the Trump red wave that flipped the state Senate and added state House seats to the GOP majority. 
Draheim has been a leader on housing, human services and mental health issues. 
In 2022, he was the chief author of a law directing more than $92 million to mental health initiatives, including services for uninsured youth and mobile crisis response teams. Draheim also advocated for the creation of the Senate Housing and Homelessness Prevention Committee — it had previously been grouped in a committee with agriculture and rural development — giving housing issues more attention in the Legislature.
Draheim is a business owner, having owned a marina, an event center, a wedding shop and other real estate investments. 
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you decide not to run for re-election?
I never really intended on being a politician, so it wasn’t on my radar, and someone asked me to run. I’ve always been a strong believer in term limits. To me, serving is giving back to the community, and I think the more different voices we have, the better we are. A lot of us (politicians) get sucked into that trap of thinking we’re all important, not remembering that the district is the people’s district, not our district. 
I didn’t want to pick my replacement, so that’s why I announced a year ahead of time that I’m not running — so people have the opportunity to get their ducks in a row if they want to run and then just go through the process like I went through the process 10 years ago.
What will you do with the time you get back from not being in the Legislature?
It’s unknown. I’ve been a habitual business starter, and I don’t think my wife’s gonna let me do that. So I will be looking for a new opportunity, a new challenge. I like to have new challenges, usually about every seven years, so I’m kind of overdue.
What are you most proud of from your time in the Legislature?
The effort. It’s a lot of work to run for office and take out an incumbent like I did in a purple district that historically had gone back and forth. I just worked harder than he did, and I knocked on door after door after door and talked to people, just trying to figure out, what are their needs? What do they think the state should be doing differently? 
I’ve been reporting for a couple years on this effort to build more housing in Minnesota. There’s a few ways you could describe it — zoning reform, rolling back regulations, taking away some local government controls. How real is the bipartisan push to build more housing in Minnesota, and do you think that the Legislature will get a big package done on this?
I hope people open up their eyes a little bit on that. It’s something I’ve been working on for nine years. I view everything through the lens of, the state’s responsibility should be to educate our kids to get a career-path job. That career-path job should lead to a pathway to homeownership. That pathway to homeownership should lead to a pathway to retirement.
We know that most people’s largest asset, overwhelmingly, is their home. We’re chasing perfection on the building code and zoning over the fact that people can’t afford to own a home. At some point, I think society needs to say, time out. I’m comfortable living in a house that has the 2000 building code instead of 2025. I’m okay not having the white picket fence, or the hard surfaces in the front, or I don’t need a three car garage or whatever it is.
I think we have to open it up more to individuals to pick what they can have. I mean, in most of the southern suburbs, you can hardly find a home for under $550,000 and I don’t know how these young people can afford it. 
I ran for my family and my kids, and I want to see Minnesota have an environment where, if they choose to buy a home they can afford one — of course, with hard work and savings and smart business decisions — that should be the goal, and I think we’re pushing away from that at full speed. You look at when Minnesota builds or helps pay for an apartment — there was just one last year that the cost of each individual unit was $631,000. We could do better. Our young families deserve better. Our old families deserve better. Our seniors deserve better.
The cost of everything’s going up, but the cost of insurance has gone up by double digit increases every year. And then property taxes, of course, have gone up.
I was reading the blog post you put out after the Annunciation shooting, in which you basically said the Legislature needs to work more on mental health instead of focusing so much on guns. What gaps do you think still exist in Minnesota’s mental health system, even after the work that you’ve been doing on this for many years?
We barely touched the surface on mental health. We’re so far in a deficit. If I was able, I would propose more training for our young people on how to cope. 
One of my colleagues across the aisle told me it wasn’t a mental health problem, it was a morality problem. Well, to me, part of being defined in mental health is what’s right and what’s wrong. We have a big problem — a large portion of our youth don’t value life, and that’s very scary. To me, a normal person, to think it’d be okay to stand outside of church or school and shoot up a bunch of poor, helpless little kids — that’s not healthy to even think about it, let alone do it or celebrate it. Or a health care executive, or anybody for that matter, a national pundit, whatever it is — we shouldn’t celebrate the murder of any individual. That’s a society problem, but I think our kids need to learn to cope. 
God made us all different. We’re all created a little different. We all are fortunate and have different triggers and this and that, but we’ve got to figure out how to live with it, and I don’t think we do a good enough job. I don’t think families do enough of a job to teach their kids, it’s okay, maybe you need to go read books, go shoot baskets, listen to some music, whatever it is. So I think we need to work on that.
What advice would you give to the person who has your seat after you?
It’s the people’s district. The funnest part of being an elected official was having to dig into a whole bunch of different topics, and every committee you’re on, you have to get caught up. Luckily, we have great staff in our caucus that help us get caught up and understand the federal programs, the state programs, the county programs, how they all interact. That’s a challenge — for every committee it’s different programs. That’s been really rewarding for me is to try to learn about a whole bunch of different topics.
Is there anything else you want people to know about your decision not to run again?
I encourage everybody to give back. Our society is so jaded right now, and I ran for my kids, and I ran to give back. I was at a point in my career where I could take a pay cut — which is a whole other issue — to give back to my region down here in south central Minnesota. We need more people that have life experiences to step up — no matter what their background, because all jobs are honorable — to give back to the state and run for office in some form.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/draheim-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 07:57:51.337645

“As the pace of change accelerates, we need to build a more adaptive and competitive state – standing still now only widens the gap,” Jeff Donofrio, president and CEO of Business Leaders For Michigan, said in a news release. “[Our plan] focuses on changing what’s within our control – three areas that, when working well, have the greatest power to change our state’s trajectory.”
Specifically, the plan calls for leaders to transform education, make Michigan the easiest place to build and grow and to modernize its approach to economic development to activate the state’s economic potential.
Donofrio argued that Michigan’s challenge in retaining talent and building its economy is not based on ideas or effort, but consistency and follow-through. 
“When priorities shift, progress stalls,” Donofrio said. “We need a long-term strategy that endures beyond election cycles. Other states have shown what’s possible when that happens.”
In improving education, the group’s plan calls for the state to ensure every child can read by third grade, tackle chronic absenteeism, set a high standard for a high school diploma, and seamlessly connect students to apprenticeships, college and careers.
It also recommends removing barriers to economic growth by supporting a culture of customer service, streamlining regulations and supporting communities ready to innovate.
In addressing the state’s approach to economic development, Business Leaders for Michigan called for the state to empower its regions and adopt a consistent approach for attracting and retaining talent.
Moving forward, the group said the state must have a plan that goes beyond one governor, political party or interest group, and it must be championed by the governor, built by the Legislature and sustained beyond political terms.
“Michigan’s future will continue to be defined by our ability to come together around a common vision for growth,” said Gary Torgow, the group’s chair. “If we continue to stay focused and work together, Michigan can endeavor to lead the nation in creating opportunity and prosperity for all.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A new report urges New Jersey to step up oversight of hazardous rail-borne freight nearly 13 years after a derailment in Paulsboro released tens of thousands of gallons of a toxic gas that left 60 hospitalized.
The new report from New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning Trenton-based think tank, seeks more transparency on train routes and the creation of evacuation zones along them to guard residents against toxic spills.
“Freight rail companies have spent years lobbying against safety rules while prioritizing their own profits over better infrastructure. Meanwhile, millions of New Jerseyans live in evacuation zones without knowing what chemicals are rolling past their kids’ schools,” said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst for the think tank and the report’s author. “Lawmakers need to stop letting corporate interests block protections that could save lives.”
What hazardous materials travel on trains around New Jersey? It’s a secret.

The report cautions that the state lacks protections to adequately guard the 3.6 million New Jerseyans who live within a mile of freight lines that could cause toxic spills or fires, plus the more than 1,300 schools and nearly 120 hospitals.
It also urges additional training and hazmat equipment for first responders and stricter safety rules for the trains themselves.
“Far too many people, including state decision makers, are not truly aware of the risk associated with the thousands of trains carrying hazardous materials throughout every corner of our state,” said Debra Coyle, executive director of the New Jersey Work Environment Council.
Gov. Chris Christie in 2017 vetoed legislation that would require rail firms to disclose train routes, citing national security concerns.
The report says that requiring train companies to report past cargo after a time delay and mandating that the Department of Transportation share bridge inspection reports with the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees hazmat control, could increase safety while allaying security risks.
Some officials have long eyed stricter disclosure rules and requiring response plans to hazardous spills from freight companies, but efforts to pass them have stalled in legislative chambers or on the governor’s desk.
Transportation committee chairs in both chambers are seeking to impose stricter rules on freight that would require at least two crew members to operate any train carrying hazardous materials and impose limits on train length. Longer trains are more likely to derail.
“More than a decade after the Paulsboro train derailment, too many New Jersey communities continue to live with the daily risk posed by freight lines that transport hazardous materials through their neighborhoods,” said Assemblyman Clint Calabrese (D-Bergen), who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee.
The 2012 Paulsboro derailment released roughly 23,000 gallons of vinyl chloride — a toxic, carcinogenic precursor chemical used in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride polymers — after a conductor’s error sent four train cars off a bridge and into a creek.

Last month, the Federal Highway Administration approved Idaho’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, plans, Idaho Transportation Department Communication Manager John Tomlinson said. 
The NEVI program was created to develop plans for a network of connected electric vehicle charging stations located every 50 miles along designated interstates and highways, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
For several years a working group in Idaho had been developing plans, gathering public feedback and identifying potential sites for electric vehicle charging stations when the federal government halted all work on the projects and suspended approving state plans, the Sun previously reported. On Feb. 6, less than three weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, Federal Highway Administration officials sent state transportation directors letters saying they were immediately suspending approving state plans and rescinding past guidance for the NEVI program.

State officials were told to await further federal guidance, which then arrived in August.
On Sept. 10, Idaho Transportation Department Director Scott Stokes resubmitted Idaho’s plans and requested the state’s share of funding for fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2026, the Sun previously reported. 
Stokes included a siting, feasibility and access study from 2024 when he resubmitted Idaho’s plans and pointed out the parts of Idaho’s plans that addressed the latest federal government guidance from August. But Stokes did not make any big changes to Idaho’s plans, which were updated in 2023 and 2024.
Last month, the feds approved Idaho’s plans, which gives Idaho the authority to get back to work on the state’s NEVI project, Tomlinson said.
“Now that the NEVI Plan has been approved by the Federal Highways Administration (FHWA), we will gather as an interagency working group again in the near future to discuss what delivering the program looks like in Idaho,” Tomlinson wrote in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “This will be with (the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho Transportation Department).”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Three of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation members were ranked as “highly effective” lawmakers, according to a report. 
The Center for Effective Lawmaking analyzed the 118th Congress by party and chamber to determine who the most effective lawmakers were overall and by policy area. The Center is a joint partnership between schools at Vanderbilt University and University of Virginia.
On the Republican side, senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin and U.S. Rep. Tom Cole were highlighted in the report as being some of the most effective. 
The most effective lawmakers are determined by combining 15 metrics, including the number of bills sponsored, how far those make it in the lawmaking process and how substantial the proposals are, according to the report. 
Cole, who represents Oklahoma’s Fourth Congressional District and chairs the House Appropriations Committee, was ranked the third most effective House Republican. He introduced 20 bills and two became law. 
He was also named the most effective House Republican in the policy area of macroeconomics.
“I am a tireless advocate for the taxpayers, passionate about the need to produce a budget that can be utilized to defend our country as well as meet legitimate domestic needs, and willing to work in a bipartisan manner,” Cole said in a statement. “With that being said, I am so proud and honored to be named as one of the most effective House Republicans.” 
Lankford was ranked as the seventh most effective Senate Republican, a new addition to the top 10 list, according to the report. He sponsored 56 bills and two became law. 
He was also named the most effective senator of his party in the policy area of government operations. 
Spokespeople for Lankford did not return a request for comment by the time of publication. 
Mullin was named the most effective Senate Republican in the area of agriculture policy. His overall ranking among Senate Republicans was 37th. 
“As a lifelong cow-calf rancher, agriculture is truly a way of life for us in Oklahoma,” Mullin said in a statement. “In the Senate, I’m fighting to ensure our farmers and ranchers are heard in the legislative process. … While I appreciate the recognition as the most effective Senate Republican for ag, we’ve got more to do. I’ll always put our ag community first and do everything in my power to protect our rural way of life for generations to come.”
Here’s how rest of the Oklahoma’s all Republican congressional delegation also ranked for overall effectiveness: 

U.S. Rep. Frank Lucas ranked 35th of the House Republicans, 
U.S. Rep. Kevin Hern ranked 106th, 
U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice ranked 159th, and 
U.S. Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Oklahoma, ranked 169th.

Saying farewell to Wyoming is a hard thing. A WyoFile reporter bemoans doing it twice. 
The post A Wyoming goodbye, again appeared first on WyoFile .","I took this photograph in January, just days after moving back to Wyoming from California. 
It’s the view out the window above my desk in WyoFile’s Laramie office. After four years living in California, the visage this day, with snow on the roofs and sidewalks and the sun fading prettily behind the mountains, was a nice welcome home. 
The photograph contains within its frame much of what I love most about Wyoming — the quiet and the community. The rooftops and footprints remind me that beneath Laramie’s complications and contradictions lies the bedrock of a village mentality. It’s a place, like so many towns in Wyoming, where people have gathered together in the middle of an empty, often harsh landscape to build lives together.
Saying goodbye to Wyoming is a hard thing. When I left in the winter of 2021, I had spent five years at WyoFile, the start of my journalism career. I’d lived in Lander, Gillette, Cheyenne and Laramie and filed stories from most towns in the state, as well as a few from a mobile hotspot on a roadside. Leaving on Interstate 80, my heart tugged me backward. Driving west felt like post-holing through deep snow, with a hard-blowing Wyoming headwind to boot. 
One would have to be crazy to say goodbye to Wyoming twice. Alas, I am crazy, or at least restless, so come next week, I’ll be doing just that. In late October, I took a job at the Sacramento Bee covering California’s Legislature. It has been wonderful living in Wyoming again and working with the expanded and ever-more talented team at WyoFile, but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to write about one of the most-watched statehouses in the country. 
So soon enough, I’ll be packing my belongings and battling those headwinds and heartstrings back down Interstate 80, headed west on the highway I drove east on just a year ago. Who knows, maybe the local U-Haul dealer still has the trailer I rode in with. 
My stay this time around was far too short, but at least I packed in a lot of Wyoming. I wore out the tires on my truck chasing stories into Riverton, Rock Springs, Torrington and points in between. I watched the falling sun turn the walls of the Wind River Canyon pink after catching a hard-fighting rainbow trout — and losing more than a few. I bit my skis into untracked powder as I swooped through the silent forests of the Snowy Mountain Range. I clutched my suit jacket tighter around my body and cursed politicians, politics and the very idea of “the news” as I walked through the biting morning wind to the statehouse in Cheyenne. And I swung open the red metal door of a Laramie dive bar, stepping out of the winter night and into the good cheer of a room full of people I know and am fond of. 
So, I hate to leave you again. And who’s to say I won’t ask you to take me back again. But for now it’s goodbye again, Wyoming. There is, quite certainly, no other place like you.

Play for the Huskers,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/11/28/fast-path-to-nebraska-political-office-play-for-the-huskers/,NU sports grabs public attention and spur some student-athletes and coaches to starting roles in state politics,"Nebraska football players running onto the field at Memorial Stadium on Oct. 4, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Every home game, Memorial Stadium becomes Nebraska’s third-largest city for roughly three hours, as it will Friday against Iowa.  
Nebraska football and sports are as close to religion as the Cornhusker State’s people will allow. The university’s 85,000-seat stadium has sold out every home game since 1962, feeding more than $1 million in economic impact into the state every weekend the Huskers play at home.
Volleyball engenders similar levels of devotion, selling out the 10,000-seat Bob Devaney Sports Center and packing local restaurants and bars. But those two sports are hardly alone, as other Nebraska athletes know.

Playing for the Huskers also has its advantages in state politics. Several Nebraska athletics alums have run for political office, ranging from school and university boards to Congress and the Governor’s Mansion.
The house’s current occupant, Gov. Jim Pillen, is a former University of Nebraska defensive back, a former NU regent and a hog producer. But he is perhaps best known for recovering a game-sealing fumble against Oklahoma in 1978.
His first campaign for governor ran a biographical advertisement in 2022 recalling that moment in scarlet and cream. Nebraska earned an Orange Bowl berth with the win and shared the Big Eight football title with the Sooners. 
“And Beat Oklahoma,” Pillen said in the political ad. “I mean … lead the nation in job creation.”

Not all Big Red political candidates succeed, University of Nebraska-Lincoln political science professor Kevin Smith said, but playing for the Huskers gives them some “goodwill” at a time when public skepticism and cynicism reign. 
“We’re living in an era where expertise is mistrusted fairly extensively,” Smith said. 
The value of celebrity in politics isn’t new. 
Long before President Donald Trump revived belief in its power, there was former President Ronald Reagan, a movie star. Another west-coast movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, joined Reagan in serving as California’s governor. 
Even traditional politicians seek celebrity endorsements to reach different pockets of people in the hopes of boosting voter turnout. One recent example: Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign touted endorsements from Beyoncé, Leonardo DiCaprio and Taylor Swift, to name a few. Harris won Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Trump won statewide.

In Nebraska, the Huskers are local celebrities. And the list of current, past and potential candidates with ties to NU athletics is long.
Former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, a Republican candidate in Nebraska’s 2nd District for the U.S. House, was a backup quarterback for Nebraska from 1999 to 2003. 
Preston Love Jr., a defensive end in the early 1960s who was part of Nebraska’s Magnificent Eight, ran for the U.S. Senate twice in the past five years. The Democrat was the state’s first African-American U.S. Senate nominee of a major political party.
Jim McFarland, a tight end in the 1960s, served in the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 1986 and ran for governor in 1998 as a Democrat but lost in the primary.  
Hall of Fame college football coach Tom Osborne served three terms in the U.S. House representing the state’s rural 3rd district and lost a competitive GOP primary bid for governor in 2006 to an incumbent, Dave Heineman. 
Pillen, who still calls Osborne “coach,” played for the Huskers from 1975 to 1978.  Trump endorsed Pillen for reelection on Tuesday, and the president mentioned Pillen’s NU playing days in the endorsement.

Nebraska volleyball middle blocker Rebekah Allick was in a political ad for a successful ballot initiative that banned abortions after the first trimester in the state constitution, with exceptions for the life of the mother, rape, and incest. The ad also featured five Nebraska softball players, including pitcher Jordy Bahl.
“Out-of-state activists are pushing a radical amendment, Initiative 439,” Allick said in the ad. 
Allick, who is in her senior year at UNL, also attended the signing ceremony for State Sen. Kathleen Kauth’s bill that requires all student-athletes competing in public K-12 or college sports to play on teams that match their sex at birth. 
Former student-athletes Payton McNabb, a former high school volleyball player from North Carolina, and Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer, attended.

People at the time criticized the Husker athletes for participating.  Audrey Horn, a Planned Parenthood volunteer, told CBS affiliate KMTV that “Husker athletes are like celebrities. So [Protect Women and Children] are leveraging that name recognition, team recognition for their political goals.” 
Allick, speaking with the Examiner, said her experience with politics hasn’t been “great,” but said it’s more about her “faith,” adding that many student-athletes are scared to be political or speak on controversial topics because of the fear of losing sponsorships, popularity and even friendships.
“I have been told like ‘you shouldn’t use your platform,” Allick said. “‘You should just stick to talking about sports.’ But I’m a Christian. I’m a daughter. I’m a sister way before I was an athlete.”

Axiom Strategies Nebraska State Director Daniel Bass, who was directly involved in the ad, said the athletes appearing in the ad were motivated by their passion for the issue. 
“I can’t speak to their future plans, but they’d certainly have a bright future in public service,” Bass said. 
Part of the increasing value of celebrity in politics ties to the rise of populism. It has emerged as a driving force in today’s politics, as some voters have lost faith in institutions and seek alternatives. 
“Nebraskans have a great affinity for sports, and who’s a part of it … sometimes it can be really good [or it] can be a kick in the shins,” Pillen told the Examiner. “Just depends.”  
Pillen and nearly every member of Nebraska’s all-GOP congressional delegation attend most Husker games, as do many members of the Legislature. Former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., used to sell Runzas during Husker games.
Regular attendees include Republican U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, House Republicans Mike Flood, Don Bacon and Adrian Smith. Political candidates, including nonpartisan former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn has tailgated near the stadium. State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln, a season ticketholder, says he rarely misses a game.

UNL and other NU campuses provide access to a limited number of athletics event tickets to legislators as part of the university’s outreach as a state-funded institution, a connection that grows in value as state budgets get tighter. Athletics at UNL is self-funding, a rarity in modern college athletics.
Smith, the UNL professor, said a career in sports can only take people so far, as former players will eventually be judged by how they govern rather than their playing days, because politics is a “different ball game.” 
“Just because you’re good at one [sports], doesn’t mean that you’re going to be good at the other [politics],” Smith said.
Lindstrom, while in the Legislature, helped pass legislation that phased out taxes on Social Security income and pushed bills aimed at reducing income tax rates. He faced criticism for some of his votes, including on the death penalty and how to pay for road construction. 
Lindstrom told the Examiner he doesn’t know if he would be in state politics had he not played Nebraska’s football.
“There’s a lot of stuff behind the scenes that people don’t see with football and politics,” Lindstrom said.

Playing for NU helped Lindstrom prepare for interviews, stump speeches and debates, he said. He compared it to training in the off-season. Running for office takes discipline, he said, and campaigning takes a lot of teamwork — skills that he learned while playing football.
During his bid for governor in 2022, Lindstrom ran a TV ad that emphasized his “teamwork” as a Nebraska football player. It said he would bring “a new generation of leadership” to the state. He lost to Pillen, a fellow Husker alum.
Then and now, Lindstrom said he tried to avoid using his football experience as a selling point, because it could also be a negative, and he has government experience. He pushed back against his staff, who wanted to air a campaign ad for governor about him playing for the Huskers, saying it had been 22 years” since he played.
Smith, the UNL political science professor, said celebrity helps cut through a moment in politics when people distrust politicians.

Smith said the ways in which many people get their information also plays a role. Social media, for instance, has displaced much of traditional media for many.
As Sasse discussed during his most recent Senate campaign, people started treating party and political loyalty like their love of sports teams and religious affiliation, as non-negotiable loyalty tests that define how people interact with one another.
Said Smith: “We’re living in a highly polarized environment where people are increasingly taking politics as a core part of their identity.” 
This time around, Lindstrom plans to focus on his experience as a former state lawmaker, not his days playing for the Cornhuskers, in his bid to be the 2nd District GOP nominee against Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding. But people remember.
“We did it [for governor],” Lindstrom said. “Never again.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)When Thanksgiving rolls around, one thing Montanans pretty much all agree on is how lucky we are to be living in this incredible state.  As ecosystems and native species vanish across the globe, our mountains, plains, forests and rivers still support virtually all the fish, wildlife and native plants that were here when Lewis and Clark went through more than 200 years ago.  Given the largely degraded and degrading state of the rest of the nation and world, that’s pretty much a miracle — and one for which thanks is fully justified.
But of course, it’s not just the incredible landscape we call home for which to give gratitude.  In a nation facing intentionally planned political division and hatred of “the other,” Montanans aren’t irreparably split into opposing teams.  In large part that’s due to the very nature of where we live.  Howling winds, driving rains, temperatures dropping to well below zero and snowstorms that can dump feet in a day or less.
Montanans rely on each other far more than those living in concrete canyons shadowed by skyscrapers.  Here, no one asks what political party or “movement” you belong to before offering a hand to pull you out of a ditch, give you a hand hauling out an elk, or towing a boat with a bum motor back to the dock.  And that attitude, despite our differences of opinion on any given subject or issue, is what binds us all as Montanans under our Big Sky.
Yet, if gratitude is well warranted, so, too, is the flip side of that coin — which is the responsibility to maintain and restore for generations yet to come what we are so lucky to have been given.  And in that regard, public policy and the politicians responsible for developing and funding it are absolutely critical.
The simple truth is that Montana has been through the “rape and scrape” era of the state’s early years.  We still bear the deep scars left by cattle, mining, logging, and railroad barons and we’re still picking up the pieces and trying to put what was damaged and destroyed back together.
We took some hard shots, but we also learned the grim lessons of unregulated development and resource extraction, as reflected in our world-famous Constitution’s guarantees of the inalienable right to “a clean and healthful environment” and that “all lands disturbed by the taking of natural resources shall be reclaimed.”
While the visionary giants of the past are long gone, the benefits of the policies they courageously sponsored live on.  We still have wilderness — and the vast diversity of wildlife, fisheries and native plants that make their homes there. We still have wild and scenic rivers. We still have incredible national parks that are the envy of the world.
None of this was by accident. It took brave politicians who bucked the trends of their times, who stood up to the greedy extractive interests and their puppets in the state and national legislative arenas.
Now, with a flood of billionaires and developers bringing the next wave of destruction, pollution and irreparable damage to Montana, we need a few more brave politicians to see past their demands and “just say no” when the damages — particularly to existing Montana residents and landscapes — outweigh the dollars.
They’re coming for the rare natural amenities we still have thanks to the brave politicians of the past.  What we need right now are a few more brave politicians, those with the courage to say “Montana is not for sale” — and for which Montanans will be thankful long after they’re gone.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BigHole14-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-28 06:56:20.238641

(Courtesy of City of Omaha)OMAHA — An Omaha entity tasked with helping revive some of the most depressed neighborhoods in Nebraska is at odds with state officials it said are refusing to release $11 million in state funds needed for programming.
The Omaha Inland Port Authority, which was authorized by state law and created by the city to promote economic development in northeast Omaha, said it may have to turn to legal action. 
“It slows down our progress,” said State Sen. Terrell McKinney, who chairs the port authority board. “We had things on the table we wanted to launch.”

The North Omaha lawmaker, who helped champion port authority legislation, said the held-up funds should be boosting programming in the roughly 3,000-acre port authority district, including housing and entrepreneurial development. 
“It seems like an intentional effort to make things hard,” said McKinney. “It doesn’t make sense — if they want economic development in the state. I just don’t understand it.”
 ‘Sufficiently vague’ 

An Oct. 20 letter to the Nebraska State Treasurer’s Office outlines a back-and-forth that began in July, with the port authority requesting the funds it said it is due under law. 
Correspondence obtained by the Nebraska Examiner referred to a Sept. 24 response from then-Treasurer Tom Briese saying state law was “sufficiently vague that an immediate release of these funds to the OIPA would not be prudent.”
McKinney contends that there is nothing vague about the language, and he believes Briese, who was a former lawmaker, had consulted with other state officials.
He said Briese “blatantly refused to release the dollars … going against the state statute which clearly outlines what he is supposed to do.” 
Briese resigned as treasurer Nov. 3, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Fremont Mayor Joey Spellerberg to replace him, and Spellerberg was sworn in three days later.

The Examiner on Wednesday sought Spellerberg’s response to the standoff. Noting he was just settling in, he said he had talked that same day with OIPA executive director Garry Clark to set up a meeting about the funding.
The stalled funding comes as the State of Nebraska faces a growing, $471 million deficit. The Legislature is to begin its next session in January, with the Pillen administration and others on the lookout for budget trims.
Projects within the OIPA boundaries have faced some criticism in the Legislature. With installation of its inaugural nine-member board in June 2024, the port authority essentially launched. 
It oversees what many tout as the largest public investment of job and business creation in northeast Omaha’s modern history and has powers such as selling bonds to finance construction and infrastructure within its designated zone.
 Omaha mayor and Chamber CEO sign on

Clark was hired this past summer as the public entity’s first executive director. He is helping steer projects in the district, including a $90 million state-funded plan for a North Omaha business park and a $30 million grant from the state to seed an “innovation district.”
To help carry out Omaha operations, McKinney and then-State Sen. Justin Wayne, also of North Omaha, helped secure additional dollars for the Omaha port authority program by legislatively directing interest from state funding pots such as the Perkins County Canal and new prison projects. 
As a result, the board had expected to receive an $11 million installment in July — the funds the port authority says are being withheld.
‘Unlikely Viking’ foresees revival of Nebraska area ‘stopped in time’ 

The Oct. 20 letter to Briese was signed by Clark, McKinney, Carmen Tapio, a North Omaha business owner who chairs the OIPA finance committee, Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce.
The group asked that the interest funds be released by Nov. 3 and named the applicable statute that governs the process. 
“We are disappointed by your decision not to release these funds following our application sent on July 17, 2025. We are requesting a prompt response to hopefully conclude the matter without further delay.”
The group wrote that the state law provides for the grant award to be triggered by an application that is not subject to “further review” by the state treasurer so long as funds are available. 
“There appears to be no legal reason to refuse the award,” it said.
The group endorsing the letter said the Legislature has had “ample opportunity” to debate and amend pertinent language and “chose not to, respecting the compromises, negotiations and work to arrive at the final law.”

(Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)The city of St. Gabriel has zero major fast food chain restaurants, pharmacies or laundromats. But there are nearly a dozen chemical facilities within city limits and at least 30 within a 10 mile radius.
“We have bad smells here at night,” said Reginald Grace, 72, a retired counselor and lifelong resident. “Like a rotten egg, like chlorine.”
The air on a regular day in St. Gabriel is acrid — but many residents seem not to notice anymore. Grace has spent the last 10 years organizing residents against the growing chemical industry. The city is located in Louisiana’s infamous “Cancer Alley” — an 85-mile stretch of land between Baton Rouge and New Orleans home to over 200 industrial facilities along the Mississippi River, where the risk of cancer from industrial air pollution is the highest in the nation.
In the past few years, Grace said several of his neighbors have been diagnosed with or died of cancer. His wife of 41 years, Rhonda, had breast cancer, ovarian cancer and leukemia, which she died of in 2023, despite having no known family history of any of the three, Grace said. He added that he is in remission from prostate cancer.
St. Gabriel is home to the Syngenta agrochemical facility, which repackages a popular but highly toxic farming pesticide known as paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone before it is distributed to other states. The plant is owned by the Chinese company SinoChem Holdings Ltd.
A report released in October by Coming Clean, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and Pesticide Action and Agroecology Network warned of the dangers of paraquat exposure. Banned in over 70 countries, it remains one of the most commonly used chemicals by farmers in the United States for weed management — with the largest point of entry in the last eight years being the Port of New Orleans, according to Jim Vallete, a contributing researcher to the report.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that inhaling paraquat can cause lung damage. Some research shows that exposure to the chemical is associated with Parkinson’s disease, including a 2020 Louisiana State University study that concluded there was a greater risk of the disease in areas where pesticides, including paraquat, were used. There is currently litigation in Illinois federal court involving over 5,000 people suing Syngenta for alleged development of Parkinson’s from exposure to paraquat.
A sign for Syngenta’s facility, the agrochemical community at the heart of a recent study on paraquat, sits in front of a parking lot with industrial buildings behind it in St. Gabriel on Oct. 22, 2025.

An Environmental Protection Agency memo from 2017 noted that the chemical is so toxic that “one sip can kill.” The same memo said even minimal contact can cause serious injury to the eyes and skin.
The paraquat report includes several statements from farm workers across the country who have allegedly suffered harmful health impacts from exposure to the pesticide. Paraquat has also been linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, the report finds. From production to distribution to application, the report concludes that factory workers, port workers and farm laborers are all at risk of unsafe exposure.
Syngenta declined Verite News’ request to comment on its factory’s health and environmental safety regulations as well as the use of paraquat in Louisiana farming. The facility’s parent company’s home country, China, banned the domestic use of paraquat in 2016.
Human Rights Watch reported last year that Cancer Alley residents commonly suffer from respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic coughs and sinus infections. Migraines, miscarriages and dementia are also common complaints among St. Gabriel residents, according to Grace.
He added that he and other local activists — many of whom said they appreciate the close-knit community, childhood memories and laidback feel of the town —  are not asking for all of the plants to close down. They just want stricter monitoring of the impact on the environment.
“I’m not advocating cutting the plants out,” Grace said. “I know they’ve invested a lot of money into it, but what are you going to do, put money over safety?”

Made with Flourish

Ongoing debate on chemical safety
St. Gabriel incorporated as a city in 1994 partially to have more of a say against the growing chemical industry. The population decreased from a peak of 7,500 in 2020 but is once again growing as of 2022 according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Grace said the area has become popular with retirees from Baton Rouge looking for peace and quiet. Today, the population of roughly 6,800 must travel to the neighboring cities of Baton Rouge or Gonzales for jobs and many basic necessities such as medical care and fresh groceries.
“There’s nothing in this community. It’s a city, but there are no amenities,” Grace said. “People who grew up here, the children, don’t stay.”
Following the publication of the paraquat report last month, Verite News reporters visited St. Gabriel and the surrounding area to speak with residents about their ongoing efforts to minimize the harmful effects of living in an industrial hotspot.
Leroy Conish, 69, owns and operates a farm in Vacherie, downriver from St. Gabriel in St. James Parish. He’s aware that his farm is located in Cancer Alley and said he’s never used a product containing paraquat and aims to gradually eliminate the use of synthetic chemicals on his fields.
“We don’t really need to have the amount of chemicals that we use, because we can go back to farming the way our grandfathers and great-grandfathers used to farm,” Conish said.

Of the 10 acres Conish currently farms, roughly one acre contains no chemicals at all. Conish said once he learns how to make his model cost-effective, he wants to help bring about a farming revolution that helps low-income families in the area learn to sustain themselves in a healthy way.
Conish grows plenty of okra, which he said has antioxidants that he believes fight cancer — especially important “being in an environment that is filled with cancer emissions coming from every direction,” he said. Medical research has yet to conclusively prove that antioxidants do prevent cancer.
Many of Cancer Alley’s chemical plants are located in or near poor and mostly Black neighborhoods. As a Black farmer, Conish added that he believes chemical plants in the area take advantage of the region’s poverty. He wants to see greater regulation of the plants.
“Chronic poverty is a vestige of slavery,” he said. “Without chronic poverty, they wouldn’t have the opportunity to take advantage of poor people and promise them jobs, and I use the word ‘promise’ loosely.”
In a statement to Verite News, David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, called paraquat “a vital chemical to our farmers.”
“Farmers around the world have moved to adopt no-till farming, but this is only possible because herbicides like paraquat are used to control weeds while keeping soil undisturbed,” Cresson wrote. “It remains a widely utilized herbicide due to its fast-acting control of resistant weeds, compatibility with conservation tillage, and lack of residual soil activity.”
Herbicides are a type of pesticide that target weeds and unwanted vegetation.
Cresson added that U.S. regulatory agencies have reviewed scientific studies on the links between paraquat use and Parkinson’s disease and have not found a causal relationship. He did not address why 70 countries have banned the pesticide for health and safety reasons.
Navigating a shared space
Jan Drinkwater, 77, moved to East Iberville, just outside of St. Gabriel, more than 40 years ago. A breast cancer survivor, she said she was not informed of the air pollution in the area beforehand and wishes the agrochemical industry was better regulated.
“We have terrible odors from time to time,” she said. “This is current and frequent. … Why can’t they put that on the news?”
Drinkwater said as a resident, she should be made aware of what she is breathing. She added that despite the health risks, she still enjoys many enrichment activities at the St. Gabriel senior center and does not mind the lack of businesses in the city.
“I didn’t really move here for restaurants,” she said. “I wish it could remain rural … I would never want to go anywhere else.”
Melvin Craige, 75, has known Grace since childhood. Previously the director of St. Gabriel’s community center, Craige said he’s seen how the chemical industry contributes to the community by making investments such as refurbishing the community center’s weight room.
“When I was a director, they did all of the equipment and everything in the community center. They did a heck of a lot of programming,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Craige said he is also aware of scientific research pointing to links between the industry and medical problems facing residents.
“We just buried one of my cousins here Saturday who died of cancer,” he said.
Craige said he would like to see the community and the industry cooperate even more to monitor emissions to ensure better health conditions for the people of St. Gabriel.
One forum that the community and the industrial sector use to communicate on employment opportunities, safety and environmental concerns and industry expansion is the local community advisory panel. The East Iberville Community Advisory Panel has existed since at least the 1990s, and it currently meets every other month on Syngenta property, according to advisory panel members who spoke with Verite News.

Alex Robertson, 56, who has lived in St. Gabriel since his childhood, has been attending the panel’s meetings for about a year.
“We always sit back and complain, and we say what somebody is not doing, but the question is, ‘What are you doing?’” Robertson asked.
Robertson said he worked at the Koura plant in St. Gabriel for 30 years. Now retired, he remains a youth pastor at the Iberville Christian Center. He said his professional success is a testament to the industry providing well-paying jobs. He also said chemicals produced in the city contribute to everyday products Americans use to make their lives better.
But a recent Tulane University study showed Black Louisiana residents live in areas most affected by industrial pollution, yet make up the smallest portion of the industry’s workforce. Iberville Parish, where St. Gabriel is located, was shown to be home to the third largest share of the highest-paying manufacturing jobs in the state — but people of color were underrepresented among these positions.
Robertson joins the advisory panel’s meetings as a volunteer and liaises with the St. Gabriel City Council at public meetings on matters pertaining to the industry. He said he believes in the importance of the industry being a “good steward” to the community, by providing more high-paying jobs to local residents and offering educational opportunities — such as having plant engineers tutor kids at the local schools.
Good stewards should also not pollute the city, he said, and if they do, they should be upfront about it with the community.

‘The fight is not over with’ 
In addition to helping lead Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel, a local advocacy group, Grace sits on the board of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), an environmental not-for-profit.
Grace said one of his biggest wins against the chemical industry was in 2017, when he and Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel members successfully fought against Adsorbent Solutions, a local carbon reactivation plant that had sought to expand its operations.
“We told the council, if y’all do this, you’re killing your own people,” Grace said.
The St. Gabriel city council voted unanimously against the proposed expansion in April 2017. Adsorbent Solutions closed down its facility shortly after the vote.
Marylee Orr, founder and executive director of LEAN, has worked with St. Gabriel residents to advocate for cleaner air since the 1980s. In 2023, LEAN installed air quality monitors along the Mississippi River, but was unable to do so in St. Gabriel.
“We tried, we waited, we went through all the right authorities,” she said. “But the experience with St. Gabriel was that the public entities did not want the stationary monitor on their property.”
Orr said LEAN plans to expand the air monitoring project and has not given up on installing sensors in St. Gabriel.


Let us know what you think...


 

Lionel Johnson has been St. Gabriel’s mayor since 2011. Despite multiple requests, he did not schedule an interview to talk about public health, the economy and the proliferation of chemical facilities.
“He’s a coward,” Grace said. “He doesn’t mix well with people, but he’s highly educated, and he talks at people instead of talking to them.”
Grace’s son Kyle ran against Johnson in the last mayoral election in 2023, losing by only a slim margin. Kyle Grace’s platform centered on bringing more businesses to St. Gabriel, while Johnson focused on expanding city services.
Reginald Grace said he finds that much of the city has become “complacent” to the harmful health effects of the chemical industry.
“A lot of people are not educated to the fact that they can demand more,” he said. “They’re just trying to live from day to day.”
Grace said despite the health risks, he has remained in St. Gabriel all these years because of his family’s ties to the area and the difficulties of starting over somewhere new.
“I hope I live a few more good years,” he said. “Whatever damage has been done, it’s been done.”
Although the chemical industry has only grown in St. Gabriel, Grace said he urges the younger generation not to pack up and leave or cease their advocacy efforts.
“We’re trying to help the young people understand they have to get involved, they have to be educated and they have to work toward self-improvement,” he said. “The fight is not over with.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)Farmers across the nation are unlikely to be taking a check to the bank at the end of harvest — at least not checks big enough to cover their debt payments. But the government’s so-called remedies are a lesson in contradiction.
As statistics refute themselves, regulations harm more than protect, and trade barriers exasperate challenges facing domestic producers, the government’s role in farming is only adding to the red.
Government data ineptly grasps the financial condition facing farmers. On one hand, the United States Department of Agriculture predicts farm income will increase by 21.65 percent for 2025. But at the same time, direct government payments are expected to increase by 354 percent!
The government is confused by its own statistics and tactics. Despite improved net farm income, federal direct farm support is increasing while farms are dwindling. In all but Idaho, the mountain states exceed the national loss of 8.5% of farms between 2016 and 2024. Data clearly indicates that the numbers and/or tactics are overdrawn.
The only clarification comes for Midwestern farmers. According to the Federal Reserve of Kansas City, Midwestern farm lending activity expanded in 2024, with volume of new loans increasing 40% year-over-year. The story hasn’t brightened in the first quarter of 2025, with weakening agricultural credit conditions, while demand for farm loans continues to grow.
Unfortunately for Western farmers, the Federal Reserve of San Francisco only delivers a one-paragraph qualitative summary alluding to the assumptions of industry contacts. But local voices reiterate that the situation isn’t any better for the mountain states.
Fred Burmester, an Idaho hay farmer, said, “It was a really bad year last year. The commodity prices dropped a lot for us … and our production costs were close to the same.” Regarding an operating loan at 9.2 percent that Burmester took out, he said, “It’s going to take years to pay that back.”
State promulgated regulations also add to this financial difficulty for the mountain state region. In 2022, Washington experienced a 40% increase in farm-related expenses, thanks to the removal of the ag overtime exemption. 29.8% of these costs were attributed to an escalation in labor expenses, which had increased by 52% year-over-year. Another major contributor (10%) was expenses attributed to “marketing, storage, and transportation,” due to the carbon tax.
Tariffs exploit another vulnerability of the mountain states because of our reliance on imported agricultural inputs (like fertilizer) and the global retaliation toward American products. Idaho, Montana, Washington and Wyoming ship their agricultural products across the world, and these markets are not easily reclaimed.
The second Trump administration’s renewed trade war bounced the check on America’s farm resilience. These recent trade disputes revealed long-existing weaknesses in the agricultural economy. Long-term consolidation and anti-competitive trends among agricultural input suppliers have steadily pinched the agricultural economy. Now, in the face of tighter supply chains and global trade wars, the vulnerability of a low-competition system is apparent.
When 70 percent of each market space is controlled by 2-3 suppliers, the companies have less economic incentive to be responsive to one farmer’s needs. A recent Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing even listened to testimony on these trends. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa, chairman) said, “America’s farmers are the most productive in the world. They take the risk, put in the work and feed the United States and much of the world. But they also operate on thin profit margins.”
These thin profit margins are quickly giving way to overdrawn farm accounts, despite the USDA’s estimates that the average net farm income was above $80,000 in 2024. For anyone involved in agriculture in the last five years, very few “average” farmers deposited such sums in their bank accounts. Nor is a recovery expected in 2025, with a record corn harvest overflowing the silos and continuing the price decline.
Yet, the government’s efforts for recovery are more like a teenager with a credit card, rather than a responsible party paying down the debt. Poor data collection outside of Midwestern farms, increases in state regulations, disregard for anti-competitive behavior, and resumed trade disputes all continue to hurt farm margins.
We need policies that improve resiliency and decrease farmer vulnerability to government choices.

A new Roanoke College survey shows Virginians trimming holiday budgets this year while shifting more of their spending toward gifts. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginians plan to dial back holiday spending this year, trimming budgets by about 5% even as the broader economy shows strong growth, according to a new Institute for Policy and Opinion Research survey at Roanoke College.
The poll found that households expect to spend an average of $1,035 this season in Virginia — down from last year — and they’re shifting how they spend, putting more toward gifts while cutting back on personal purchases and experiences.
That pattern echoes national signals of caution. According to the latest Gallup poll, Americans expect to spend about $1,007 on holiday gifts this year, nearly unchanged from the $1,014 forecast last year.
Meanwhile, the Deloitte 2025 Holiday Retail Survey found U.S. consumers plan to spend an average of $1,595, a 10% drop from 2024, indicating restraint in spending on goods and experiences.
 A shift toward “core” holiday spending

The Roanoke College survey, conducted Nov. 9–14 among 912 Virginians, shows a clear recalibration. 
Planned spending on gifts is up 10.6%, while personal, non-gift purchases — such as apparel, electronics and home décor — are down 16.5%. Spending on experiences like dining out and entertainment is down 19.6%.
That shift toward essential holiday traditions mirrors national patterns: consumers preserving the emotional center of the season while scaling back discretionary extras. 
Analysts attribute this to price pressure, job market concerns and tariff-driven cost increases. 
“Holiday spending plans reflect a balancing act between optimism and caution,” said Dr. Alice Louise Kassens, senior analyst for IPOR and dean of Roanoke College’s School of Business, Economics, and Analytics. 
“While the economy shows strong headline growth, households are tightening overall budgets, reallocating dollars toward gifts and away from non-essential purchases and experiences.”
Income brackets also shape spending expectations in Virginia. 
Fewer households plan to spend between $100 and $500; instead more are at the low end (under $100) or high end (more than $1,000). Lower-income households are concentrated in lower spending tiers, while higher-income Virginians more often expect to spend above $1,000.
 Strong GDP, softer labor market

The new survey arrives against a complex economic backdrop. 
National GDP growth remains strong: the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model estimates annualized quarterly growth at 4%. That underscores consumer spending’s role — roughly 70% of the total economy. 
Yet households may not feel that strength. Year-over-year inflation is at about 3%, and labor-market indicators are showing softening relative to 2024.
Those conditions align with national consumer-sentiment readings. While spending intentions remain elevated, confidence is cautious. Tariffs are adding cost pressure in import-heavy categories such as apparel and electronics — items Virginia households say they’re cutting back on. 
In fact, “the continued shift to online shopping, accounting for more than half of planned holiday purchases, underscores consumers’ desire for convenience and value in a season marked by uncertainty. For small businesses, this trend highlights the importance of digital presence and competitive pricing to capture holiday demand,” Kassens said.
 Digital continues its climb

Digital shopping is now the dominant channel in Virginia. The IPOR poll found that 56% of planned holiday purchases will happen online, up four points from 2024. 
That mirrors national retail-industry forecasts: in the U.S., the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurants) of $1.01–$1.02 trillion this year — a 3.7%–4.2% rise over 2024. 
For Virginia retailers, that means refining digital offerings and value messaging could be key. “Consumers are celebrating the season, but with sharper priorities and a watchful eye on costs,” Kassens said.
Overall, the IPOR survey paints a picture of Virginians trying to reconcile the mixed signals of the current economy. While GDP growth is robust, price levels and job-market clouds are giving households reason to pause. 
Across the country, many shoppers say they plan the same or lower spending compared to last year: Gallup found 56% of Americans expect to spend about the same, 23% less.
Other national studies capture that same tension. Deloitte’s survey found 77% of respondents expect higher holiday prices and 57% anticipate a weaker economy in 2026.
Many are employing value-seeking behavior: trading down brands, waiting for deals, and making DIY or handmade gifts. 
“Retailers should anticipate strong demand for early online promotions, streamlined delivery options, and competitive pricing strategies as consumers seek value and efficiency,” Kassens advised.

Amid a number of contentious partisan debates, it can sometimes feel rare to find issues that lawmakers from across the aisle can agree on. But under the Georgia state Capitol’s gold dome — as in life — food often serves as a uniting force.
Lawmakers chewed on a number of food-related bills during the 2025 legislative session, spanning policies on lab-grown meat to which baked good is worthy of being Georgia’s official state bread. Here’s a few you should know.
Dinner with a side of foreign policy
As you sit down to eat this holiday season, your table may include an extra serving of Georgia state pride. Under a new law passed by the state Legislature earlier this year, two new dishes have become official state symbols, and the fourth Friday in November will be celebrated as “National Sugarcare Syrup Day.”
House Bill 233, introduced by Rep. Rick Townsend, a Brunswick Republican, designates Brunswick stew the official state stew of Georgia. The dish is generally made with a tomato-based sauce, beans, vegetables and meat — these days, most recipes call for chicken or pulled pork, but traditional Brunswick stew was historically made with small game meat, such as rabbit or squirrel.
Both Brunswick, Georgia and Virginia’s Brunswick County claim credit for the invention of the stew, in a rivalry that is unlikely to be settled by the passage of Georgia’s bill.
“Contrary to claims by other states, Georgia, and specifically Brunswick, Georgia, is the  birthplace of Brunswick stew,” the bill states.

Brunswick is also home to the annual Brunswick Rockin’ Stewbilee, which brings together stew lovers for a cooking competition, complete with live music, a car show, and a 5K race.
Ron Adams, one of the event’s founders and a longtime competitor, said that while there is a longstanding rivalry between the states, “it’s all been done, always with tongue in cheek and always in good fun, and nobody takes it too seriously.”
There are also a few regional differences between the two states’ versions of the stew, namely that Georgia’s Brunswick stew often contains pork, and tends to be chunkier than Virginian Brunswick stew. But at the end of the day, Adams added, each recipe is unique to the chef who cooks it.
“Brunswick stew has as many recipes as there are cooks,” he said.
Townsend’s legislation also includes a proposal from Rep. Kasey Carpenter to establish cornbread as the official state bread. 
Carpenter, a restaurant owner, said the variety of cornbread styles and flavors makes for a versatile, crowd-pleasing dish.
“There’s a lot of different flavors out there for people,” the Dalton Republican said. “Some people like jalapeños, some people like it sweet. The traditionalists don’t like it sweet. It’s pretty interesting, the diversity that’s out there.”
Though there was a small contingent of lawmakers who were vying for biscuits to become the state bread, Carpenter said cornbread was the natural choice for him.

“I like biscuits, but most people only eat a biscuit for one meal, people can eat cornbread for lunch and dinner,” he said, adding that cornbread’s Indigenous origins reflect the heritage of many residents of his northwest Georgia district.
“Cornbread has been made in the state of Georgia much longer than biscuits,” he said.
However, the revised bill was not immune from controversy. The Senate’s version included a measure that prevents state agencies from contracting with foreign adversaries such as China, prompting a wave of outcry from some Democrats who argued that the two issues should be addressed separately. 
The bill ultimately passed in a 113-51 vote, and was signed into law by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in May.
Both cornbread and Brunswick stew now join a list of Georgia’s edible symbols that includes Vidalia sweet onions (the official state vegetable), peaches (the official state fruit) and grits (the official state prepared food).
Next course
Lawmakers may have more food-related bills on their plate when they return to the capitol in January for the 2026 legislative session.
House Bill 65, introduced by state Rep. Angela Moore, would make collard greens the official state greens, and establish “potlikka” — a broth made from the boiled greens — as the official dipping sauce of the official state bread. For now though, the Stonecrest Democrat’s bill is stuck in committee. 
Other lingering measures are more serious and seek greater disclosure about the origins of the food we eat. House Bill 163, sponsored by Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley, requires restaurants to inform customers when they’re serving lab-grown or plant-based meat. The bill passed the House, and is awaiting action in the Senate committee.
Another measure, introduced by Savannah Republican Rep. Jesse Petrea, would require restaurants to disclose the country of origin for all imported shrimp served to customers. The bill, House Bill 117, passed in the House but was tabled in the Senate near the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Though areas like Savannah are known for their seafood, reporting from Grist and WABE has found that much of the shrimp served at local restaurants is actually imported from other countries. The bill, Petrea said, is “about saving domestic shrimpers, and it’s about letting consumers know that what they’re eating is imported.”
If the bill is enacted during the 2026 legislative session, Petrea said he hopes coastal Georgia will be able to strengthen its shrimp industry, noting that he has already noticed greater awareness around local shrimp since the bill was introduced earlier this year.
“Just since that time, we’ve seen an improvement in the sale of domestic shrimp in our area,” he said, adding that he expects the bill will cross the finish line next year. 
“I’ve already gotten a commitment from the lieutenant governor that it’ll be a priority,” he said.

As of Oct. 1, 16 state Medicaid programs covered GLP-1s for obesity treatment, up from 13 last year, according to a survey of Medicaid directors by KFF, a health policy research group. But some states have announced they will discontinue coverage or restrict who can qualify for it.
Many doctors and patient advocates say the drugs will save money in the long run by reducing obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Many states, however, have concluded they just can’t afford them.
North Carolina Medicaid ended coverage of GLP-1s for obesity last month, citing shortfalls in state funding. California, New Hampshire and South Carolina have said they will end coverage on Jan. 1. Starting next year, Michigan Medicaid will limit coverage to people who are “morbidly obese.” Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin also are considering new restrictions.
In last year’s KFF survey, about half the states said they were interested in covering GLP-1s for weight loss, according to Elizabeth Williams, a senior policy manager at KFF who focuses on Medicaid. This year, most states are moving in the opposite direction.











This likely reflects recent state budget challenges and the significant, significant costs associated with coverage.


– Elizabeth Williams, KFF senior policy manager



“This likely reflects recent state budget challenges and the significant, significant costs associated with coverage,” Williams said. “After a number of years of robust revenue growth right after the pandemic, states are starting to see slowing revenues, increasing spending demands and a lot of fiscal uncertainty due in part to recent federal actions.”
In April, the Trump administration scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Earlier this month, Trump announced that his administration had reached agreements with the manufacturers of Wegovy and Zepbound to reduce the prices of the drugs for Medicaid, Medicare and consumers buying the drugs directly, But it’s unclear whether the deals will reduce costs for states.
Health plans for state workers also are reassessing their coverage of the drugs for obesity. North Carolina, for example, ended GLP-1 obesity coverage for state workers last year, and West Virginia canceled a 1,000-person pilot program.
GLP-1 medications, which balance blood sugar levels, have long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. All state Medicaid programs, which are funded jointly by the states and the federal government, cover GLP-1s for those uses.
But the drugs also curb hunger signals and can help people lose significant amounts of weight. Medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound have become wildly popular for that purpose.
Between 2019 and 2023, the number of outpatient Medicaid prescriptions for select GLP-1s to treat diabetes and obesity grew from 755,300 to 3.8 million, according to KFF. During the same period, Medicaid spending on those drugs increased from $597.3 million to $3.9 billion.
A study published last year in The BMJ, the journal of the British Medical Association, found that the number of patients without diabetes who started GLP-1 treatment in the United States increased from roughly 21,000 in 2019 to 174,000 in 2023, or more than 700%.
Biden wanted Medicaid to pay for weight-loss drugs. Trump just said it doesn’t have to.

More than 2 in 5 U.S. adults have obesity, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC defines obesity as having a body mass index — a calculated measure of body weight relative to height — of 30 or higher. Obesity costs the U.S. health care system almost $173 billion per year, according to the agency.
Recently, the manufacturers of some GLP-1s have lowered their prices, selling them directly to consumers for $500 or less per month. But many patients cannot afford to pay that much out of pocket.
States in a tough financial position
In North Carolina, Dr. Jennifer McCauley, a weight management physician at UNC Health, said Medicaid coverage of GLP-1s was “incredibly helpful for our patients.”
“Now they’ve stopped coverage, so those people are now going back, regaining some of the weight, because they’re unable to obtain these medications, and also are suffering the health consequences of obesity,” McCauley told Stateline.
Some critics of expansive GLP-1 coverage say it isn’t cost effective, because many patients gain back the weight they lost when they stop treatment. But McCauley said the “downstream effects of obesity are even higher.”
“There are definitely vulnerable populations that probably would not be able to obtain weight loss without these medications.”
James Werner, a spokesperson at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, blamed the coverage change on the state legislature’s failure to budget enough money for Medicaid.
In an email to Stateline, Werner said coverage of GLP1s for weight loss “would be reconsidered if Medicaid is fully funded.”
Some states are trying to maintain at least some coverage of the expensive drugs by tightening the eligibility requirements for a prescription, according to Colleen Becker, a project manager at the National Conference of State Legislatures, a policy research group.
“States are really looking at how to balance access and provide that access to patients, but they’re stewards of their budgets, and they need to be good stewards of it,” Becker said.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states considering such options. Meanwhile, Connecticut has decided to maintain coverage of weight-loss drugs for state employees, but to require beneficiaries to try online weight-loss counseling before they can get a prescription.
Some future possibilities
One state, North Dakota, has taken a different approach to GLP-1 coverage after legislation that would have required the state’s Medicaid program to cover the drug failed. Instead, North Dakota this year became the first state to mandate that insurers on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace cover the drugs for weight loss.
North Dakota Deputy Insurance Commissioner John Arnold said the insurance department calculated that the mandate wouldn’t cause insurance premiums to rise significantly.
“It’s not that anybody can walk into the doctor’s office and say, ‘Hey, I want to have this covered,’” Arnold said. “It is really for those who have a medical need for the drugs, then it would be covered.”
The insurance department had to ask the legislature for permission to make the change, according to North Dakota Republican House Speaker Robin Weisz. He said insurance carriers were concerned that it was going to be “open season for everybody who could lose 20 or 30 pounds.”
He said it will take time to see whether the policy raises insurance premiums.
“If the carriers can come in a couple years and say, ‘Wow, here’s what we’ve spent on these … we’ll take a hard look at it,” Weisz said. “But, it’s way too early to tell at this point.”
Arnold says other states may have the flexibility to consider mandating ACA insurers to cover the drugs.
“Our biggest concern was reducing those comorbidities and the long-term impact that that has on the cost of insurance in general, because more comorbidities means more claims,” Arnold said, referring to diseases and conditions associated with obesity.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-28 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Federal grants for Yale research on malaria were cut, but the work continues",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/yale-malaria-research-federal-cuts/,"Federal cuts to research have had real-world effects. But for one Yale researcher, the work has continued with alternative funding sources.","Amy Bei, a professor of epidemiology at Yale University, received the cancellation notice from the federal government on May 1. 
The $300,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health was for the first phase of research into a method for tracking malaria spread through communities. Bei had been finishing up that first phase when the notice came through. 
It wasn’t Bei’s first brush with federal funding cuts to research this year.
In January, she’d received a stop-work order from the federal government for a separate project in the central African country of Chad, where she was helping local laboratories introduce new technologies and build capacity for genomic surveillance across the country. She was told she could keep working temporarily on a limited basis, then she received the official cancellation notice in June. The project was funded through the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. 
Bei’s grants are only two of many at Yale and other Connecticut universities that have been cancelled or paused — or for which funding is expected to run out and not be renewed.
According to Lindsay DiStefano, the University of Connecticut’s interim vice president for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, the school had lost $41 million in cancelled grants and nonrenewals as of mid-October. The university has been able to provide about $1.6 million of its own money in the short term for certain projects, according to DiStefano. 
Michael Crair, Yale’s vice provost for research, said 50 grants had been cancelled as of Aug. 12. An additional 22 were either partially cancelled or ordered to pause, and 14 more were told they would not be receiving future funding. Crair said the cancellations amounted to “tens of millions of dollars” in research funds. 
“The loss of federal funding has delayed, halted, and put at risk research essential to advancing life-saving medical breakthroughs, scientific discovery, humanitarian aid, and technological innovation, among other important work,” Crair wrote in an emailed statement. 
Real-world effects of laboratory cuts
At Yale, Bei has been researching malaria spread in Africa since the early 2000s, when she went to Tanzania to study drug resistance and evaluate potential candidates for malaria vaccines. She said the experience changed her life.

“It really made me realize, this is not just a problem that we’re trying to tackle in a Petri dish, but this is truly a disease that has a just unbelievable toll in communities,” she said. 
Bei said when she began working in the field, the medical interventions to fight malaria were limited, and people were getting very sick. Although there’s been a lot of scientific progress since then, Bei said, the parasite has adapted to evade interventions like vaccines and medications.
“Whether you look at death, you look at morbidity, you look at days lost from school, or days lost from going to work, there’s so many different impacts that malaria has on everything from loss of life to even loss of being able to live and be a productive member of society,” said Bei. 
According to data from the World Health Organization’s 2024 report, Senegal reported about 1.2 million cases of malaria and 200 deaths from the disease in 2023. 
Malaria is a parasite, which makes it particularly challenging to vaccinate against. The parasite goes through different life cycle phases and displays genetic variations, making it difficult to narrow down a single target that can be used to protect against all infections. When it reproduces inside a human being, Bei said, the new parasites can appear differently in the body than the ones the mosquito originally transmitted, making the disease unpredictable for anyone trying to develop a vaccine. 
The biomarkers Bei’s project was researching, which originate in a mosquito’s saliva, have several uses. The presence or absence of certain biomarkers can indicate whether government interventions to prevent malaria spread — for instance, widespread distribution of mosquito nets sprayed with bug repellant — are actually preventing people from being bitten. 
The markers are particularly useful in geographic regions where most people aren’t showing symptoms of malaria, but the disease is still being transmitted, Bei said. As people become accustomed to the parasite, they are able to contract it without experiencing symptoms, hiding the fact that the disease may still be alive and well within particular communities.
“We have these areas of the country, and this has actually happened in Senegal, where you think there’s very little transmission going on, but actually there’s sustained transmission that is just kind of going under the radar, or because people are not coming in in a symptomatic way to clinics, but yet they’re still transmitting the parasite between individuals,” said Bei.  
Bei said a future goal would be to develop biomarkers that can distinguish between different types of mosquitos spreading the parasite.

Finding ways to continue the research
Since the grant cancellations, Bei said she’s gotten funding from the philanthropic arm of Tito’s Handmade Vodka to continue some parts of the NIH-funded work tracking malaria spread. 
Tito’s philanthropic arm and a few internal grants from Yale have also enabled her team to keep up the USAID-funded project in Chad, including a training her lab is offering on using genomic surveillance — observing how parasite genomes evolve in response to malarial interventions — to track malaria. 
Still, the loss of funding was disruptive. 
Natasha Turyasingura, a Ph.D. student from Uganda who is working on the Chad project, said she was planning to travel to Africa this past February to train local researchers in how to use a newly developed DNA sequencing panel to analyze the genetic makeup of malaria parasites found in blood samples that researchers collected from different parts of the country.
With a new vaccine recently available, the scientists were trying to understand ways the parasite might evolve to escape the effects of the vaccine, as well as forms of malaria that don’t appear on diagnostic tests or have become drug-resistant. 
But the U.S. government’s order to stop work on the project postponed the trip by nearly a year, as Bei searched for funding to continue the research. With those funds now secured, they plan to travel to Chad in December.
For Turyasingura, the Trump administration’s new priorities have also hit her personally. The length of her visa was shortened from one year to three months, making it more challenging for her to travel and conduct research outside the U.S. 
Meanwhile, other facets of the project in Chad were thrown into limbo. Efforts to meet with village representatives and community members to educate people about the benefits of vaccination, which were being supported through the USAID grant, are now severely limited. 
Bei also continues to relieve additional NIH funding for an effort to develop a “next generation” malaria vaccine. 
The World Health Organization recently approved two vaccines, one in 2021 and one in 2023, to be used in countries where malaria is widespread. But Bei noted that the vaccines have a low rate of efficacy. According to a 2024 World Health Organization paper, the 2021 vaccine was between 45% and 51% efficient in preventing malaria, and the 2023 vaccine was between 66% and 75% efficient. And that protection decreases over time.  
(By comparison, the vaccine commonly given for measles is 97% effective after two doses.)
Laty Gaye Thiam, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal, which collaborates with Yale on the malaria research, said the vaccine they are developing will attempt to complement existing vaccines by targeting a different stage of the parasite’s life cycle. As part of this work, he said, they are looking at the antibodies produced by people who are immune to the disease and identifying the antigens that those antibodies are responding to, in order to understand what factors are protecting those people from the disease. 
Bei said they planned to combine the research that Thiam and others in the lab are doing with her biomarker research to create a broad “panel” that will give researchers more information about malaria spread. 
Thiam, who is originally from Senegal, said he’s seen firsthand the damage caused by malaria. He’s had it himself several times. 
“Having suffered from that, and also being close to kids and infants that are suffering … from our field work, it is really a devastating disease … You can see that it has a huge impact, not only on the child who is sick, but even the mother or the dad who’s carrying that sick child. You can feel the burden of the disease.” 
Cyrianne Keutcha, a Cameroon native and postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Public Health who works in Bei’s lab in Senegal, said she remembers coming down with malaria around age 11. It was a case severe enough to keep her in the hospital for two weeks.
Keutcha is working with Thiam on the research into next generation malaria vaccines. She is testing whether a potential new malaria vaccine developed in the United Kingdom will be effective against the parasites found in the blood of people who are living in places like Senegal, where malaria is prevalent. Keutcha is looking to see if any natural variations in these parasites can escape the effects of the potential vaccine. The vaccine in the UK is in the early stages of being tested on volunteers. 
Keutcha said that much of the research they were doing on malaria could also be used to understand other diseases, ones that are prevalent in the U.S. 
“You are investing in knowledge that can significantly improve the wellbeing of a group of people that you may not know. However, that same technology can be used to significantly improve your well-being as well for another disease that is to come or that’s already present,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4336-1024x672.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 05:56:41.755994

With those words, Republican candidate for governor Charlotte O’Hara launched into her answer to my question: Why write and publish dozens of personal political columns on her campaign website?
“I think that many candidates speak in platitudes and they don’t speak in specifics,” O’Hara said this week. “That’s a real tradition. Candidates don’t want to dive into how they would approach a problem.”
The earliest versions of her political commentary likely started around 2008, when O’Hara (who was then the 3rd District Republican chairwoman) remembers sending out commentary pieces in a newsletter to state delegates. O’Hara now co-owns an Olathe business that manufactures plastics, including casino poker chips.
Her public life also includes past work as a state representative and Johnson County commissioner.
“When I was a county commissioner, I also did columns,” O’Hara said. “So I mean, this is not just because of the campaign. I think it’s just a great way to communicate with people. Most politicians don’t want to be that open with all of their opinions, but I think that the more that the community knows about you, that’s what you really want. It’s important for people to understand where you’re really coming from.”
O’Hara’s writing is certainly specific. Dozens of columns showcase her conservatism, both fiscal and social.
One headline asks, “Men in Women’s YMCA Locker Rooms?” She kicks off with these lines: “We have been so blessed with beautiful spring days. The season of the world awakening from winter’s rest. Now, if only we would awaken to God’s creation of Adam and Eve.”
In “Why is Kansas the High Tax Point on the Prairie?”, a sentence shows her mix of personal writing and focus on specifics: “As a commissioner, I voted no on giving a Chinese company, Cnano, property tax incentives at New Century AirCenter of 30 cents a sq ft. or approximately 12% of what they should be paying.”
O’Hara told me: “People know who I am. There’s not going to be any doubt about that. I pretty well lay everything out there. I’m not hedging anything when I write about an issue. I put it out there, what I think.”
Poetry and music are also avenues for O’Hara to express herself. She has written and performed seven albums of songs on Spotify, including her favorite song, “Last Lullaby.”
She has collected her poetry into a self-published book, “I Wonder.” Part of a poem she wrote this week includes these lines: “Or doomed are we / To be buried in this deluge / Of illusion’s complexity / And lost from our grasp, / Simplicity.”
O’Hara says that Doug Johnson, a political friend, edits her columns. She calls him “a political buddy. We have been in the trenches of politics for the last 30 years.”
Political cartoons accompany each column. O’Hara’s friend Tim McCabe provides caricatures (see Gov. Laura Kelly with blue hair and rainbow pride earrings) and symbolism (see Panasonic as Jabba the Hut gobbling cash) at the top of each page.
The bombastic combination of commentary and cartoons leaves readers — and voters — with a clear impression. As O’Hara says: “Boy, she’s conservative.”
O’Hara’s commentary appears in a few places: on four pages of her website, through an email list and on her campaign’s Facebook page.
“I think it’s just important that I communicate with the people on Facebook,” she said.
Three hundred and forty days before election day for Kansas governor, most candidates competing with O’Hara have campaign websites. The basic formula is a red, white and blue logo. Plus a bunch of family photos. Plus a few basic planks of your platform.
Some websites are spartan — just a single page. (I’m looking at you, Jeff Colyer.) Learning about the candidate’s political thinking can require watching a campaign video.
O’Hara’s writing puts her more clearly on the record. While I don’t agree with most of her writing, I admire her willingness to explain specific misgivings with how Kansas is being governed.
Sometimes, those positions situate her in an unorthodox political niche. She bemoans tax breaks for companies, which she calls corporate welfare. She blames both Democrats and Republicans for approving these tax incentives.
On the topic of President Donald Trump, O’Hara says the legislative branch needs to reassert itself to maintain power, pushing back on executive actions like the recent tariff increases.
“President Trump loves to consolidate power,” O’Hara said. “That’s just how he operates. And it’s not just him. This has been going on forever, but the Congress needs to be big boys. Put their big boy pants on — or however you want to put it. They need to recognize that they have a responsibility for doing their jobs.”
After writing more than 170 columns for Kansas Reflector, I can struggle to find a weekly topic. In fact, this week I asked two editors at the Reflector for inspiration.
For O’Hara, finding a topic is simple, she says.
“It just seems like that they just show up on my front porch,” O’Hara said. “I am a woman of deep faith, and so I pray a lot. They show up on the front porch, and I start writing about them.”
In fact, O’Hara had advice for me at the end of our interview.
“I would just encourage you to be more on autopilot,” she said. “See where your imagination and your creativity takes you. Instead of just (saying), ‘OK, this is who I’m writing for.’ No, it’s an honesty. This is what I’m thinking. This is an important issue that people need to think about. Here’s a different perspective.”

In the hush before dawn, ordinary men and women declared that kings were notdivine, that power was not sacred, that liberty was not to be begged for but claimed.The Revolution was not merely a war of muskets and tea — it was a covenant ofconscience, a vow that no tyrant would sit enthroned above the human soul.
Yet every generation must renew that vow. For democracy is not a relic secured in marble; it is a flame that must be fed — or it dies.

Carlton Highsmith
And so again, as in every age before, the ancient question rises from the dust: When the powerful demand our silence, do we appease — or do we oppose?
Appeasement always comes dressed in reason. It speaks softly of prudence and patience, of compromise and calm. It promises peace in our time — and delivers ruin in its wake.
In Munich, 1938, a man waved a paper and called it peace. A year later, the world was burning. Chamberlain’s mistake was not political but moral — he mistook cowardice for wisdom, and fear for diplomacy. He believed evil could be reasoned with, that tyranny could be tamed by tenderness. But history is clear: authoritarianism does not bargain. It consumes. And long before Munich, America knew that truth.
When the Kansas-Nebraska Act sought to spread slavery westward, Charles Sumnerrose in the Senate and named appeasement for what it was — “cowardice maderespectable.” For his words, he was beaten nearly to death, yet his voice still echoes while his assailant’s name has turned to dust.
In every age, moral clarity is punished before it is praised. When fear swept through the 1950s and Sen. Joseph McCarthy hunted ghosts, it was the courage of journalists and citizens — not the comfort of the crowd — that saved the nation’s soul. Edward R. Murrow stood before the camera’s eye and declared, “We cannot defendfreedom abroad by deserting it at home.”
And when Martin Luther King Jr. was told to wait, to quiet his march toward justice,he answered from a Birmingham jail that the greatest threat to liberty was not the Klansman’s rage, but the moderate’s silence — that “negative peace” which prefersorder to righteousness.
These are not shadows of the past; they are reflections in the mirror we face today.Once more, the drumbeat of authoritarianism sounds — this time cloaked in flags,cheered on by cynicism. We are told dissent is disloyal. That truth is a matter of opinion. That judges are political, the press deceitful, elections corrupt. That the Constitution is too fragile for the moment it built.
But let us remember: Silence is not prudence — it is surrender. Democracy does not collapse in a single blow; it decays through a thousand small surrenders. Tyranny does not storm the gates; it seeps beneath them.
It begins with the normalization of lies, the ridicule of truth-tellers, the corrosion oflaw, and the soft numbing of the public conscience. It seduces the weary with promises of safety, simplicity, and greatness — and in exchange, steals the very freedoms that make greatness possible.
The Constitution was never written to protect the powerful. It was written torestrain them.
James Madison warned that “ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”Our duty, then, is not to obey — it is to resist when obedience becomes complicity.Reinhold Niebuhr reminded us that evil cannot be disarmed by politeness, onlyconfronted by courage. Appeasement is not humility — it is the quiet betrayal of justice dressed in civility’s robe.
History’s verdict is unwavering: democracy survives not by the silence of thecautious, but by the courage of the convicted. It dies not from one great blow, but from the slow corrosion of conscience.
The patriots of 1776 were branded traitors before they were hailed as founders. The marchers of Selma were called agitators before they were canonized as heroes. Courage is always condemned before it is celebrated.
Appeasement offers comfort for a day, regret for a lifetime. Opposition demands sacrifice now — but bequeaths freedom to the generations. The question before us is no longer philosophical. It is moral. It is urgent.
The threat to democracy is not distant — it is domestic. It creeps in through cynicism, apathy, and fear. And so the duty falls, as it always has, to those who still believe — who still dare to speak when silence feels safe.
Let us, then, be counted among them. Let us answer history’s summons not with resignation, but with resolve. Let us rise — not in anger, but in allegiance to the idea that birthed this nation: that free people must never bow to fear. To appease is to abandon. To oppose is to affirm. Silence has never guarded liberty.
Every right we hold dear — to speak, to vote, to worship, to dissent — waspurchased not by the timid, but by the defiant.
The eyes of history are upon us now. The test is before us. And the verdict — as ever — will be written not by our intentions, but by our courage.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The holiday light show at Montgomery County’s Brookside Gardens is open for about a month and a half. But preparing for the show, which involves 1.5 million twinkling lights, is pretty much a year-round affair.
Practically right after each year’s show finishes in early January, staff members are already thinking about the next iteration of the popular event, said Jeff Patterson, the facilities and grounds manager at the garden.
“We’ll have a wrap-up meeting, and then [it’s]: What do you want to do for next year?” said Patterson, who’s in his 24th year setting up the show.
Brookside Gardens is not alone. Throughout the state, drive-through and walk-through light shows have become winter holiday mainstays that require hundreds of man-hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up every year.

In Maryland, popular shows take over parks, gardens, fairgrounds and farmland, beginning some time around Thanksgiving and extending past Christmas and often into the New Year.
The coronavirus pandemic reportedly boosted the concept’s popularity, with stir-crazy quarantined Marylanders eager for outdoor activities that allowed for social distancing.
The Garden of Lights show at Brookside, which is set up by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, has drawn 44,000 visitors each year, on average, dating back to 2022. Before that, tickets were sold per car, rather than per person, making prepandemic comparisons difficult. But anecdotally, COVID provided a boost, Patterson said.
“It increased visitation for a few years, for sure,” he said.
During a recent workday, with the show just a few weeks away, workers used zip ties to affix lights to a large tunnel, decorated to look like a caterpillar, that visitors will walk through near the visitor center. A second crew assembled another tunnel of lights in the yew garden, on the other side of the 50-acre garden within Wheaton Regional Park.
For the Brookside show, which opened Nov. 21, the design work begins in January, after which materials are ordered and then an in-house welder assembles the metal structures the hold the lights.
Patterson said the crew makes slight modifications to the show each year, largely adding more and more attractions, based on what set-ups are popular with attendees. Last year, the team added a group of pink flamingos near a lake in the gardens, Patterson said.
“That was a huge hit,” Patterson said. “So, this year we added palm trees and a whole bunch of other stuff out there.”
Producing this year’s show included a bit of a wrinkle: Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump (R) on goods entering the U.S. from China and other nations drove up prices on the raw materials and light bulbs that have to be purchased for the displays in the early part of the year. Patterson said prices changed so frequently that staffers had to check repeatedly before making purchases.

“We have price limits on what we can spend, being a government agency,” Patterson said. “So, we had to cut back some on supplies, because we had to pay a tariff. And that — I’d never seen that before. So, instead of buying 20 lights, we were going to buy 18 lights, because we had to pay that extra money in tariffs.”
The show’s overall budget is in the hundreds of thousands each year, Patterson said. Admission is $13.99 Sunday through Thursday and $16.99 on Fridays and Saturdays. Children 5 and under are free.
At Brookside, a crew of about a dozen seasonal workers begins assembling the displays in August, first putting together the metal silhouettes for the lights, and then shortly thereafter pulling the lights from four shipping containers, where they are organized by color.
During the off-season, some of the larger metal forms are stored beneath tall roof structures, including a giraffe and tall trees.
“It keeps adding and adding as the show keeps growing,” he said.
The show has also changed over the years. First came the transition to LED lights from incandescent bulbs, a time-intensive process that took place around 2015, Patterson said.
“It took us quite a few years to get all the forms done, because they were all incandescent,” Patterson said. “You have our giraffe, which has the most lights on it, that took three weeks to strip and redo.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The next big thing is displays that are controlled through cellphone apps, which spurred another transition for the staff at Brookside.
“That was a struggle at first — the learning curve of: ‘Oh, we have to get WiFi in the garden now to run all these things,” Patterson said.
The light show is hardly Patterson’s only job. As grounds manager, he also oversees irrigation, custodial crews and more. But it has become a significant part of his day-to-day.
“It’s a huge undertaking, and it takes almost every section here to make it work, from advertising to budgeting to all of our banners and signage we have to put up, and online ads,” Patterson said.

Library of CongressNine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.

But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.
Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined a lawsuit alongside 21 other state attorneys general against the U.S. Department of Agriculture over guidance issued by the department.
The lawsuit said the new guidance would eliminate eligibility for legal immigrants who had previously been eligible to receive such benefits, including those who had been granted asylum or refugee status.
The guidance, issued at the end of October, was intended to provide instructions on how to implement program changes passed in July as a part of H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowed eligibility for noncitizens.
“The guidance in reality goes beyond the act, arbitrarily excluding from SNAP many lawful permanent residents who remain eligible under the statutory scheme established by Congress,” the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Oregon Eugene Division said.
Nothing in the bill, the filing continues, would prohibit individuals who were at one point refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees, now groups no longer eligible for SNAP, from gaining eligibility for the program if and when they gain status as lawful permanent residents. 
“The law is clear on who can receive SNAP benefits, yet the Trump Administration is trying to strip rightful recipients of the support they need to feed their families,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. “It is my hope that the Court puts an end to this unlawful guidance and stops the White House’s ongoing chaos and confusion over Americans’ ability to put food on the table.”
The lawsuit is seeking an injunction to the changes that would prevent states from implementing the eligibility changes in question.
Nessel and 20 other attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last week asking for clarification on the new guidance, but they did not receive a response from Rollins.
The lawsuit also alleges that the U.S. Department of Agriculture misapplied its own rules on new regulations about SNAP error rates within states — the legislation passed in July gave a 120-day window for states to address their error rates, but the guidance issued in October stated that the window for that exclusionary period would end on Nov. 1 — a Saturday, one day after the guidance was issued. 
The calculation was done based on the day of the passage of the bill initially, not when the guidance was issued, which Nessel and the other attorneys general argue is incorrect based on federal laws.

President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration in mid-September. The storms the declaration covered happened May 18-22. At least 50 homes were destroyed in southeastern Montana during the storms and water supply contamination was also an issue.
“One of our core responsibilities at HUD is to help rebuild homes, businesses, and communities after natural disasters,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a press release. “We are supporting the Crow Tribe of Montana by providing financial flexibility and disaster recovery resources to those impacted by the recent disasters.”
In a press release Wednesday, HUD noted several options for those impacted by the disaster.
Recipients of Indian Housing Block Grants and Indian Community Development Block Grants can apply for necessary waivers and flexibilities for disaster relief. 
Additionally, there’s a three-month moratorium on foreclosures.
“A 90-day moratorium is issued on foreclosures of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as foreclosures of mortgages to Native American borrowers guaranteed under the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee program,” the press release said.
The move also allows individuals to finance the purchase or refinance of a house, along with its repair, through a single mortgage, the release said, adding homeowners can also finance the rehabilitation of their existing home if it’s been damaged.
There’s also further flexibility for those in various federal housing programs.

If not for a series of tones broadcasting her location, no one would’ve known she had died.
Like dozens of other Yellowstone National Park wolves involved in a three-decade-long study, researchers collared wolf 1331F as a pup in 2021 to track her movements. Gray with ribbons of brown fur fading into her pale muzzle and legs, the young wolf lived with the Wapiti Lake Pack, one of the largest in Yellowstone.
Wildlife photographer V.C. Wald watched 1331 supervise black wolf pups hunting a wounded bison on the shore of the Firehole River in the winter of 2023-’24. Easily visible from the road, the pups tried to take the bison head-on, only to scatter as it bluff charged. Then, 1331 demonstrated how to approach the massive ungulate more safely from behind, nipping at its hind quarters, Wald recalls, “[she was] a teacher, of young wolves, and of me.”

The scene isn’t out of the ordinary for the Wapiti Lake Pack, whose territory encompasses Yellowstone’s sagebrush-covered Hayden Valley in the center of the park. They chase elk and bison. They play and sun themselves on cold winter days. Much of this activity occurs under the gaze of humans. But every now and then, pack members leave the park.
In late 2024, Yellowstone Wolf Project telemetry data suggest 1331 started a journey away from her pack. She headed north. First, she spent time around Mammoth Hot Springs. Then she crossed the park’s boundary into Montana. While tourists often lined roads to watch 1331 and her packmates inside the park, wolf watchers are sparser in the rugged and mountainous mix of public and private land just north of Yellowstone. Wolf 1331 had no way of knowing, but she’d crossed an invisible line where the national park gives way to state rule. It’s a consequential threshold: Wolves are protected from hunting on one side, but can be legally killed by gun, trap or snare on the other.
Park officials don’t know if 1331 was permanently leaving her pack or if she would have eventually returned to Wapiti Lake’s territory; it’s not uncommon for female wolves of her age to disperse for days or even weeks leading up to breeding season in February — sort of a lupine rumspringa. But they do know she’d left the pack far behind. On Jan. 24, 2025, staff with the Yellowstone Wolf Project drove north of the park, wielding bulky telemetry equipment to listen for collared elk and wolves. They heard 1331’s signal, indicating she’d moved farther into Montana than ever. But, the beeps suggested, she hadn’t budged in at least 12 hours.
Park staff turned the information over to Montana’s fish and game agency. Wolf 1331 would ultimately be found dead in a trap set by a prolific wolf hunter who manages a large ranch about 10 miles north of Yellowstone. The man who trapped 1331 would receive a warning for violating state trap-check laws and no other punishment. Her journey had come to an end roughly a month after it began.

The Yellowstone bubble
Wolf 1331F’s fate was unusual only in that she made it so far north. When wolves leave the park, they die — often, quickly.
Yellowstone’s roughly 100 wolves are among the most famous and beloved in the world, attracting throngs of wolf-admiring tourists who spend tens of millions of dollars in the region every year. However, protected by federal law and tolerant of their adoring fans, Yellowstone wolves are uniquely vulnerable to hunters and trappers in surrounding states where killing wolves is legal. Their destinies are often shaped by which of the three surrounding state boundaries they cross.

“When we look at the fate of collared wolves that leave Yellowstone, most commonly they don’t survive the next hunting season,” Yellowstone Wolf Project leader Dan Stahler said in a May 2024 interview.
Heading into Wyoming, wolves encounter wilderness and tightly controlled hunts, but greater danger beyond. Step into Idaho and it’s a free-fire zone, though few wolves go that way. Journeys north into Montana are the most common and have proven the most deadly, despite some state efforts to take it easy on park wolves.
Yellowstone’s wolves die from hunting and trapping outside the park every season, but things seem to be getting worse. From 2009-2020, about 4.3 wolves from Yellowstone were killed legally by hunters and trappers each year, according to National Park Service data. From 2021-2024, that number nearly tripled when an average of 12.75 wolves died annually, according to Yellowstone Wolf Project data.
It was clear to Doug Smith, retired lead of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, that the park’s porous boundaries would be an issue almost immediately after wolves were reintroduced in 1995. “This is a long-term problem for wildlife management, and particularly wolves,” Smith said in an interview this fall.
Inside Yellowstone, wolves are managed “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” the now-famous language adorning the top of Roosevelt Arch, a striking stone gateway often surrounded by selfie-taking tourists at the park’s North Entrance. The sentiment springs from the 1916 act creating the National Park Service and stops at the park’s border. Outside Yellowstone, the states take over wolf management. There, wolves can get into trouble. They kill livestock, the occasional pet, and lots and lots of elk. And they’re especially naive to the many dangers in the new world around them.

Even in the early days of reintroduction, Smith remembers phone calls urging him to do the impossible: keep wolves inside the park. Back then, wolves had federal protections both in and out of Yellowstone. Hunting them was illegal, whether in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho, or inside Yellowstone itself. But within a month of releasing the park’s first wolves from their enclosure, a hunter named Chad McKittrick illegally shot and killed a male wolf, numbered 10M, after it left the park and ventured onto private land near Red Lodge, Montana.
Fast-forward nearly 30 years and death also awaited 1329M, a striking green-eyed black male wolf, when he left Yellowstone. Researchers captured and collared 1329, born into the Wapiti Lake Pack just like 1331F. He was caught and joined the ranks of research wolves in 2021, the same year they collared 1331F as a pup. A year later, park scientists documented the young male, with a touch of silver on his chin, getting into a scuffle with other males, which could have spurred a dispersal. His collar’s GPS data shows he left Yellowstone on May 14, 2022, heading south. “[1329] beelined it all the way down through the trophy game wolf area,” said Stahler, the current Yellowstone Wolf Project leader.

The state of Wyoming tightly regulates wolf hunting in an area where wolves are managed as “trophy game” adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, with the area closed to hunting in the spring. But 1329 kept moving. GPS data shows his route, loping straight through the heart of Jackson Hole, then south, looping through the Wyoming and Salt River ranges. The black wolf headed into a valley where, three years later, Sublette County resident Cody Roberts would fight a felony animal cruelty charge for allegedly making a public spectacle of a wounded, juvenile wolf in a bar before the animal died. The incident made international news and divided the small Western Wyoming community. Wolves are fewer here. There’s a reason.
Within two weeks of leaving Yellowstone, the roughly 2-year-old 1329 crossed another boundary and left Wyoming’s regulated wolf “trophy game” area for its “predator zone,” which covers 85% of the state and where there are virtually no regulations on how wolves can be killed. Running down and bludgeoning wolves with snowmobiles here is legal. The departure meant he could be killed any time of year, by almost any means, and without a license.
Toward the end of June 2022, wolf 1329 stopped moving in the mountains near Salt River Pass, near where the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem transitions into the Great Basin. He’d stepped into a steel-jawed leghold trap. “It had been in the trap about four days,” Stahler says, “based on the location and movement.” By June 26, the trapped wolf was dead. The Yellowstone biologist’s best guess is that 1329 was exposed to the elements and died of dehydration. States surrounding the park require trappers to frequently check their wolf traps to reduce animals’ suffering and minimize harm to non-target species. Negligence is illegal.

‘Risky life choice’ 
Wolves in the Northern Rockies are no strangers to controversy. Indeed, politicians in all three states surrounding Yellowstone have long seized on wolves as a prime example of federal overreach. “I remain seriously concerned with the uncertainty that continues to surround Yellowstone wolf reintroduction as it moves forward,” former Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in 1995, after wolves were already on the ground. Former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter said he’d be the first to bid on a wolf tag back in 2007. And Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte was issued a warning for killing a Yellowstone wolf without the proper trapper education in 2021.
Death by hunting, trapping or wildlife management official is the most common fate for wolves that leave Yellowstone National Park. Even in a natural system, the act of dispersing is already a “risky life choice,” according to Stahler. Solo wolves end up in territories of other wolf packs, where they clash and get killed. In fact, within Yellowstone, wolves are the leading cause of wolf death.

While the number of wolves that spend the vast majority of their time inside Yellowstone has stayed relatively static for more than two decades, wolf populations outside the park have grown by leaps and bounds. That’s in part because some Yellowstone wolves successfully dispersed and survived. At the same time, other wolves reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness established and bred. And yet more wolves filtered down from the north, crossing the Canadian border into the U.S. Today, populations of animals as reclusive as wolves are tough to estimate, but the most recent figures for Montana and Idaho wolf populations are roughly 1,100 and 1,200, respectively. In Wyoming, which has less mountainous, treed habitat, there are fewer wolves — about 350 — and they’re counted with much greater precision.
While those wolf populations outside the park grew, the human population inside Yellowstone expanded, too. Park visitation hovered around 3 million annually at the time of wolf reintroduction in 1995. Today, that number is closer to 5 million, evidenced by the sprawl of souvenir shops in the Yellowstone gateway towns of Jackson, Wyoming and Gardiner, Montana where tourists snap up T-shirts, stuffed bison and elk toys, and art emblazoned with wolves. This increased visitation, wolf biologist Smith says, is the biggest issue facing Yellowstone National Park as a whole.
“It’s the best place in the world to view wild wolves,” says Smith, adding that in the early days of wolf reintroduction, finding wolves inside the park was exclusive, inside information. That’s changed nowadays, he says, with the influx of eager, wolf- and grizzly-watching tourists. “There’s no inside tips anymore. Just look for the traffic jam.”

Wolf-watching tourism alone contributes at least $82 million annually to communities bordering the park, the most recent data show. However, all those people lining the roads and hillsides of Yellowstone come at a cost. “[When wolves] leave the park,” Smith says, “they get shot because they stand there and look at a hunter.”
Some wolves become so accustomed to people that they become habituated, according to Smith, meaning they walk up to humans in search of food or become so bold that they run off with tripods. In rare instances, park officials have euthanized habituated wolves.
The Wapiti Lake Pack, a major draw for wolf watchers and tourists, has been susceptible to human conditioning. These Yellowstone interior wolves, considered bison-killing specialists, often use groomed park roads to get around in winter, at times walking right by snowmobilers buzzing down the road on their way to places like Old Faithful or Tower Junction. They’ve even been hazed with paintballs as a result.
But the vast majority of park wolves aren’t habituated, Smith says. Rather, they’re tolerant of people. “A wild wolf is avoidant,” he says. “They flee, they run. They know what humans mean: death. That’s not a park wolf.” Tolerance is the curse that leaves them vulnerable outside the park.

Justin Webb, executive director of the Foundation for Wildlife Management, says Yellowstone should do more to instill its wolves with a healthy fear of people.
“Wolves in the park should be given the respect of space, and I think that those wolves shouldn’t be conditioned to people,” says Webb, whose nonprofit makes bounty-like payments to trappers who kill wolves.
On occasion, Yellowstone wolves face circumstances that make them especially prone to human conditioning. The Junction Butte Pack, for example, often dens within eyeshot of Slough Creek, a popular trailhead for hikers and anglers. Tourists and Yellowstone guides have learned about the highly visible location, potentially dooming those pups.
“Why don’t they close the trailhead down?” Webb asked.
Yellowstone wolves leave the park for all kinds of reasons. Some, like 1331F, might take a temporary solo hiatus from their pack, while 1329M was likely in the midst of a more permanent dispersal, searching for new territory or a mate. However, the vast majority of Yellowstone’s wolves spend about 96% of their time inside the park, collar data shows. With no time to learn a healthy fear of humans, the 4% of the time they unwittingly leave their protections behind proves deadly. Instead of other wolves, people — either hunters or poachers — become, by far, the leading cause of death for wolves that depart Yellowstone, Stahler said.

No fear
For the first decade and a half after wolves returned to Yellowstone, the Endangered Species Act outlawed hunting wolves throughout the Lower 48. Protracted legal battles meant the first lawful hunt didn’t occur until 2009, and it revealed the risk facing wolves that spend most of their lives inside Yellowstone.
“They aren’t showing any fear,” one Montana wolf hunter told the Los Angeles Times after a successful hunt that year. “But they will, I’m sure.” Another hunting guide told the outlet about a wolf his client killed: “He was no more afraid of [the hunter] than the man in the moon.”
In 2011, wolves were permanently “delisted,” or stripped of federal protections under the Endangered Species Act, in Montana, Idaho and portions of three other western states by an act of Congress. In Wyoming, the change came more slowly because of litigation. Wolves were most recently delisted there in 2017.

After years of hunts in surrounding states, the story hasn’t changed much. In late 2024, members of the 8 Mile Pack crossed the park boundary into Montana. Three hunters were waiting. They left with four dead wolves. A fifth was found days later, dead in nearby bushes. That many wolves dying at the same time rather than fleeing at the sound of a gunshot, Smith says, likely means they had no fear of people. “Killing multiple wolves at once is a sure sign of that.”
In this way, 1331 and 1329 are outliers. According to Yellowstone National Park data, over the last few years, approximately 81% of wolves that lived in Yellowstone and were killed by hunters died in Montana. That’s largely due to terrain. Think of the Gardiner Basin just north of Yellowstone like a funnel: Elk migrate to the lower-elevation, arid area in search of forage in winter. Wolves follow. Of all those wolves killed by hunters in Montana, nearly 9 in 10 died within just a mile of the park boundary. The forays of 1331 and 1329 outside Yellowstone — clocking about 10 miles and over 100, respectively — mean they traveled much farther than most of their kind before meeting the same end.

The lives of long-distance travelers, like the two Wapiti Lake pack members that died in traps, are less understood. Smith attributes the dearth of data to a simple reason: They die.
“A wolf dispersing has a higher mortality risk because it doesn’t know the landscape,” he says. “So that makes it more vulnerable to getting shot because they’re wandering around going, ‘I don’t know where I am; I don’t know where it’s safe and where it’s unsafe.’”
Montana and Wyoming’s respective wildlife management agencies investigated the trappings of 1331 and 1329. Both were found only because of their collar mortality signals, and both trappers were found to have violated state “trap-check” laws. Wolf traps must be checked every 48 hours in Montana. Leghold traps must be checked every 72 hours in Wyoming’s predator zone, the only place in the Equality State where wolf trapping is allowed.
The Wyoming trapper, a Cokeville resident named Ezra Cluff, was cited and fined $250 on June 30, 2022. “Cluff stated that he had got busy and had indeed failed to do his trap checks on time,” the warden wrote in a citation slip. Cluff did not respond to an interview request.
Nearly three years later and on the opposite end of the ecosystem, 1331 was found in a trap about 10 miles, as the crow flies, north of Yellowstone. The trap was registered to Matt Lumley, who was at the time president of the Montana Trappers Association and vice president of the National Trappers Association. Lumley also has close ties to political leadership in Montana. He helped Gov. Gianforte trap and kill another collared Yellowstone wolf in 2021. Gianforte later described Lumley as his wolf hunting “mentor” in an interview with Lee Enterprise’s Statehouse Bureau. In addition, Lumley is a founding member of the Outdoor Heritage Coalition, a group currently suing Montana, arguing that state wildlife managers aren’t setting policy aggressively enough to reduce the wolf population.

Lumley did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But his comments in the Helena Capitol building are in the public record. “I’ve killed a lot of wolves,” he testified at the Montana Legislature just days before Wolf Project staff heard 1331F’s mortality signal. “I’ve never killed a Yellowstone National Park wolf. I’m killing all my wolves in Montana.”

Matt Lumley, the trapper whose trap wolf 1331F was found dead in, was issued a warning by Montana FWP. The Park County attorney declined to prosecute.

Yellowstone park officials estimate that 1331 died on Jan. 16, 2025. Park staff detected her mortality signal on Jan. 23, and her remains were recovered even later. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks submitted a “request for prosecution” for a trap-check violation to Montana’s Park County Attorney’s Office. Despite the state’s 48-hour trap-check regulation for wolves, the county attorney declined to prosecute.
“After a careful review of the reports, supporting documents, and available evidence, we determined that the facts did not establish a criminal offense that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Park County Attorney Chad Glenn said in an email to Mountain Journal and WyoFile.
Glenn did not respond to follow-up questions or provide the documents he cited as the basis for his decision. Ultimately, Lumley walked away with a formal warning from FWP. Gianforte also walked away with a warning in 2021 after running afoul of trapping regulations while killing a wolf with Lumley on the same ranch, owned by Robert E. Smith, a co-director of Sinclair Broadcasting Group and contributor to Gianforte’s 2017 congressional campaign.
Elk, livestock and wolves
The saga of Wapiti Lake’s wandering wolves reflects the complexity of managing Yellowstone wolves when they leave protected areas like the park. Over the last few decades, the region has transitioned from an economy based on resource extraction to one heavily reliant on tourism and recreation. Outside the national park, wildlife managers are tasked with balancing hard-to-reconcile viewpoints in states where hunting and ranching have deep roots and large landowners hold sway.
The overpopulated elk herds of Yellowstone’s Northern Range numbered around 15,000-20,000 in the years leading up to the 1995 wolf reintroduction. Counts are now closer to 5,000, much to the dismay of many a hunter who relied on the area’s abundance of ungulates for meat or trophies.
“I’ve got an 18-year-old son that I want to get to experience elk camp in the backcountry,” Webb, the wolf-hunting advocate, told a Wyoming audience in 2022. “I want him to sit on a mountaintop on a ridge and listen to bulls bugle below him as the sun comes up, and I believe that if we don’t do something to control wolf populations, he won’t have that experience.”
Wolves push an elk herd in Yellowstone. Biologists say wolf packs have contributed to the decline in Yellowstone elk numbers over the last 30 years since they were reintroduced to the park, but many also say that the elk population before wolves returned was greater than the area’s carrying capacity. (Matt Metz/National Park Service)
Meanwhile, Lumley the trapper called the decline of southwest Montana elk “the greatest loss of hunting opportunity in the world” during the same legislative hearing he touted killing “a lot of wolves.” Decades before wolf reintroduction, elk were so numerous in the area that Yellowstone sometimes culled thousands of the animals in a single year. Later, the park took a more hands-off approach. Elk hunting outside the park became the primary management tool to deal with the overpopulated ungulates. Locals recall a “firing line” of hunters as elk moved toward winter range outside the park’s protections.
Wolves were a factor — but not the only factor — in the region’s decline in elk numbers. Mountain lions and bears eat elk, too. And so do people. A long-running late-season elk hunt in the Gardiner area also played a role in the elk population’s shrinking size. Despite a drastic decrease in numbers from the days before wolves, elk populations north of Yellowstone still remain at or above the state-set goal for elk numbers. Access to elk is yet another important part of the hunting puzzle. Some hunters say the wary ungulates that remain in the area often take shelter from wolves and hunters alike on private land, making them next to impossible to pursue.
Part of the tension around hunting both wolves and elk also centers on economics. While wolf-watching brings millions of tourist dollars into communities surrounding the park, outfitters north of Yellowstone have lost business as elk herds declined after reintroduction. The lawsuit filed by the Outdoor Heritage Coalition features outfitter Craig Neal, an outfitter in Townsend, Montana, as a plaintiff. Neal, the brief contends, “has been negatively impacted by restrictions on wolf hunting in Montana from a personal and economic perspective … his business opportunities are limited by the insufficient wolf quotas and reduced elk available for hunting.”

Elk aren’t the only hooved creatures wolves impact, either. Outside Yellowstone, they also occasionally kill livestock. Although wolf-killed cattle and sheep are a drop in the bucket among the many factors that kill domestic livestock, the impacts aren’t trivial for individual ranchers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
In Wyoming and Montana each year, wolves typically kill at least a few dozen of the more than 3 million cows in the two states — though many ranchers argue that wolf kills can go unproven since remote carcasses are consumed before the kill can be documented. Depredation numbers in Wyoming notably spiked from 2014 to 2017, topping out at 121 wolf-killed cattle — a pulse of conflict that coincided with the three years Wyoming wolves were relisted under the Endangered Species Act. While those federal protections prohibited hunters from killing wolves at the time, wildlife managers trying to avert conflict could do just that. And they did, killing a record number. In Montana, complaints about wolves eating livestock peaked at 233 in 2009. Since then, in the wake of delisting, the number of reports has dropped off drastically, hovering at 100 or fewer annually from 2015 to 2024.
Pressure cooker 
To control the wolf population and mitigate their impact, hunting has become a fixture of wolf management in the Northern Rockies. Since legal seasons began earlier in the century, some animals that spend most of the year in Yellowstone are always lost to hunters’ bullets and traps outside park boundaries.
In an attempt to resolve the tension between the park and surrounding states, Montana carved out small areas with more limited hunting called “wolf management units” directly north of the park. Wyoming tightly controls its hunts immediately adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and has had minimal overall impact on Yellowstone populations. Idaho takes an aggressive, statewide approach to wolf hunting and trapping, but the topography and location of Yellowstone packs have limited its influence on park populations.

The vast majority of harvested Yellowstone wolves die in Montana, where tensions continue to flare over setting the state’s wolf season. In 2021, the Montana Legislature mandated a reduction in the state’s overall wolf population, numbering roughly 1,177 at the time. The new law simply set a minimum of 15 breeding pairs (corresponding to 450 wolves). In the years since, setting policy to reduce wolf numbers has fallen to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, a citizen board appointed by the governor, currently Gianforte. The commission has considered a slew of ways to meet the mandate: lengthening hunting and trapping seasons, instituting a statewide quota, night hunting on private land, and neck snaring, among other approaches. Some of those aggressive tactics have taken effect. Others haven’t. Yet today, four years after the legislative mandate took effect, Montana still hasn’t seen a meaningful reduction in its wolf population.
In 2021, about six months after Gianforte trapped and killed a Yellowstone wolf north of the park, the commission also removed quotas in the wolf management units, or WMUs, just outside Yellowstone. That winter, hunters killed at least 25 wolves that spent the vast majority of their lives inside the park. Roughly 1 in 5 park wolves perished — more park wolves than in any hunting season before or since. Yellowstone biologists worried about the impact of the hunt on their three-decade-old research project — some packs dissolved due to the hunt, and others formed. Behavior and reproductive rates changed, too. Wildlife guides were furious, concerned they’d lose business or wolf-watching opportunities altogether.
Ultimately, the quotas were restored. But over the next two years, outcomes for Yellowstone wolves only marginally improved. At least 13 park wolves were killed in the 2023-2024 hunting season. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly voiced his concern to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission in a 2024 letter. “Wolves that primarily live within Yellowstone are exceedingly valuable to a great number of people across Montana, the country, and the world,” he wrote. “The park generates hundreds of millions of dollars in additional economic activity to Montana economies and wolves and other wildlife rate as a top reason why people visit the park and region.”
The pressure cooker of hunting policy around Yellowstone hasn’t let off steam. At the January 2025 legislative hearing, Lumley complained that the Fish and Wildlife Commission was setting policy that was too protective of wolves and listening only to out-of-state interests, particularly Yellowstone. Just 3% of the national park lies in Montana. “That’s what you are elected to do, protect Montana’s interests,” Lumley testified. “Not Yellowstone National Park’s.”
In a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting months later, Chris Morgan, Lumley’s successor at the Montana Trappers Association, made similar claims. He alleged that policy safeguarding wolves in the region around Yellowstone is a “political ploy” and touted the state’s responsibility for wolf reduction rather than wolf watching.

“We don’t have any state mandate that requires us to make sure that ecotourism thrives,” Morgan said. “Our mandate is to reduce the state’s population of wolves. Plain and simple. Period.”
Wolf advocates were just as fired up in the day-long meeting. Cara McGary, a Yellowstone guide and cofounder of Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition, argued that plenty of Yellowstone wolves — like 1331F— die even outside the protective boundaries of the wolf management units. Southwest Montana receives far more wolf hunting pressure than anywhere else in the state, despite a lower overall wolf density than Montana’s northwest corner, according to Montana FWP data. It’s also the only area in the Treasure State where the wolf population was already on the decline. In 2024 alone, at least six wolves from the park died legally in the Yellowstone-adjacent WMUs and another five outside their boundaries. “That’s almost 10% of the product that our businesses depend on,” she testified.
At the time of publication, wolf hunting season in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho is well underway. The heat over wolf hunting regulations around Yellowstone in that August commission meeting led to something of a middle-ground approach. But already this year, a Montana hunter legally killed a Yellowstone wolf beloved to the wolf-watching community, which described the dark black 1479F as playful and tolerant of crowds.
“She was one of the few wolves in the park that would walk right through a crowd of people to reach her destination,” wildlife photographer Deby Dixon told Cowboy State Daily.

The year of the wolves





Infamous wolf captor Cody Roberts pleads not guilty, trial set for March




The National Park Service has two chief goals: preserving and protecting natural systems, and visitor enjoyment. Wolves figure into both, and the scientific gains from studying Yellowstone packs are unparalleled: They’re both uniquely visible and, at least in theory, uninfluenced by humans. But as wolves deal with such direct mortality when they set paw outside the park, Smith wonders: “Do you have a natural wolf population or not?”
Some data suggests not. A 2023 peer-reviewed study led by then-University of Montana PhD student Brenna Cassidy found that Montana’s wolf-hunting regime has a clear effect on the overall survival of Yellowstone wolves. Without hunting, park wolves have a nearly 90% chance of surviving any given year, but the rate falls to about 80% when hunting occurs with quotas. When there’s unlimited hunting outside the boundary, Yellowstone wolves’ chances of surviving a year dip closer to 70%.
Smith, Yellowstone’s retired wolf biologist, wants to be clear: He’s a hunter as well, and a self-described “gun guy.” At times, though, he worries that all the focus on Yellowstone’s wolves has an overlooked downside. It sucks the air out of the room in wolf management conversations, leaving too little focus on the thousands more wolves in Montana and the rest of the Northern Rockies that don’t have the same vocal proponents as animals in and around the park. Those wolves die too — often very quickly or brutally. In Montana, hunters and trappers can take a total of 458 wolves this season, including six in the WMUs outside Yellowstone and 60 in the larger region where 1331 met her end. There are no limits in Idaho, and it’s a wolf hunting free-for-all in Wyoming’s predator zone, where 1329 died in an illegally monitored trap.
Thinking about intense hunting pressure throughout the Northern Rockies, Smith thinks wildlife managers should consider a bigger question: “Where do wolves get to be wolves?”

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 26, 2025.
Hyde Park Electric ratepayers are bracing for a 20% increase in their electric bills following the revelation that their municipal utility is struggling under a mountain of debt. Meanwhile, a neighboring utility manager has stepped in to try to right the ship as every option is on the table — even the potential dissolution of the utility.
The double-digit increase will take effect in the new year. It was imposed as the first part of a two-phase rate case approved by the Vermont Public Utility Commission to allow Hyde Park to keep the lights on as the state and the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority attempt to untangle its knotted finances amid significant financial distress.

In October, Hyde Park Electric’s long-simmering financial crisis came to a boil as its inability to cover expenses became known to the state. It was originally estimated that the small municipal utility, with 1,400 customers, was carrying $1.5 million in debt. After a few weeks of forensic accounting by the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, that number has climbed to $4.5 million.
Shortly after news of Hyde Park Electric’s financial crisis broke, former village manager Brian Evans-Mongeon resigned. Evans-Mongeon bore the brunt of the Vermont Department of Public Service, which advocates for ratepayers, and its attempts to push the village of Hyde Park to face the seriousness of the situation. Even though village trustees had discussed the future of his position with the town, Evans-Mongeon resigned on his own volition, according to Fredericka French, chair of the Hyde Park Village Board of Trustees.
With a VPPSA employee now installed in the Hyde Park office, Morrisville Water & Light manager Scott Johnstone has been tapped to step in to take the helm in Hyde Park village. A former secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, Johnstone has led the neighboring municipal utility since 2022.
Last Thursday, Johnstone held a public question and answer session prior to the trustees’ regular meeting. Frustrated ratepayers crowded into the village’s low-slung office building situated across from the imposing brick facade of the Lamoille County Courthouse.

Johnstone told village electricity customers that this phase-one rate increase is only the beginning — he said a 20% percent increase is what it will take to keep Hyde Park Electric’s and its customers’ lights on. How much ratepayers will have to pay to keep the utility solvent will be determined next spring, following completion of phase two of the rate case.
Johnstone said this increase catapulted Hyde Park into the top five for the most expensive electricity among the state’s 17 electric utilities.
Customers were also eager to learn how the utility could go about addressing the $4.5 million debt. Johnstone said most of the debt seems to have been accrued through operational costs and taking on more debt to cover other expenses.
Johnstone and the trustees are already working to determine what parts of the debt can be refinanced. The solar arrays the town has also invested in, which now contribute significantly to its debt load, could potentially be offloaded.
The village might also look at some of its other assets, including the French family home. It was donated to the village in 2013 by the nine French family siblings, including Fredericka French’s husband, Ed, with the intent of seeing it become the village offices, but the small municipality was never able to secure the funds for its renovation.
Johnstone warned ratepayers that the process of determining what was prudent for Hyde Park ratepayers by the Public Utility Commissions could become a contested one.
Some in attendance at last week’s meeting wondered who to blame. Prior village managers have managed the water, wastewater and power operations, but the publicly elected, volunteer board of trustees ultimately made the decisions.
Johnstone said that, at this point in the financial analysis, he could say with a certain amount of confidence that there had been no embezzlement that contributed to the insolvency. He said it was, rather, a general mishandling of funding.

French pointed out that, prior to 2016, the village was debt-free. It was only after state-mandated upgrades to the water and wastewater system, and new investment in renewable energy, that the debt began to mount. She said she was waiting to learn more about how exactly the village found itself in financial disarray before passing full judgement, but acknowledged that everyone in a leadership position bore some fault.
“I’d say there’s plenty of blame to go around,” she said. “I don’t really have any full answers to that at this point, and I think I will once we get all the information.”
Consolidation question
Hyde Park Electric’s insolvency has raised new questions about the long-term viability of the small municipal utility.
In a report updating the Public Utility Commission on the investigation into the utility and efforts to stabilize it — filed by Hyde Park Electric and the Department for Public Service — a “potential future steps and discussions” provides the two options on the table: Hyde Park Electric returns to solvency under new leadership and continues to exist, or it “merges with or is jointly managed with another municipal entity or utilities.”
Such discussions won’t take place until well into next year at the earliest, and Hyde Park Electric could consider other neighbors like Vermont Electric Co-Op or Green Mountain Power, or another municipal utility, for partnership or consolidations. However, Johnstone’s arrival in Hyde Park emphasizes the closeness in proximity of Morrisville Water & Light as a potential partner.
Johnstone is also currently interim director at the Hardwick Electric Department and, he said, if only because managing a public utility is difficult, the town of Hardwick is considering a merger with Morrisville Water & Light.
Should it come to pass that both Hardwick and Hyde Park consolidate under Morrisville Water & Light, the utility would serve over 11,000 customers, rivaling Washington Electric Co-op in the size of its customer-base. Johnstone, though, took care to emphasize that such discussions were a long way off, and that his focus was on the crisis at hand.
Through a confluence of geography and the history of electric infrastructure in Vermont — which grew out of densely populated village centers — Lamoille County is served by ten different utilities.
Johnstone was also careful to emphasize that a possible consolidation was not his purpose for taking over administrative duties in the village in this troubled time.
“Our intention is to help neighbors and, if they want to, they can get back on their feet and find their way forward,” Johnstone said. “That’s entirely good for us. We’re doing this because we want to help other communities.”

Oct. 29. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined attorneys general and governors from 20 other states to sue the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development over a new policy that they say drastically alters the ability of state and local agencies, as well as non-profit groups, to combat homelessness.
The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in federal court in the District of Rhode Island. 
“The complaint alleges HUD violated its own regulations by not engaging in rulemaking before issuing the changes and violated the law by not receiving congressional authorization for these new conditions, many of which are directly contrary to congressionally passed statutes and HUD’s own regulations,” a statement released by Nessel’s office said. 
The policy would significantly cut the amount of money that, through the Continuum of Care program, can be used to go towards permanent housing solutions. Only 30% of a grant could be used for permanent housing, while for previous grants, that limit was nearly 90%.
The new funding notice also imposes ideological barriers, including preventing any funding from going to organizations that acknowledge the existence of transgender or nonbinary people. It also moves away from a “Housing First” model that did not require preconditions like stable income or sobriety for access to support from the program.
“The Continuum of Care grant program is the backbone of efforts to combat homelessness across Michigan and throughout the country,” Nessel said in a press release. “Restricting funding and imposing illegal conditions on these grants violates HUD’s mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities for all. If permitted to take effect, these changes will displace thousands of Michigan families.”
The changes have been widely criticized by housing advocates, who say that they will keep currently unhoused people without access to housing and will push some people who rely on support from Continuum of Care programs back into homelessness. 
Last year, Michigan received over $100 million from the Continuum of Care grant program. Nessel’s office, in a press release, estimated that the changes in this year’s updated Notice of Funding Opportunity would put 7,000 households, including around 2,000 families with children, at risk of losing their housing.
The Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness, a group of 92 homeless service providers, said that over the organization’s 35 years in existence, they had “never encountered a threat as devastating and extreme to persons in poverty” as detrimental as the new changes.. 
“Not only will this application fracture the homeless service delivery infrastructure, which has taken decades to build, but lives will be lost,” said Sarah Rennie, Senior Director of Advocacy for the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness. “This [Continuum of Care Notice of Funding Opportunity] completely misunderstands the root causes of homelessness. Homeless rates in Michigan continue to rise, not because of a failure in the current homeless service delivery system, but because Michigan faces an affordable housing crisis.”

The True Story of Thanksgiving by Rush Limbaugh

“The story of the Pilgrims begins in the early part of the seventeenth century… The Church of England under King James I was persecuting anyone and everyone who did not recognize [the church’s] absolute civil and spiritual authority,” actually, the state.
“Those who challenged ecclesiastical authority and those who believed strongly in freedom of worship were hunted down…” This is in England in the 1600s. They “were hunted down and imprisoned, and sometimes executed for their beliefs. A group of separatists,” people who didn’t want any part of this, “first fled to Holland,” they liked wooden shoes and cheese, “and established a community.”
They were there for eleven years. “After eleven years, about forty of” these separatists who liked wooden shoes and cheese, “agreed to make a perilous journey to the New World…” They had heard about it. Some new, exciting place that hadn’t been developed. They knew they would “face hardships,” hardships like you and I don’t know — and I’m not preaching to you.
I’m just telling you, we don’t know the hardship these people endured. We can’t. We are way too advanced now. People who lived in the 1600s would not believe life today. (Snort!) Try to explain flight, jet travel. They wouldn’t understand it. They knew they would “face hardships,” but paramount importance to them was living freely and worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences, their own beliefs.
That’s what they were denied the freedom to do in England. “On August 1, 1620, the Mayflower set sail. It carried a total of 102 passengers, including forty” of these separatists, the Pilgrims. There were just 40 of them. They were “led by William Bradford. On the journey” across the Atlantic… You talk about something that had to be frightening and scary?
Rush Limbaugh in the Excellence in Broadcasting Studio in 2020.  See the video and the full transcirpt at The True Story of Thanksgiving – Rush H. Limbaugh III
The Mayflower was not much bigger than a 50-foot boat, and 102 people on it. “On the journey, Bradford set up an agreement, a contract” if you will, “that established just and equal laws for all [40] members of the [Pilgrim] community, irrespective of their religious beliefs.” It didn’t matter what their religious beliefs were.
These are the laws they were all agreeing to live by. “Where did the revolutionary ideas,” these laws, come from? We’re talking about the Mayflower Compact. That is what Bradford wrote. The Mayflower Compact derived “[f]rom the Bible. The Pilgrims were a people completely steeped in the lessons of the Old and New Testaments.”
They were devoutly religious people. No matter what else is said about them (and even that is denied), they were devoutly religious. “They looked to the ancient Israelites for their example. And, because of the biblical precedents set forth in Scripture, they never doubted that their experiment would work.”
They never doubted they would get to the New World. They never doubted that once they got there, they would thrive. The journey was long; it was arduous; it was dangerous. And when they finally landed, when the Pilgrims finally landed in New England in November, according to William Bradford’s detailed journal, they found a cold, barren, desolate wilderness. Imagine New England as it exists today as nothing but rocks, forest, undeveloped nature in November and getting colder.
There were no friends to greet them. There was no shelter of any kind other than hiding under a tree, there was nothing, folks. It was desolate. There were no hotels. There were no inns. There were no places to clean up. There were no houses. I mean, this was real hardship. The sacrifice that they had made for the freedom to worship was just beginning.
During that first winter — remember, they arrive in November — during that first winter, half of them, including William Bradford’s own wife, died of starvation, of sickness, exposure to the elements. Now we’re getting close to what you were taught in school. When spring finally came — and, by the way, writing that doesn’t do it justice. Spring didn’t just finally come. It was a survival. It was an act of survival that you and I cannot possibly relate to or understand.
American Special Forces can. Military people who’ve been trained can understand what the Pilgrims were — you and I can’t. We’ve never done anything like that first winter in the New World. They survived it. Spring finally came. They did meet the Indians, the Native Americans who were there, who did help them in planting corn and fishing for cod. They showed ’em where the beavers were so the beavers could be skinned for coats, other things. You animal rights people are not gonna like some of this story, but it happened.
But even at this, even with this degree of assistance from the Indians, the Native Americans, there wasn’t any prosperity yet. They had the Mayflower Compact. They had these laws they were living by, and there was no prosperity. And I wonder why. Now, this is important to understand here, folks, because this is where modern American history lessons end, with the Indians teaching the Pilgrims how to eat, how to fish, how to skin beavers, and all that.
That’s where it ends. And that’s the feel-good story. But that doesn’t even get close to the true story. You know, Thanksgiving is actually explained in some textbooks as a holiday for which the Pilgrims gave thanks to the Indians for saving their lives. It wasn’t that. That happened, but Thanksgiving was a devout expression of gratitude, the Pilgrims, to God for their survival, and everything that was a part of it.
Now, here’s the part that has been omitted. The original contract the Pilgrims entered into in Holland — they had sponsors. They didn’t have the money to do this trip on their own. They had sponsors. There were merchant sponsors in London and in Holland. And these merchant sponsors demanded that everything that the Pilgrims produced in the New World would go into a common store, a single bank, if you will. And that each member of the Pilgrim community was entitled to one share.
So everybody had an equal share of whatever was in that bank. All of the land they cleared, all of the houses they built belonged to that bank, to the community as well. And they were going to distribute it equally, because they were gonna be fair. So all of the land that they cleared and all the houses they built belonged to everybody. Belonged to the community. Belonged to the bank, belonged to the common store. Nobody owned anything. They just had an equal share in it. It was a commune.
The Pilgrims established a commune, essentially. Forerunner of the communes we saw in the sixties and seventies out in California. They even had their own organic vegetables, by the way. Yep. The Pilgrims, forerunners of organic vegetables. Of course, what else could there be? No such thing as processed anything back then.
Now, William Bradford, who had become the governor of the colony ’cause he was the leader, recognized that this wasn’t gonna work. This was costly and destructive, and it just wasn’t working. It was collectivism. It was socialism. It wasn’t working. That first winner had taken a lot of lives. The manpower was greatly reduced. So William Bradford decided to take bold action, which I will describe when we get back.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: William Bradford, the governor of the Pilgrim community, saw that none of this was working. The Mayflower Compact was not working. Giving everybody a single share of stock in the common store, in the common bank was not working. Collectivism. It was as costly and destructive to the Pilgrims as it is and has been to anybody who has ever tried it.
So Bradford decided to scrub it. He threw it out and took bold action. He assigned a plot of land to each family. Every family was given a plot of land. They could work it, manage it however they wanted to. If they just wanted to sit on it, get fat, dumb, happy, and lazy, they could. If they wanted to develop it, if they wanted to grow corn, whatever on it, they could. If they wanted to build on it, they could do that. If they wanted to turn it into a quasi-business, they could do whatever they wanted to do with it.
He turned loose the power of the capitalist marketplace. Long before Karl Marx was even born. Long before Karl Marx was a sperm cell in his father’s dreams, the Pilgrims had discovered and experimented with what could only be described as socialism, and they found that it didn’t work. Now, it wasn’t called that then. But that’s exactly what it was. Everybody was given an equal share. You know what happened? Nobody did anything. There was no incentive. Nothing worked. Nothing happened.
“What Bradford and his community found was that the most creative and industrious people had no incentive to work any harder than anyone else, unless they could utilize the power of personal motivation! But while most of the rest of the world has been experimenting with socialism for well over a hundred years — trying to refine it, perfect it, and re-invent it — the Pilgrims decided early on to scrap it permanently. What Bradford wrote about this social experiment should be in every schoolchild’s history lesson. If it were, we might prevent much needless suffering,” if the true story of Thanksgiving had been taught for years and years and years.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: So, William Bradford, after putting everybody in a common store, the Mayflower Compact… They wanted to be fair. They wanted everybody to have one common share of stock in everything that happened that the Pilgrims produced — and it bombed. It didn’t work.
There was no prosperity; there was no creativity because there was no incentive. Here’s what Bradford wrote about the failure: “‘For this community [so far as it was] was found to breed much confusion and discontent…’” They were not happy, in other words. “‘[T]his community was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.’”
In other words, nobody worked.
The way they set it up, killed and discouraged work.
There was no need.
“‘For young men that were most able and fit for labor and service’” sat around and did nothing. “‘[T]hey should spend their time and strength to work for other men’s wives and children without’” being paid for it? Why should they do that? So, they didn’t. “‘[T]hat was thought injustice.’ Why should you work for other people when you can’t work for yourself? What’s the point? Do you hear what he was saying, ladies and gentlemen?
“The Pilgrims found that people could not be expected to do their best work without incentive. So, what did Bradford’s community try next? They unharnessed the power of good old free enterprise by invoking” capitalism, “the principle of private property,” all the way back in the 1600s. It was incredible. “Every family was assigned its own plot of land,” and they could do with it whatever they wanted to do.
“‘This had very good success,’ wrote Bradford, ‘for it made all hands industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been.’” So when profit was introduced, when the opportunity to prosper was introduced, it went gangbusters. That, my friends, is the essence of the True Story of Thanksgiving. “Now, this is where it gets really good, folks, if you’re laboring under the misconception that I was, as I was taught in school.
“So they set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians” after they had enjoyed this prosperity. It was not the Indians that brought them to prosperity. It’s not said to insult anybody. The Indians assisted in their arrival undeniably. But what led to prosperity for these original settlers was the common store failed. Socialism didn’t work.
It’s when they introduced what turns out to be capitalism. They didn’t have the name for it, but when they turned loose individual incentive — keep what you produce, sell what you don’t need — it went crazy. This is not something they were taught by anybody by self-experience. It was not the Indians. None of this is said to put anybody down. Don’t misunderstand.
The Indians did a lot of things that helped them, which I’ll get to in just a second, but it was their own industriousness. “[T]hey set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians.” They sold stuff to them, and those “profits allowed them to pay off their debts to the merchants,” their sponsors in London and in Holland, and you know what?
The success of that colony after they had abandoned socialism and tried what was essentially capitalism, the word spread throughout the Old World of this massive amount of prosperity that was there for the taking in the New World. And guess what happened? The New World was flooded with new arrivals. “[T]he success and prosperity of the Plymouth settlement attracted more Europeans and began what came to be known as the ‘Great Puritan Migration.’”
And all it took was prosperity and the word spreading across the Atlantic Ocean of how there was prosperity and it was there for the taking. All you had to do was get there and give it a shot. The lesson is — The True Story of Thanksgiving is — that William Bradford and his Pilgrim community were thanking God for the blessings on their community after the first miserable winter of a documented failure brought on by their attempt at fairness and equality, which was socialism.
It didn’t work.
Only when they abandoned it did it work — and I need to say it again, because I don’t want people to misunderstand and get noses out of joint. The Native Americans, the indigenous people, the Injuns, whatever you want to call ’em, they were of considerable assistance, and they were friendly when the Pilgrims arrived. But they had little, if anything, to do with the prosperity that occurred.
Because that was the result of Bradford and the Pilgrim leadership deciding to change their structure, the Mayflower Compact. Now, Indians assisted, naturally. I can’t deny it. I mean, they taught them how to fish and this kind of thing that they didn’t know how to do, and that led them to be productive, undeniably so. But it was the Pilgrim community itself which experienced this massive prosperity.
The word of which spread all the way back to the Old World, Europe across the Atlantic Ocean.
Now, I mentioned earlier that The Federalist has a story on all this, and in it they describe much of what we did in the second book that dealt with this, the children’s book, Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims. That book goes into great detail about how the Indians did provide assistance and what kind of assistance it was, how valuable it was and how crucial it was.
In Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims, we focus on a Native American by the name of Squanto. Now, as I told you, “During the winter of 1620, only 44 out of the original 102 [Pilgrims] survived, including their first elected governor of the colony, John Carver,” and it was “an Indian named Squanto came to their rescue.” As I say, this is, as I say, explored in great detail in Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims.
“Squanto was no ordinary native. Early settlers in 1610 had captured him and sold him into slavery. A group of Catholic friars freed him and brought him to England, where he learned to speak English. In 1618, serving as an interpreter on an English ship, he was brought back to the New World.” It was Squanto — who is a famous Native American in his own right in the Pilgrim story. it was Squanto who “taught the Pilgrims how to plant and fish,” how to skin beavers. It was Squanto who “broker[ed] a peace treaty between the Pilgrims and other Indian tribes.”
There was more than one tribe of Indians. It was not copacetic. It was not friendly and at one with nature. It was not anything like the multiculturalists would have you believe. There were squabbles; there were power struggles; turf battles. It was human. The Indians, the Pilgrims, everybody was scrambling for power, for survival. Survivability was the name of the game. And it was not guaranteed.
Now, many of the Pilgrims literally believed that God had sent Squanto to save them. And they believed, the Pilgrims believed, that without Squanto they never would have survived, or thrived. And they experienced a tremendous harvest in 1621, and that’s the big gathering that is taught in the history books, the native Indians and the Pilgrims joined together for a huge feast, which is the foundational story of the Thanksgiving story that’s taught in public schools.
But, again, that is not The Real Story of Thanksgiving. That’s the textbook brand. It did happen, but it’s so much more than that. And I love taking the opportunity every year to explain the truth of, especially now given this election’s apparently, allegedly fallen out. Because even at The Federalist — this is so great that the story is spreading. “One of the most important legacies of early settlers is that they experimented with socialism in the 1620s, and it didn’t work. Private property rights and personal responsibility, two pillars of a free market economy, saved the Plymouth colony from extinction and laid the economic foundation for a free and prosperous nation that we all enjoy today.”
And that is exactly right. And that is The True Story of Thanksgiving. And that has been what should have been shared with you every Thanksgiving for the past 31 years.

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”

Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.

The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski denounced the Trump administration’s targeting of Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly on Tuesday, saying on social media that its actions are “reckless and flat-out wrong.”
Kelly, a retired astronaut and U.S. Navy officer, was one of six Democratic senators who appeared in a video directed to members of the U.S. military. In that video, they say members of the military are being subject to political pressure and should uphold the Constitution and ignore “illegal orders.”
Afterward, President Donald Trump took to social media to call for all six to be executed for treason. The FBI has begun to make inquiries about the video, and the Department of Defense have vowed to investigate. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been particularly critical of Kelly.
“Senator Kelly valiantly served our country as an aviator in the U.S. Navy before later completing four space shuttle missions as a NASA astronaut,” Murkowski said. “To accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong. The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.”
It has become unusual for elected Republican officials to speak in defense of elected Democrats, particularly when it places them at odds with President Donald Trump, who remains popular among Republican voters, even if his approval overall is low.
Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan previously expressed concerns about the possible politicization of the military during the presidency of Democrat Joe Biden. 
Asked about the situation with Kelly, Sullivan criticized the Democratic video and the administration’s response to it. 
“The Democrats in the video have offered no explanation of what they considered to be an illegal order, sowing confusion and politicizing the ranks in a way that risks undermining military discipline, lethality and readiness,” his office said in a written statement.
The statement went on to say that “he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly” because “such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military.”
The office of Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, did not return a text message or email seeking comment.
Sullivan’s office requested that his statement be printed in full. Because it has not been published elsewhere, we think there is news value in reprinting it, so it is published below.
“Senator Sullivan strongly disagreed with many actions taken by the Pentagon under Presidents Obama and Biden — such as President Biden’s use of enlisted Marines as political props standing behind him in a very partisan speech in Philadelphia in 2022. But he would never have put out a video — like the one released by Senator Mark Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers — implying that troops should question orders from their superiors. The Democrats in the video have offered no explanation of what they considered to be an illegal order, sowing confusion and politicizing the ranks in a way that risks undermining military discipline, lethality and readiness. 
Instead of using our troops as political pawns, members of Congress should press top Pentagon officials directly on issues over which they have concerns. Senator Sullivan does this regularly in Senate Armed Services Committee hearings and in meetings and phone calls with top Pentagon leaders regardless of which party controls the White House.
While Senator Sullivan believes the message in the video was irresponsible and politically driven, he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly — who served honorably in the Navy — under the UCMJ, particularly given that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause would likely take precedence over any UCMJ provision. Such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military. After four years of Biden’s woke military, the Department of War needs to stay laser focused on lethality and war fighting.”

(Courtesy Tami Smith)Like she does every Tuesday afternoon when the bell rings at the Shepherd’s Closet in Elephant Butte, Tami Smith stepped out the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to greet a growing line of hungry people at the food pantry she runs. Then, like she also does every Tuesday, she joined some of them in prayer.
This week, ahead of Thanksgiving, she said she read from Isaiah 41:10. It was a reminder, she said, that, “There will always be trials and tribulations in life, but God will carry you through every storm.” Then she helped 138 households comprising 523 people get food for the week, she said.

The county’s high rate of SNAP reliance made the food pantry even more vital earlier this year when federal cuts and stoppages threw the program into upheaval, Smith said. The food pantry distributes at least 36,000 pounds of food a month, she said, to people who line up beginning at 7:30 a.m. and come from as far away as Alamogordo, Socorro or Las Cruces. 
“When you have food insecurity, and then you have all this going on with SNAP, people panic,” she said. “They want to make sure that they have enough food for their family. And we have multi-generational families here. It’s not uncommon to have 11, 12, 15 people in the household.”
Those people have turned to Shepherd’s Closet during a chaotic year. 
First, federal cuts to The Emergency Food Assistance Program left Roadrunner Food Bank, which supplies most of the pantry’s food, with 30 fewer truckloads, primarily of dairy products. The food pantry in Elephant Butte had to make up the difference with canned food, Smith said. 
Then, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed in July contained provisions that cut SNAP and imposed future work requirements, along with other measures that prompted longer lines at the food pantry. 
Finally, when the federal government shut down Oct. 1, Smith said she knew to expect even longer lines. She’s worked as a volunteer at the pantry for a decade, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“It was severe fear and panic during the pandemic, and we see that same stuff right now, because it’s still so uncertain,” she said. “And people, especially during the holidays, they panic because they don’t think they can get enough food.”

The food line has not shrunk even though the state stepped in to pay for SNAP itself, first with a $30 million payment that covered SNAP through the first days of November and later with a $162.5 million payment meant to cover the program through January. And the line has stayed long even after the 43-day federal government shutdown ended, Smith said. 
“As long as there’s still that fear out there, the lines are not going to go down,” she said. “It would take the government to agree all the time, which won’t ever happen.”
Amid the panic, Smith said Shepherd’s Closet will continue opening every Tuesday to give out as much food as people need without judgment.
“I don’t ask many questions, because that’s not my business,” she said. “God says, ‘Feed my people.’ That’s what I do.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3203-e1764175859222-1024x826.jpg,,,2025-11-27 08:57:25.223379

He rolls out of bed, lets his dog out and drinks his first cup of coffee. After making sure his kids’ water bottles are full, Reid walks to nearby Lewisburg Elementary School. In the crisp air and dark morning, he starts a school bus, waiting for it to warm up.
Reid, a physical education teacher in DeSoto County School District, has been teaching for 17 years. But in 2019, he also started moonlighting as a bus driver to earn extra money.
This is a reality for educators in Mississippi, which has the nation’s lowest teacher pay. 
According to the National Education Association, the average teacher salary in Mississippi is $53,704. That’s $15,000 less than what the Economic Policy Institute says is needed to comfortably support a single parent, one child household in the Jackson metro area, which is $68,772. In DeSoto County, where Reid lives, that cost is even higher — $76,612 a year.
Even though some districts pay teachers more than the state minimum, without a spouse making higher pay, some educators say they have to keep second jobs and cut corners to make ends meet. 
Some promising young teachers — and even others with years of experience — are considering moving to other states where they are better compensated. 
Mississippi is up against a critical teacher shortage. Nearly 3,000 teacher jobs are vacant across the state, according to a 2024 survey conducted by the Mississippi Department of Education. Educators say the biggest contributing factor to those vacancies is low pay, according to the Mississippi Professional Educators’ annual survey.

Teacher vacancies mean bigger classrooms and less individualized time, which deeply impact student learning. Research shows that higher pay attracts quality teachers and incentivizes them to stay. 
On the heels of nationally recognized academic achievement in the state’s public schools, teachers say they deserve more. 
And legislators say they’re listening. The issue will likely be a hot topic during the 2026 legislative session. State leaders, such as Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, have indicated they’ll focus on raising teacher pay next year, and the Senate Education Committee met about the topic in October. House Speaker Jason White said this summer that his chamber will likely include all of its education policy, including school choice measures, in an omnibus bill next session.
Educators fear their salaries will get tied up in the controversial legislation.
“Teachers should not be held hostage and used as political pawns in order to gain support for another policy issue,” said Kelly Riley, executive director of Mississippi Professional Educators. “It appears to be another sign of disrespect for our educators and teaching profession as a whole.”
Legislators passed the last meaningful teacher pay raise in 2022, a historic increase of $5,140 on average per year. But teachers say that raise was almost immediately rendered null by health insurance premium increases and inflation.
And the retirement benefits that previously kept educators in the profession were changed earlier this year, when state legislators overhauled the public employee retirement system. Teachers who start after March 1, 2026, will receive fewer benefits than their peers. 
It’s a bleak outlook that young educators, such as second-year teacher Vivienne Diaz in Jackson, have to reckon with.
“I would like to stay in Mississippi, but after I finish my master’s degree, the amount of money I’d be making as a teacher …  after all these hours of work,” she said, “it’s just not worth it.”
‘A double kick to public school teachers’
Princess Thompson can smile about it now, but she remembers feeling shocked when she received her first paycheck 20 years ago. Her annual $24,000 salary translated to $1,300 a month.
“I asked my principal, ‘Is everything OK?’” said Thompson, who teaches music at an elementary school in Madison. “Me and another first-year teacher were like, ‘What happened here?’ Our principal laughed.”

Now, two decades into her career, her pay is better. But teaching has also gotten harder. Kids are entering kindergarten with learning difficulties that should have been addressed in preschool. She said that this generation of children, raised around screens, is difficult to keep engaged.
On the Gulf Coast, Carrie Bartlett’s older students are also easily distracted, and she reports more behavior issues in recent years. Without commensurate pay, it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with, she said.
Bartlett has been teaching social studies at Long Beach High School for 15 years, and her husband teaches at Long Beach Middle School. With a daughter in her sophomore year of high school and a son in college, their finances are tight.
When Bartlett and her colleagues commiserate, they echo the same sentiments about the job — they love being educators, but they wish they were getting compensated as professionals.
“I think that teaching is an important job, and it’s rewarding intrinsically,” Bartlett said. “I just wish it was more extrinsically rewarding and that the state had higher appreciation for us doing this job, educating the state’s future.” 
Despite talks about raising teacher pay next year, Bartlett doesn’t feel appreciated. Adding insult to injury are state leaders’ discussions about expanding school choice, or policies to fund education outside of public schools, she said. 
“Pay raises should continue regularly and not be attached to political footballs, which is what I fear will happen this year,” she said. “It’s a double kick to public school teachers.”
Rising health insurance costs
The worst part about being a teacher? According to Reid — and educators across the state surveyed by the teachers association — it’s the health insurance premiums. 
When the state raised teacher pay in 2022, the monthly cost for teachers to insure themselves and their families was around $700. 
Four years later, that’s up to about $900 a month, or $10,800 a year. It’s an annual increase of $2,400. For a teacher with 10 years of experience and a master’s degree, that’s more than a fifth of their salary. At the same time, deductibles have gone up.
Rising premiums are a major part of what’s driving teachers away from the sector, said Megan Boren, who leads teacher workforce policy efforts for the Southern Regional Education Board, a nonprofit focused on improving education. In October, Boren spoke to Mississippi senators about challenges facing the education system nationwide and in the South. During that presentation, she said health insurance premiums have gone down in the region, largely due to reductions in two Southern states with some of the highest premiums. 
In Mississippi and most of the region, costs keep going up.
“Typically, older and more experienced teachers are the ones who have a family to cover,” she told Mississippi Today. “When you factor in premiums for a family, those teachers’ net pay has decreased because of that significantly increased cost.”
Reid has had cancer twice. During his second round of treatment in 2022, his deductible was $13,000. He met the deductible early on, but still spent a huge chunk of money, he said. And as a teacher, there’s not an option to take paid medical leave.
“We go on vacation … we’re not living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “But we can’t live the lifestyle a lot of neighbors would live.”
Reid’s wife also drives a school bus to supplement their income. Their kids are limited to one sport each. The family used just one car to get around for a long time. And for a year, they made do with a mostly broken washer.

It’s not what a 17-year classroom veteran deserves, he said. 
After a quarter century in the classroom, Julie Price, a third grade reading and social studies teacher in Pearl, is getting paid less than her son in his first year as a civil engineer at the Mississippi Department of Transportation. 
“I’m proud of him, and I know the job is challenging and complicated,” she said. “But that was a slap in the face.” 
Though Price is too invested in her life in Mississippi to leave, temptation lingers. In her home state of Alabama, just a few hours away, she’d be paid almost $10,000 more each year, she said.  
Price’s husband died from COVID-19 complications in January 2021. Abruptly going from two salaries to one, right as her son was headed to college, was hard — and still is, she said. 
Recently, Price had to renew her car tag, a $300 expense that she didn’t budget for. She and her son only eat out once a week. And without meeting her deductible, going to the doctor for continuing neck issues has been expensive. 
“If you don’t have some cushion in there, you’d wipe your money out,” Price said. “Then how would you live?”
To attract quality people to the profession in Mississippi, Reid said, pay raises need to be frequent and substantial.
“Politicians can’t raise pay once and take three to four years off in between election cycles because these pay raises degrade so quickly,” he said. 
“If we want our schools to be great, we’ve got to pay for that.”
Can Mississippi teachers afford to stay?

What she sees ahead makes her nervous.

Diaz, the daughter of a teacher, didn’t go in blind. She knew her pay wouldn’t reflect the hours she’d spend outside of the classroom, planning her lessons and sponsoring a club. With her free time, Diaz helps plan educational programming and teaches at her synagogue on Sundays, which brings in around $200 a month. 
“My senior year, I told my mom, ‘I’ll never be a teacher. I see how you get treated,’” she said. “It is just as difficult as I knew it was going to be.”
But she loves mentoring her students, getting to watch them bloom and being part of the process. That’s why she became a teacher, despite the challenges. 
Still, when Diaz finishes her master’s degree in teaching, it doesn’t financially make sense for her to stay, no matter how much she loves teaching. She’s looking into schools in other states or a job in Mississippi in another field.
Diaz is exactly the kind of person Mississippi leaders want to keep around — a young, smart professional who might make her home and raise her family here. A pay raise is the bare minimum state leaders could do to keep people like Diaz in Mississippi, said Boren of SREB. 
“It’s really important for state leaders to recognize that the work here to help kind of restore faith in the profession, restore those wanting to come in and stay in the profession, it’s a comprehensive approach,” Boren said. “There’s not one silver bullet. Increasing pay alone is not going to cover it. 
“That’s not always what our leaders want to hear. They want to hear what’s the solution and how to fix it now, and I sympathize with that, but the solution is a comprehensive plan and a comprehensive investment in our educators and in the profession as a whole.”
Diaz might reconsider if lawmakers pass a substantial raise, she said. But even then, she’d think twice.
“I love watching my students learn and develop and become new people,” Diaz said. “But just because I have that heart doesn’t mean I don’t deserve that good paycheck.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10104333/3X0A2628.jpg,,,2025-11-27 12:58:49.861627

And the retirement benefits that previously kept educators in the profession were changed earlier this year, when state legislators overhauled the public employee retirement system. Teachers who start after March 1, 2026, will receive fewer benefits than their peers. 
It’s a bleak outlook that young educators, such as second-year teacher Vivienne Diaz in Jackson, have to reckon with.
“I would like to stay in Mississippi, but after I finish my master’s degree, the amount of money I’d be making as a teacher …  after all these hours of work,” she said, “it’s just not worth it.”
‘A double kick to public school teachers’
Princess Thompson can smile about it now, but she remembers feeling shocked when she received her first paycheck 20 years ago. Her annual $24,000 salary translated to $1,300 a month.
“I asked my principal, ‘Is everything OK?’” said Thompson, who teaches music at an elementary school in Madison. “Me and another first-year teacher were like, ‘What happened here?’ Our principal laughed.”

Now, two decades into her career, her pay is better. But teaching has also gotten harder. Kids are entering kindergarten with learning difficulties that should have been addressed in preschool. She said that this generation of children, raised around screens, is difficult to keep engaged.
On the Gulf Coast, Carrie Bartlett’s older students are also easily distracted, and she reports more behavior issues in recent years. Without commensurate pay, it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with, she said.
Bartlett has been teaching social studies at Long Beach High School for 15 years, and her husband teaches at Long Beach Middle School. With a daughter in her sophomore year of high school and a son in college, their finances are tight.
When Bartlett and her colleagues commiserate, they echo the same sentiments about the job — they love being educators, but they wish they were getting compensated as professionals.
“I think that teaching is an important job, and it’s rewarding intrinsically,” Bartlett said. “I just wish it was more extrinsically rewarding and that the state had higher appreciation for us doing this job, educating the state’s future.” 
Despite talks about raising teacher pay next year, Bartlett doesn’t feel appreciated. Adding insult to injury are state leaders’ discussions about expanding school choice, or policies to fund education outside of public schools, she said. 
“Pay raises should continue regularly and not be attached to political footballs, which is what I fear will happen this year,” she said. “It’s a double kick to public school teachers.”
Rising health insurance costs
The worst part about being a teacher? According to Reid — and educators across the state surveyed by the teachers association — it’s the health insurance premiums. 
When the state raised teacher pay in 2022, the monthly cost for teachers to insure themselves and their families was around $700. 
Four years later, that’s up to about $900 a month, or $10,800 a year. It’s an annual increase of $2,400. For a teacher with 10 years of experience and a master’s degree, that’s more than a fifth of their salary. At the same time, deductibles have gone up.
Rising premiums are a major part of what’s driving teachers away from the sector, said Megan Boren, who leads teacher workforce policy efforts for the Southern Regional Education Board, a nonprofit focused on improving education. In October, Boren spoke to Mississippi senators about challenges facing the education system nationwide and in the South. During that presentation, she said health insurance premiums have gone down in the region, largely due to reductions in two Southern states with some of the highest premiums. 
In Mississippi and most of the region, costs keep going up.
“Typically, older and more experienced teachers are the ones who have a family to cover,” she told Mississippi Today. “When you factor in premiums for a family, those teachers’ net pay has decreased because of that significantly increased cost.”
Reid has had cancer twice. During his second round of treatment in 2022, his deductible was $13,000. He met the deductible early on, but still spent a huge chunk of money, he said. And as a teacher, there’s not an option to take paid medical leave.
“We go on vacation … we’re not living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “But we can’t live the lifestyle a lot of neighbors would live.”
Reid’s wife also drives a school bus to supplement their income. Their kids are limited to one sport each. The family used just one car to get around for a long time. And for a year, they made do with a mostly broken washer.

It’s not what a 17-year classroom veteran deserves, he said. 
After a quarter century in the classroom, Julie Price, a third grade reading and social studies teacher in Pearl, is getting paid less than her son in his first year as a civil engineer at the Mississippi Department of Transportation. 
“I’m proud of him, and I know the job is challenging and complicated,” she said. “But that was a slap in the face.” 
Though Price is too invested in her life in Mississippi to leave, temptation lingers. In her home state of Alabama, just a few hours away, she’d be paid almost $10,000 more each year, she said.  
Price’s husband died from COVID-19 complications in January 2021. Abruptly going from two salaries to one, right as her son was headed to college, was hard — and still is, she said. 
Recently, Price had to renew her car tag, a $300 expense that she didn’t budget for. She and her son only eat out once a week. And without meeting her deductible, going to the doctor for continuing neck issues has been expensive. 
“If you don’t have some cushion in there, you’d wipe your money out,” Price said. “Then how would you live?”
To attract quality people to the profession in Mississippi, Reid said, pay raises need to be frequent and substantial.
“Politicians can’t raise pay once and take three to four years off in between election cycles because these pay raises degrade so quickly,” he said. 
“If we want our schools to be great, we’ve got to pay for that.”
Can Mississippi teachers afford to stay?

What she sees ahead makes her nervous.

Diaz, the daughter of a teacher, didn’t go in blind. She knew her pay wouldn’t reflect the hours she’d spend outside of the classroom, planning her lessons and sponsoring a club. With her free time, Diaz helps plan educational programming and teaches at her synagogue on Sundays, which brings in around $200 a month. 
“My senior year, I told my mom, ‘I’ll never be a teacher. I see how you get treated,’” she said. “It is just as difficult as I knew it was going to be.”
But she loves mentoring her students, getting to watch them bloom and being part of the process. That’s why she became a teacher, despite the challenges. 
Still, when Diaz finishes her master’s degree in teaching, it doesn’t financially make sense for her to stay, no matter how much she loves teaching. She’s looking into schools in other states or a job in Mississippi in another field.
Diaz is exactly the kind of person Mississippi leaders want to keep around — a young, smart professional who might make her home and raise her family here. A pay raise is the bare minimum state leaders could do to keep people like Diaz in Mississippi, said Boren of SREB. 
“It’s really important for state leaders to recognize that the work here to help kind of restore faith in the profession, restore those wanting to come in and stay in the profession, it’s a comprehensive approach,” Boren said. “There’s not one silver bullet. Increasing pay alone is not going to cover it. 
“That’s not always what our leaders want to hear. They want to hear what’s the solution and how to fix it now, and I sympathize with that, but the solution is a comprehensive plan and a comprehensive investment in our educators and in the profession as a whole.”
Diaz might reconsider if lawmakers pass a substantial raise, she said. But even then, she’d think twice.
“I love watching my students learn and develop and become new people,” Diaz said. “But just because I have that heart doesn’t mean I don’t deserve that good paycheck.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10104333/3X0A2628.jpg,,,2025-11-27 08:57:25.223379

SB 24, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles to inform those who have lost their right to vote how to register to vote. Messages seeking comment from Coleman-Madison were left Tuesday. 
Under current law, certain people who have lost the right to vote due to a conviction can re-register once they serve their sentence and pay any fines related to the conviction. Current law does not require the Board of Pardons and Paroles to educate those people on how to get their voting status restored.

Jerome Dees, Alabama policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), said in an interview Monday that SPLC is supportive of any legislation that makes participation in democracy easier.
“The concept that restoring voting rights overall, whether that’s administrative or legislation that directly gets at restoring the right and changing eligibility, ultimately strengthens families and communities,” Dees said. 
Coleman-Madison sponsored a similar bill in the 2025 session. It was approved by the Senate, and the House Judiciary Committee, but was not considered by the full House. The 2026 bill mirrors the latest version of the 2025 bill.
According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), treason and impeachment are the only crimes not eligible for restoration of voting rights. 
“There’s an extensive list that was actually recently added to … you temporarily lose the ability to vote, but then you have the ability, after certain criteria are met, to have that right restored,” Dees said.
According to the Alabama Department of Corrections, 21,034 people are in Alabama’s prisons. The state is building a new prison in Elmore County, which is scheduled to open in October, to help reduce overcrowding.
The bill also requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles to notify the Secretary of State’s Office of who has completed the necessary steps to restore their voting rights. A message seeking comment from the Secretary of State’s Office was left Monday afternoon. 
“I certainly hope that the Secretary of State will see the benefit of efficiency in the process and making sure that individuals who do have the right to vote, and whether that’s they never lost it or it has been restored that they are given every opportunity to be able to participate in the voting process, particularly if that means the government removing hurdles and obstructions for those individuals,” Dees said. 
Dees said that most convicted of a felony never lose their right to vote, but the lack of education on registering to vote.
“There are a number of individuals who have been convicted of that first category that never lost their right to vote, but because of the lack of general public education and awareness, believed that they had lost their right to vote and just had never voted since,” Dees said.

Levitt,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/27/hudson-river-rail-tunnels/,"As Amtrak awaits the completion of the Gateway project, its crews spend every day inspecting the old tunnels it will replace.","Workers inside one of the Hudson River rail tunnels. (Courtesy of Amtrak)Every night, about 20 to 30 workers head inside the rail tunnels under the Hudson River to make sure New Jersey commuters can make it safely in and out of Manhattan.
They eyeball the decaying 115-year-old tunnels, which for more than a decade have been slated to be augmented by new tunnel projects, and make sure they are clear and passable.
Officials in both states want the old tunnels, which opened during the Taft administration, supplemented with newer tubes. While the $16 billion project to build those tunnels, sometimes called the most important infrastructure project in the nation, is a cause celebre, not much is ever said about the current tunnels and the daily cause of making sure the 450 or so trains daily servicing more than 200,000 riders can pass through them.
The failure of even one of the two tubes would be a catastrophe for the entire northeast, but especially New York and northern New Jersey.

“We are not at a critical failure point yet. We could be if we don’t keep up with our maintenance and demands, but we are not yet at that point,”  said David Albright, Amtrak’s assistant division engineer for fire and life safety.
He added: “Because we spend time in there, and we do a lot of preventative maintenance, we are in a good state of repair.”
Albright leads the team of workers who inspect the tunnels, two tubes that connect New Jersey to New York Penn Station, the nation’s busiest train transit hub, as well as the four tubes under the East River that also service NJ Transit by providing it with a connection to the Sunnyside Yards in Queens, where trains bound for the Garden State are staged. The tunnels form a critical link that ties together not only Amtrak’s northeast corridor, but also NJ Transit and the Long Island Rail Road’s commuter service. 
Amtrak calls them the North River tunnels, a vestige of the days that ended in the 17th century when the region was controlled by the Dutch. They called the Hudson the North River, and the Delaware was called the South River.
Both tunnels are decrepit and in danger of not being passable. Albright’s team maintains and potentially upgrades the performance of these tunnels while waiting out the almost-decade it will take for them to be augmented with the two new tubes, called the Gateway project. 
“When you have 115-year-old infrastructure, you are going to see failure points,” Albright said.
His job often entails going into the tunnels and looking for cracks and fissures, or evidence of decay. In addition to his regular title, Albright is co-chair of the New York Penn Station and tunnel system emergency response task force. 
It didn’t help matters that, when the region was hit in October 2012 by Hurricane Sandy, the tunnels were inundated with up to six feet of salt water. Though the water is long gone, its corrosive power is still felt 13 years later and likely to continue for years more, causing disintegration of the largely concrete tubes. 
“Overall Amtrak’s goal is to not change any train service,” he said  “They want to maintain the same level of service, the same on-time service that we currently provide. And still update our infrastructure.” 
The digging of the new tunnels is an infrastructure project that never quite fades from the news. An earlier version was shut down by then-Gov. Chris Christie in 2010, who cited potential cost overruns. And during the recent federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump said he had terminated “the project in New York,” largely believed to be a reference to Gateway and/or the 2nd Avenue subway project.
Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Gateway Development Commission, a bi-state agency that represents the interests of the two states in expediting the project, said Gateway remains on track to be completed in 2035. 
Evidence of the project may be seen on Tonnelle Avenue, where a roadway bridge in North Bergen is being built that will carry Routes 1&9 over the tracks leading to the new tunnel. To the east, work is underway on the Palisades Tunnel, preparing the site for building the first mile of new tunnel with state-of-the-art boring machines. Such a machine is scheduled to arrive there in early 2026.
Overhead bridge and utility relocations have commenced at Tonnelle, and in New York, the construction of concrete casing in the Hudson Yards train yard has begun, according to Amtrak. 
Sigmund said the project is “on scope, schedule, and budget.”
Albright said he and his team are responsible for all the maintenance in the existing tunnels except for maintaining the tracks and the electronic traction system, which you may know from outside the tunnels as the catenary wires that feed power to the trains. Those are handled by a different engineering team at Amtrak. Amtrak is responsible for maintenance along the northeast corridor route for both NJ Transit and its own trains.
Albright’s team is responsible for maintaining the “benchwalls,” which are the concrete walls of each tube. The tunnel walls are about two feet thick, and they are constructed of reinforced concrete and steel.
These tunnels are the only way for Amtrak and NJ Transit trains to get in and out of Manhattan, noted  Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams. That makes it different from elsewhere in the coast-to-coast Amtrak system. In other places, trains can be rerouted around a problem spot. 
The walls carry all the electronic components that control the signaling, Albright said. The catenary system was severely damaged by the Sandy infiltration and is in need of an overhaul. 
Abrams said the railroad has installed flood doors outside the tubes to ward off any further inundation caused by a new storm.
Permanent repairs for the existing tunnels must wait until the middle of the next decade, when the first of the new tunnels is placed into service. At that time, one of the existing tubes will be taken out of service for the year and a half it will take to fully renovate it. Then it’s the other tube’s turn.
Other entities, notably New York’s police and fire departments and North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue, also have teams that examine the tunnels, Albright said.  
Albright and his team are also responsible for keeping passable the emergency evacuation system that hopefully no one ever has to use.
“We have egress door, ventilation shafts, there are also some passages that go between the two tunnels” that at its deepest is about 90 feet from the surface of the river, he said. “That could be detrimental to some of our riding public, to have to go up those stairs in emergencies.” 
He said Amtrak’s goal is first to send in a rescue engine to push or pull a stalled train out.
The White House has not clarified Trump’s remarks from October on the Gateway project’s potential termination. And Gateway itself is not commenting on that threat.
“We have, and continue to, decline comment on the President’s remarks from October,” Sigmund said.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Nov. 26, 2025.
The South Burlington school board and South Burlington Educators’ Association have ratified new tentative agreements for both a three-year teachers’ contract and a two-year support staff contract.
The contracts, while not yet publicly available by press deadline, will retroactively cover July 1 of this year through June 30, 2028, for teachers and through June 30, 2027, for support staff.
Teachers will receive a 4.25% raise for the first two years of the contract, with the third year increase set at whatever the inflation number is at the time, anywhere between 2-5%. Support staff will receive a 5.25% raise for the first year, and the same inflation-fixed increase for the second year.

“I think the overall story is that the board went into the negotiation very committed to holding costs down and making sustainable budgeting possible — the 4.25% and inflation being the three years of the term were the lowest cost that we could get,” School Board Chair Seamus Abshere said. “And in the last year, we were signaling an interest in returning to essentially cost-of-living adjustment based on inflation.”
Joe McNeil, the board’s attorney, noted that while the contract essentially maintains the same terms and conditions as previously in effect, most of the negotiations centered around money. And compared to past years, an agreement was come to relatively quickly.
“This really, for South Burlington, was fairly expeditious in the sense that several of the last agreements included declarations of impasse and then required mediation and fact finding,” McNeil said. “And in two instances, there were strikes.”
Noah Everitt, co-president of the South Burlington Educators’ Association, agreed that previous negotiations have often been characterized as contentious, but discussions this time didn’t fit that mold. Aside from the wage increase conversations, there weren’t any significant issues being negotiated this year, largely, Everitt said, thanks to the maturity of past contracts which had ironed out a lot of issues.
“I think any negotiation is ideally a place where both parties feel good about the resulting deal,” Everitt said. “And I think that that’s true of this one.”
He said that this time around, there were improvements made to language in the contract regarding the reduction in the force of probationary employees being placed on a “recall list.”
“That had been a challenge for folks in the past, because if you’re on probation in those first two years and different budgeting years can sometimes have some anticipated reductions that don’t end up happening because the budget passes,” Everitt said. “This would allow those folks to keep their jobs without having to reapply or start probation over.
While he didn’t consider this any sort of big win, it is ultimately better for everyone, he said.
Everitt led negotiations on the union side with a small team of teachers, while Abshere and new school board member Dan Boyer represented the board. Prior to Abshere, former board member Tim Warren had represented the board until he resigned in July amid district-wide tumult.
Beginning this spring, as the union demanded more vision and leadership around a passed budget that resulted in the reduction of nearly 15 full time equivalent positions, tensions were at an all-time high between teachers, district leadership and board members. The union ultimately engaged in multiple months of public activism and demanded that former superintendent Violet Nichols be removed from her role.
McNeil noted that anytime there is turmoil, there is concern about trust and the ability to speak candidly during negotiations for fear of creating additional fervor. But in this case, he said, when it came to negotiations, there was interest on both sides to begin the school year on a new page without letting those distractions get in the way.
Although some expressed concern that the public activism was a way for the union to get a leg up in negotiations, Everitt said that what was being discussed at the negotiating table had nothing to do with their asks from the district at that time.
“Those things were not the same,” he said. “We’ve really focused on trying to just maintain a consistent set of values that puts teachers and students first. And we think that by being consistent, a relationship can be developed between what can for teachers seem like a revolving door of board members, because they will be able to predict our behavior.”

It is important for all of America to recognize the degree to which the nation’s rogue leadership has pitted one America against the other and is tearing the nation apart.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: Two Americas.","This commentary is by David Moats, of Salisbury. He is editorial page editor emeritus at the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.
Two Americas were in evidence in Middlebury one Saturday in October


One America was present at Middlebury College for a football game against the team from Bates College. This is the America where higher education is a common rite of passage, where international travel is a frequent avenue of adventure and cultural enrichment, where travel on the nation’s highways occasions a feeling of liberation, where home ownership is taken for granted. It is where people stand for the national anthem and the commonly felt message is: This is America.
But there is another America, also present in Middlebury that Saturday. At the Champlain Valley Unitarian-Universalist Church, a steady stream of people arrived during the day to meet with officials from the Mexican consulate in Boston. They were migrants seeking Mexican passports, mostly young men, but also women and children. The sanctuary was full, and the mood was relaxed and friendly, but the families there were all too aware of the danger around them — the arbitrary detention and deportation that could come crashing down on them at any time. 
The visit by Mexican consular officials is an annual event meant to serve residents from Mexico. But the Latino population in Vermont consists of more than the Mexican farm workers who for years have kept Vermont’s dairy economy afloat. Ecuadorean, Guatemalan, Venezuelan, Peruvian, Honduran, Brazilian, and other immigrants work in roofing, construction and other industries, many or most of them lacking the documentation that could protect them from the ongoing immigration crackdown.
It is easy for the one America not to notice the other. But among those who have noticed are the volunteers who work to provide health care, food, transportation, education, legal representation and other support for migrants, many of whom live in isolation out on the farm.
For the consular visit, the Open Door Clinic of Middlebury had put up tables along one side of the sanctuary to provide vaccinations and health care information. The advocacy group Migrant Justice had set up its own table. The language of the day was Spanish, and numerous volunteers with Spanish language skills were pitching in to help
One of those helping was Fernanda Canales, who came to the United States with her Chilean family when she was 14 years old and who recently retired after a 39-year career in education. For the last 16 years she was principal of the Salisbury Community School in Addison County.
And yet as deeply embedded in the community as she was, she said it was only after she retired and began work helping the region’s migrant population that she came to recognize and appreciate the broad and diverse Latino community that existed in Vermont. Even for her, an immigrant herself, the migrant community had largely been out of view.
Now Canales works as dental coordinator for the Open Door Clinic and as the multilingual liaison for the Addison Central School District. When she arrived in the United States, she knew no English. “I understand the journey,” she said, and she is glad for the chance to help with the journey of the thousands of Latinos trying to set down roots in Vermont.
It is not an easy journey, and it is getting harder. Vermont is not Chicago or Los Angeles, but Migrant Justice has compiled a list of 87 people detained this year by Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement as of a month ago. Since then more have been detained, including a group of 17 recently imprisoned at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Franklin County. Detainees are often people grabbed up on their way to work. They are people without recourse, which is why Migrant Justice and the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project work to keep track of who they are and what becomes of them.
Stories continue to emerge from across the nation of violent tactics by masked agents who act with impunity, ignoring due process and seizing people at will from the streets or on the job. For comfortable America, free to come and go, to take in the football game, or enjoy a vacation in Cancun, it is becoming an act of willful blindness to ignore or excuse the barbaric conditions at hastily constructed detention camps and the lawless manner in which people are seized and taken away from their families.  
It is important for the one America to see the other — see the people, driven by their own enterprising spirit to seek opportunity north of the border and to find jobs that will help them support their families here and back home, jobs upon which the U.S. economy depends.
It is important for all of America to recognize the degree to which the nation’s rogue leadership has pitted one America against the other and is tearing the nation apart. 
It need not be that way.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets – William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels – he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag Tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.
Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals – just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Photo by Jean Beaufort)I have always been intrigued by Thanksgiving — the traditions, the meal, the idea of a holiday that is simply about being thankful.

For my family, Thanksgiving is all about the food. Some foods, like turkey and mashed potatoes, may be familiar. But there are a few twists. Since I grew up in the Caribbean, I’m allowed a Caribbean dish or two. The reliability of the menu – with a little flexibility sprinkled in – seems to unite us as a family while acknowledging our different cultural backgrounds.
Chances are you and your family have similar traditions. Filipino-American families might include pancit. Russian-American families might serve a side dish of borscht. That’s what makes Thanksgiving unique. It’s a holiday embraced by people regardless of their religion or ethnicity.
Yet despite this adaptability, there’s a core part of the meal that almost everyone embraces. How did this come to be? Although few appreciate it, advertisers have shaped the meal as much as family tradition.
A uniquely broad appeal
When Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Godey’s Lady’s Book, first advocated for Thanksgiving as a national holiday in 1846, she argued that it would unify the country. In our research, my colleagues and I have been able to show that Hale’s vision for the holiday has been largely fulfilled: Inclusivity of people and traditions has been Thanksgiving’s hallmark quality.
A reason for its broad appeal is that it lacks any association with an institutionalized religion. As one interviewee told us, “There is no other purpose than to sit down with your family and be thankful.” And after interviewing a range of people – from those born in the U.S. to immigrants from countries like South Africa, Australia and China – it became obvious that the principles and rituals they embraced during the holiday were universal no matter the culture: family, food and gratitude.
But as a relatively new holiday – one not tied to a religious or patriotic tradition – a shared understanding of the celebration and the meal is crucial to ensure its long-term survival.
While there might be subtle variations, the Thanksgiving meal is the lodestone of the holiday, the magnet that brings people together. Today, familiar items constitute the meal: turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, gravy, alcohol, salad, apple pie and pumpkin pie. Many of our interviewees tended to serve some version of this list.
But why these items and not others? What makes turkey, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie so special? My colleagues and I studied 99 years of Thanksgiving ads in Good Housekeeping magazine to find out.
Marketing a ritual
Starting with Thanksgiving’s early champion, Sarah Josepha Hale, the history of Thanksgiving is rooted in marketing. Marketers not only helped create many of the rituals and cultural myths associated with the Thanksgiving meal, but they also legitimized and maintained them.
Aladdin Cooking Utensils advertises its double roaster in a 1920 issue of Good Housekeeping.

Initially, the Thanksgiving turkey competed with other meats, like duck, chicken and goose, for centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table.
But by the 1920s, turkey had become the only meat advertised. Early ads would focus on how to prepare and present the perfect bird, promoting branded tools like roasters, ranges, pop-up thermometers and oven-cooking bags.
Iconic Swift’s Premium turkey ads focused on the sacredness of the meal by featuring families at prayer, giving thanks before the meal begins. The importance of the turkey to the Thanksgiving celebration dominates, helping to perpetuate the Thanksgiving turkey tradition.
Meanwhile, early ads for the Eatmor Cranberry Company positioned their whole cranberries as a perfect complement to any and all Thanksgiving meat dishes. This brand dominated until the 1930s when another brand, Ocean Spray, entered with its canned gelatin cranberry sauce.

Ads for both brands implied that cranberry sauce has been around since the first Thanksgiving dinner, which was highly unlikely. However, the brand positioning war successfully promoted cranberry sauce as the natural condiment for the Thanksgiving turkey. Ocean Spray would triumph and, to this day, promotes whole cranberries and canned gelatin.
Considered by many to be the quintessential Thanksgiving dessert, pumpkin pie also wasn’t present at the first Thanksgiving meal. (The Pilgrims lacked the butter, wheat flour and sugar to make the pastry.) Nonetheless, beginning as early as 1925, a range of brands – for example, Borden’s, Snowdrift, Mrs. Smith’s and Libby’s – have competed fiercely to connect pumpkin pie to the season, the holiday and the meal. It’s a rivalry that continues to this day.
The role of the consumer
Not every product category or brand succeeded in becoming a core part of the Thanksgiving meal.
A Welch’s ad from the 1960s implies that the first Thanksgiving meal included juice made from grapes. In 1928, Diamond marketed their walnuts as an accessory to dress up Thanksgiving dishes. Despite vociferous ad campaigns, few associate Welch’s grape juice or Diamond walnuts with Thanksgiving today.
But those early 20th-century ads for turkey clearly resonated: Today, nearly 88 percent of U.S. households have turkey on Thanksgiving, and approximately 20 percent of the turkeys consumed in any given year are consumed at Thanksgiving. This is a testament to the enduring influence of marketing on the holiday. For brands like Butterball (formerly Swift’s Premium), Thanksgiving is big business.
Whether you’re a turkey fan or not, prefer apple pie to pumpkin pie, enjoy canned gelatin over whole cranberry sauce, by celebrating Thanksgiving, you play a role as well. Marketers may have shaped many of the rituals of the holiday. But all Americans – from all backgrounds – certainly do their part to maintain them.

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
‘Days of Thanksgiving’ 
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
“The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth” by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.

He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity

	
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”

‘Pardon our national…transgressions’

	
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.

Boxes of tissues were placed throughout the room for that very reason. 
“I think I can declare that this is definitely the best day here in our court,” Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh said at the start of the event. “Too often, what happens in a courtroom, including this one, involves sadness and tears as well as life changing decisions. But today, we replace sadness with joy, but we keep those tears and the life changing decisions for the families this morning.”
Eaton County Probate Judge Amanda Pollard presided over the adoption finalizations for two families from Eaton County.
Jackson Adams, 5, was adopted by his biological grandparents, Timothy and Lori Adams, who have served as his guardians since he was around two years old. Surrounded at the ceremony by other members of their family, they wore pins in memory of Jackson’s biological parents, who are both deceased. 
“We are so grateful that we have had such great help from the legal system and from our family,” Lori Adams said. “We’re here, and thank you.”

Milah and Autumn Woolley, ages 7 and 2, were adopted by their foster parents, Lyonel and Monalisa Woolley, alongside the Woolleys’ older son. Myla and Autumn are sisters and were adopted together at Tuesday’s ceremony, after being with the Woolleys for over two years.
“Since that day, they’ve been a part of my family,” said Lyonel Wooley. “I couldn’t go on without them being a part of my family.”
Pollard heaped praise on the Woolley family.
“I think that they exemplify, from my experience, what we should ask for in foster parents, opening their homes and loving support for kids who are in need of that support,” Pollard said, who presided over the foster case for several years.
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel said, in a speech after the adoption finalizations, that there are around 1800 children in Michigan currently in foster care with the goal of adoption.

“Days like these are such an important reminder of the love and the New Beginnings that adoption can bring to children and families across the state,” Hertel said. “It also serves as an incredibly important reminder to us about why our department and all of our partners continue to do the work that we do connecting kids to adoptive parents when we need to.”
Michigan hosts an Adoption Day ceremony each year. This year’s event, with the theme “Giving Thanks for Families,” marked the 23rd ceremony. 
“It’s a day set aside to shine a spotlight on the adoptions and celebrate the families who are finalizing their journeys today, whether it’s here in the courtrooms or across the state, we want to say congratulations to all the families today,” said Demetrius Starling, senior deputy director at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “Your decision to open your hearts and your homes is a profound act of love, kindness and compassion, hope for all of our children and we thank you for making a lasting difference in a child’s life.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_3132-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 07:58:46.541129

Mike Braun — now governor of Indiana — and U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin were among the 118th Congress’ most effective lawmakers, in an issue-specific analysis by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
The center is a nonpartisan collaboration between the University of Virginia’s Batten School and Vanderbilt University.
Researchers there used 15 indicators of effectiveness to calculate scores for lawmakers who served from January 2023 to 2025. The metrics gauge how many bills a lawmaker sponsored, how substantial the policy proposals within were, and how far those ideas moved though the legislative process.
Then, they identified the top two performers — a Republican and Democrat — across 21 policy areas. The results were published last week.

Braun was named the most effective Senate Republican on housing policy. He got points for sponsoring two “substantive” pieces of housing-related legislation, one of which passed the Senate chamber, but didn’t become law.
Houchin was named the most effective House Republican on education matters. She sponsored one “substantive and significant” education proposal that became law, plus two “substantive” bills that died early on.
Committee chairs are often among best performers, but neither Braun nor Houchin led committees handling their respective top policy areas.
A broader analysis of the 118th Congress, released in March, identified Braun as the ninth-most effective lawmaker in the Senate, as well as the chamber’s fourth-best Republican.
He was lauded for introducing 116 bills, seven of which passed the Senate and four of which became law. Braun was also listed among first-term senators “exceeding expectations” by outperforming a benchmark.
“With Sen. Braun concluding his service in the Senate to become Governor of Indiana in January 2025, it is clear that there will be one less effective lawmaker among the more senior ranks in the Senate moving forward,” researchers wrote at the time.
All members of the 118th Congress, including the rest of Indiana’s delegation, are scored in an online database. They’re ranked by party.
Sen. Todd Young was lower than Braun despite sponsoring nearly three-dozen bills; one passed the Senate but it didn’t become law.
Rep. Larry Bucshon, who retired from the House in January, was the most effective Hoosier overall in that chamber. He was followed by Houchin and former U.S. Rep. Jim Banks, who has since won Braun’s seat in the Senate.
Former Rep. Greg Pence and current Rep. Jim Baird are next. Reps. Rudy Yakym and Victoria Spartz were near the bottom of the 228 Republicans.
Indiana’s two Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Frank Mrvan and André Carson, were also near the bottom of the 220 Democrats.
State lawmakers plan to meet in December to consider redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Those efforts will target Mrvan and Carson.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-27 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,A high-stakes Egg Bowl could be overshadowed by Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin’s future,"Robbie Faulk, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/27/egg-bowl-lane-kiffin/,The Ole Miss Rebels could secure a spot in the College Football Playoff with a win over the Mississippi State Bulldogs in Friday's Egg Bowl.,"STARKVILLE — The 124-year-old football rivalry between Ole Miss and Mississippi State has a new subplot that could very well overshadow what is a high-stakes game in its own right.
The sixth-ranked Rebels (10-1, 6-1 SEC, No. 7 CFP) could lock up a spot in the College Football Playoff with a victory Friday over the Bulldogs (5-6, 1-6) in the Egg Bowl — only to have their celebration muted if coach Lane Kiffin announces after the game that he has decided to leave the program for another suitor.
During the past two weeks, Kiffin family members have traveled from Oxford to both Gainesville, Florida, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while Ole Miss has sought to fend off efforts by Florida and LSU to lure away their coach.
Kiffin and Mississippi athletics director Keith Carter had a meeting last Friday where they reportedly discussed the coach’s future. Carter emerged from that with a public statement that Kiffin was focused on the Egg Bowl and a decision on his future would be announced by Saturday.
The sixth-year Rebels coach has offered little clarity since.
“Keith and I have a great relationship. We communicate daily on a lot of things and I love it here. It’s been amazing,” Kiffin said. “We’re in a season that’s the greatest run in the history of Ole Miss at this point, having never been at this point.
“It’s really exciting. So, I’m just living in the moment,” Kiffin continued. “And our players are, too, you know? I see their joy … about where they’re at and have so much on the line. It’s just awesome to be a part of.”
This is the second time that the rivalry game has been shadowed by Kiffin’s potential exit from Oxford.
In 2022, Kiffin was linked to an opening at Auburn. His Rebels lost to the Bulldogs at home, 24-22, and wound up 8-5, but Kiffin signed an extension with Ole Miss.
Going for gold
A trophy known as the Golden Egg has gone to the winner of this matchup since 1927 — a year after a brawl broke out in Starkville after Ole Miss fans attempted to take down the goal posts.
There has been plenty more vitriol between them since, regardless of what else was at stake for either team.

On Friday, the stakes are higher for the Rebels, but the Bulldogs have a chance to extend their season as well because one more victory would make them bowl eligible in coach Jeff Lebby’s second season.
“We have a bunch of staff members that played here and played inside this game, understand what it’s about,” Lebby said. “The more you can talk about that part of it and guys that have come before and played in between the white lines in this game, they have the ability to communicate to our guys that haven’t been here long and don’t know the history as some of the others.
“It’s great for our entire football team to understand the urgency of what’s at stake,” Lebby added. “You see the guys that are from this state and have played in this game, there’s great pride in how we do what we go do on Friday.”
Recent dominance
Ole Miss has had the better of this rivalry in recent years, winning the past two and four of the past five.
But Kiffin, who had Lebby on his Ole Miss staff earlier this decade, has been impressed by the Bulldogs’ improvement this season.
“Lebby’s done a great job,” Kiffin said, calling him “one of the best offensive minds in football.”
Meanwhile, Kiffin declined to discuss his future this week and said his players have not appeared distracted by the uncertainty surrounding their coach.
“Our team has been very focused since noise has been out there,” Kiffin said. “It’s a different generation … They all can leave every year. A lot of that is financially based. And so, they don’t think the traditional way.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26165940/AP25312799409077.jpg,,,2025-11-27 07:58:46.541129

Town and developers find middle ground after hitting local opposition to housing in a flood hazard zone.

The town of Manchester authorized two nonbinding agreements at a special meeting last Friday that will both conserve a flood prone area and allow needed housing at another site.
Under one part of a memorandum of understanding, Blackacre LLC — which owns the flood prone plot on Richville Road — agreed to come to the table to formalize a deal to donate the eight-acre property proposed for a housing development to the town. A local developer Paul Carroccio, who was consulting with Blackacre LLC, had planned to construct housing on the site. 
The town also agreed to work toward a lease agreement to sell undeveloped land sandwiched between a highway and an abandoned airport to a company owned by Carroccio for the construction of housing and other mixed use development.

The proposed priority housing project highlights the tension between pressing issues faced by the state to push for more housing and plan for natural disasters.  
The project proposal unleashed a torrent of local opposition and sparked questions regarding the application of new legislation to exempt some development from the state’s land use review process.
Manchester town manager Scott Murphy said he is glad the town and developers have kickstarted the public comment period so agreements can be formalized within 90 days. After acquiring an easement to conserve the land in perpetuity, the town plans to transform the eight acres on Richville Road into a community resource for recreation and agriculture, Murphy said.
Ed Gotgart, one of the neighbors who opposed the initial site, said the change of course was a “win-win” for the town and developers. People should not live on a flood hazard overlay district, Gotgart said, but they should be able to use the land for recreation. Plus, the town seeking a conservation easement means the view of “magnificent Mount Equinox” will be preserved, he said.
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, aided Richville Road neighbors who mobilized against the initial housing proposal. While in favor of a conservation easement on the property, Smith cautioned the town against setting up any recreation structures on the land that may exacerbate flooding. 
Murphy said the town had previously sought requests for proposals to develop the undeveloped plot on Airport Road, but acknowledged that extending the water and sewer lines on the site will cost the town $4 to 5 million. Once an agreement is finalized, Carroccio plans to offer $1 million toward the town project.
Of the 60 acres on Airport Road under current town ownership, no more than seven acres will be sold to a third party. Another seven acres is currently conserved for agriculture. The remaining 46 acres could be developed by Carroccio if the parties come to a final agreement. 
In the short term, Carroccio said he plans to construct four to eight of the so-called “workforce” housing units on the Airport Road property, but he said the site could hold over 200 units, including 50 workforce housing units. 
Workforce housing is defined in the Manchester Town Plan as “reasonably priced housing” that is not subsidized, but is targeted toward individuals, families and younger people who want to afford housing in the community they work in. 
Carroccio said that Manchester does not have housing stock that is affordable for people with moderate incomes that are too high to qualify for subsidized, affordable housing projects.
Dom Penges, a neighbor who opposed the original Richville Road development proposal, said the new housing site proposal appears to be a “better one.”
“It’s a nice, beautiful, flat piece of ground close enough to town, but without any hazardous flooding issues,” Penges said “I think if they did it properly — if they come up with guidelines that they could have the developer stand by — I think it would be a great asset for the town.”

But what happens when that plan backfires and accidentally benefits the opposing party instead? Enter what politicos call the “dummymander.”
Republicans in several states, including Missouri, followed President Donald Trump’s orders to redraw congressional maps to protect the GOP’s House majority. To do it, they carved up blue seats and dispersed those Democratic voters into deep red districts, making many hue more towards pink.
Earlier this month, Democrats scored massive wins across the country — seen by many as a rebuke of the president and the prelude to a blue wave in next year’s midterms. Could that wave be large enough to turn carefully constructed GOP maps into a dummymander?
Republicans worried about that very scenario in Missouri two years ago, when state senators rejected a map that would have given the GOP seven of the state’s eight congressional seats. They feared a 7-1 map could swing to a 5-3 map if political winds shifted.
Those concerns were set aside in September when the legislature redrew the map to break up the Kansas City-based 5th District represented by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver.
So does this make Missouri a prime candidate for a dummymander?
Probably not.
The key difference between 2022, when the 7-1 map was deemed too risky, and 2025, when it was approved, is the retirement of Republican U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer. His rural St. Elizabeth home made it difficult to keep him in his district while maintaining a GOP advantage everywhere else.
Luetkemeyer’s replacement, Bob Onder, lives in the St. Louis suburbs, making a gerrymander easier.
Under the new lines, the previously Democratic 5th District would have voted for Trump by 18 percentage points last year, said Erin Covey of Cook Political Report, a national nonpartisan newsletter that analyzes election trends. And Trump would have won the new 4th District — which now includes more Democratic voters from Kansas City — by 21 percentage points.
Even the 2nd District, long targeted by Democrats, became redder under the new map. Covey said the new 2nd District would have voted for Trump by 11 points, compared to 8 points before.
She notes that the last time the U.S. saw a blue wave — in 2018 — the reddest seat Democrats flipped was in a New York district Trump won by 15 points.
Now, all this could ultimately be moot. A referendum campaign is raising millions to put the new map on the 2026 ballot, which could freeze the current districts in place until an up-or-down statewide vote.
But if the new map stands, Missouri Democrats shouldn’t be so discouraged that they don’t recruit and run strong candidates, said Kyle Kondik of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, which also provides nonpartisan political analysis at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
“If the wave comes,” Kondik said, “you want as many surfboards in the water as possible.”
Look no further than Tennessee, where Democrats are contesting a special election for a U.S. House seat Trump carried by 22 points. Despite the district’s deep red tilt, Democrats are making a play, hoping an anti-Trump electorate is ready to rebuke the party in power.
As both parties brace for the chaos of 2026, one thing’s clear: in the game of gerrymandering, the only certainty is that the lines will always keep shifting.

(Photo courtesy of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Department of Corrections may soon have a new tool to eliminate the use of contraband cellphones among inmates following a decision from the Federal Communications Commission.
Kay Thompson, an Oklahoma Department of Corrections spokesperson, said the agency is in talks with different companies to provide technology to jam cellphone signals within state prisons.
The FCC earlier this year advanced a proposal that for the first time could allow state prisons to use cellphone jamming technology to block phone signals amid a rise in contraband phones in prisons. The federal agency announced it is taking public comments on proposed rules, a step necessary to allow the jamming technology.
Thompson said contraband cellphones are a growing problem in Oklahoma prisons.
From January to August, the agency confiscated 4,475 cellphones, she said.

Inmates use the phones to coordinate violence, harass victims and for other criminal activity, she said.
“Being able to use jamming technology is another tool to help us combat cellphones, which will negatively impact the introduction of all contraband and make our facilities safer for both staff and inmates,” said Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Justin Farris.
Cellphones are often smuggled into prison by visitors, staff or with drones. Drones drop them onto prison property, Thompson said.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond and 12 other attorneys general sent the federal agency a letter in support allowing jamming devices.
Current FCC interpretation of federal rules prohibits the use of jamming devices in prisons, his office said. A 1934 federal law allows only federal authorities the authority to block public airwaves.
“It’s time that our rules and policies catch up with the needs of 21st century technology and stop any and all criminal activity from occurring through illicit means of communication within our prison walls,” Drummond said in a press release.
Thompson said the agency does not anticipate asking lawmakers for additional funds to implement a program to jam cellphones behind prison walls because it has enough money in its technology budget. However, some other projects may need to be put on hold, she said. 
“We don’t know what the technology is going to be or even an estimated cost at this point,” Thompson said.
A past concern was that jamming devices could impact users outside of prison boundaries.
But Thompson said technology has evolved to a point where the jamming devices can be targeted and not impact those outside prisons.
She said the project would not impact staff because employees are already prohibited from bringing in cellphones. 
Thompson said the jamming technology would be rolled out starting with the maximum-security Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester and then into larger, medium-secure facilities.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The Elver Park Neighborhood Center on the far southwest side of Madison has long been a familiar and welcome source of help for Joeniece Jackson and her four children.
Her oldest, now 14, attended the center’s after-school programs from an early age, as have her other three kids. And Joeniece says she’s enjoyed volunteering as well, or bringing the children of friends who may need child care unexpectedly.
But in the last few years, the center has served another purpose as well — as a food pantry for families who need to stretch their family meal budgets.
“The food pantry has gotten us through some of our hard times,” Jackson says.
The Elver Park after-school program isn’t the only one doing double duty. Across Wisconsin, other after-school programs have added food pantry services to their offerings for families who may not be able to afford to keep their cupboards full.
“After-school programs have long been doing after-school meals and snacks for kids,” says Daniel Gage of the Wisconsin Out of School Time Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of after-school programs. Food pantry programs are a newer addition to that work. “After-school programs tend to be a place where people come together as parents are coming to pick up their kids.”
The recent federal shutdown, when federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Payments were halted Nov. 1, exacerbated the need. With the shutdown finished and SNAP funds flowing again, that has eased off, but only slightly.
The Elver Park Neighborhood Center and its after-school program are run by the Wisconsin Youth Company. The agency operates two neighborhood centers in Madison along with school-based after-school programs in Dane County and  Waukesha County.
Elver Park’s food pantry began operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools were closed and, for a time, the center’s after-school programs were on hold as well, according to Takela Harper, the assistant director of centers for Wisconsin Youth Company.
Originally the center partnered with the Madison Metropolitan School District to deliver food to school district families who needed it, Harper said. When schools and after-school programs reopened, the program converted to a store-style food pantry, where families come on Tuesdays and Thursdays to pick up donations of packaged as well as fresh foods.
At Elver Park, there’s been “a consistent flow” in traffic for the last couple of years, Harper says. But that doubled in October from the previous month, with about 30 to 50 families a week coming in for assistance.
In Nekoosa, located in Wood County in North Central Wisconsin, the Nekoosa School District launched a food pantry a year ago. The city has a population of about 2,500 and the school district an enrollment of just over 1,200.
Nikki Stearns organized the Nekoosa program while serving in Americorps with the local YMCA. Her Americorps assignment had her working with elementary school-age children, and she soon learned the extent of hunger in some of those kids.
“So many of my kids are hungry,” Stearns said. “I started bringing in snacks, and other teachers started bringing in snacks for students, too.”
A 2023 United Way report on ALICE families in the community — families on the edge and vulnerable to falling into poverty — documented how pervasive families are who cannot count on regular meals or an adequate supply of food .  
“In Nekoosa, 53% of our community is either living in poverty or one paycheck away,” Stearns says.
In the Nekoosa program, families who sign up receive a box of food each month. Some are also enrolled in FoodShare — Wisconsin’s name for the state’s SNAP benefits program. When SNAP payments stopped Nov. 1, however, the food pantry’s signups shot up.
Through September and October, the Nekoosa program served 38 people — eight to 10 families, Stearns said. That jumped to more than 50 in November after SNAP benefits stopped.
“The first day when SNAP benefits weren’t uploaded to people’s [electronic benefits] cards, I think I had 35 applications come in in one day,” Stearns said.
 “Now we’re serving about 200 people.” Even with the resumption of SNAP after the end of the shutdown, the demand has not diminished significantly, she added.
The Nekoosa food pantry program had been housed with the YMCA after-school program, based at a middle school. In June, the school transferred the food pantry program to the operation of the YMCA, which moved it to share space with the Y’s child care program, where recipients pick up their monthly boxes of food.
Providing a monthly allotment of food proved to be the most practical way for the Nekoosa program to operate, Stearns said, because “I don’t always know what [food] donations we’ll get or how much funding we’ll have to support people.”
The Nekoosa program was launched as part of a Wisconsin Partnership Program grant that the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health made to the Marshfield Clinic. With the $500,000 grant, the clinic was able to fund seven projects across the state’s northern half to address food insecurity.
“When students are fed and have those basic needs met, with food as one of those basic needs, they certainly can learn and focus so much more,” says Jill Niemczyk, a health educator with the Marshfield Clinic’s Center for Community Health Advancement who has been coordinating the program.
Other projects included a food pantry expansion, a teen meal program, gardening projects and a variety of nutrition education and community engagement programs.
“Each one of our seven sites is doing something a little bit different,” Niemczyk says.
The grant is now in its second year. In the third and final year, she says, attention will turn to assisting the various recipients as they look at how to establish ongoing community support and build on what they have been doing.
Even with SNAP benefits restored with temporary legislation to fund the federal government through January, Stearns expects the need to address hunger and food insecurity to persist.
“I think a lot of people are feeling like the food crisis is addressed” because the shutdown ended, Stearns says. “But a lot of us in food security are nervous about January. There’s a pretty big need to focus on people being fed — students are going to school hungry, whether there’s FoodShare or not.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The other day I spoke with a dear friend I’ve known since I was 21. As we compared Thanksgiving plans, I described my usual traditional menu: turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, salad, cranberry relish, pie – the comforting repertoire my husband and mother insist on. I don’t have strong feelings about the menu, but I love making people happy, and I do love gravy.
My friend, though, was headed to a community “pitch-in.” Her assigned dish? Mashed potatoes. Yet, in her 80s now, her hands were hurting, and she didn’t feel up to making the smooth, whipped, traditional version. Instead, she planned to bring what she called “chunky, smashed, skin-on Yukon gold potatoes.” Just potatoes boiled and smashed with butter, salt and pepper.
“Sounds great,” I said. But she was anxious. She feared her dinner companions would want potatoes “like Grandma made,” and worse, that they’d judge her deviation from the script. She didn’t believe they would be grateful for her contribution; she feared they might be annoyed. She even asked if I’d write a poem for her to give her fellow diners to help “curb” the change.
Her worry was both touching and deeply familiar. I had just finished teaching a course on leading through disruption and change for MBA students in the Iowa State University Ivy College of Business. We spent weeks discussing how the pace of change, whether from geopolitical, technological, organizational or cultural shifts, is accelerating, and what that means for leaders. Research consistently shows that humans resist change as a survival mechanism; often, the more disruption we experience, the more we cling to the familiar. As a result, in times of turbulence, we yearn for reliable anchors: a workplace that feels predictable, technology we understand, mashed potatoes just like Grandma used to make. Consistency give us comfort, identity, and a sense of continuity when the world feels unsteady.
Yet leadership in the modern world requires helping people acknowledge that change is both inevitable and constant. Change itself is neither inherently good nor bad, but it is unstoppable. We can yell into the sky: “No more change!” – but that will not slow anything down. We can only control our own reaction to it. Instead of assuming the worst and resisting, leaders must acknowledge the change as real and cultivate adaptability, nimbleness and emotional intelligence. We must learn to communicate in an empathic and human-centric way, and to help others navigate ambiguity, see new possibilities, and even discover gratitude for what the new can bring.
Gratitude may seem like an odd companion to turbulence, but research shows it is foundational to effective leadership. In an article called, “How to Show More Gratitude at Work: Giving Thanks Makes You a Better Leader,”The Center for Creative Leadership notes that leaders who express gratitude build trust, wellbeing, and engagement in their teams. And new studies from the University of Florida reveal that when leaders reflect on gratitude received from family members, they show more empowering and supportive behaviors at work. Gratitude literally broadens our mindset, both psychologically and biochemically, making us more resilient and more connected both professionally and in our personal lives.
At the same time, gratitude must be balanced. As Harvard Business Review scholars Lan Nguyen Chaplin and Mike Chisholm note, excessive gratitude can become a trap, making people hesitant to self-advocate or voice legitimate concerns. The key is not blind positivity but “empowered gratitude,” where appreciation coexists with ambition, boundaries, and honest reflection. Leaders must model this balance: grateful for what has been and what is, yet willing to ask for what might be better.
This, too, mirrors the tension many of us feel around family traditions during the holidays. My Thanksgiving table is smaller now. Our family is dispersed and others who we shared the traditional meal with have moved or passed away. I miss the siblings, stepchildren, and friends who once filled the room and feel the ache of change. And yet, there are unexpected gifts: less rushing, fewer dishes to wash, quieter conversations, more leftovers. I loved the old traditions, but I also love the new ones emerging in their place.
Which brings me back to my friend and her “modern” potatoes. They are not the whipped clouds of childhood memory, but they carry their own warmth: creative, rustic, honest. They reflect her changing abilities, her desire to show up anyway, her willingness to contribute in a way that honors both tradition and reality. I hope her fellow diners greet her potatoes with delight rather than comparison; I hope they practice gratitude for the spirit behind the dish, not the perfection of the recipe.
Because this is the real leadership lesson, whether in organizations or around a crowded buffet table. We want the comfort of tradition, but the pace of life requires us to accept and even embrace the new. Gratitude helps us bridge the gap between what was and what is becoming. It steadies us as we adapt, and it softens us as others do the same.
So this Thanksgiving, may we savor both the familiar and the unexpected. May we honor Grandma’s recipes while welcoming chunky, smashed, Yukon-gold innovations. And may we practice the kind of gratitude that strengthens us for change: generous, grounded and open to whatever new flavors arrive on the table.



Here is the poem I wrote for my friend’s Thanksgiving:
Giving Thanks for Chunky Smashed Yukon Gold Potatoes
O beloved presence at the heart of the universe,
today I lift my spoon and my spirit
in gratitude for the humble potato,
that golden oracle of comfort.
Thank you for spuds that shape-shift with our moods:
fried with a sizzle, French fried with flair,
deep fried into celebratory crunch,
hash browned at sunrise, tater totted for joy,
cubed for soups, or layered in creamy devotion.
For baked beauties bursting with generosity,
and for the holiday mound of butter-kissed mashed potatoes
Grandma conjured with her quiet magic,
I give thanks.
But the world keeps spinning, full of surprise and reinvention.
My hands, marked by age and experience, welcome change.
So today I honor the modern potato,
the chunky, skin-on Yukon gold,
earthy and honest, tender with bits of truth.
A reminder that life is not always smooth,
but textured, real, and rooted.
Variety surrounds us, tradition gently bends,
perfection is unnecessary, and choice is abundant.
Giving thanks again and again strengthens us.
And may this humble, chunky Yukon gold remind us
that we too can evolve,
soft in some places, textured in others,
honoring where we have been
while embracing where we are going.
For in every potato and every moment
there is proof that we can rise, grow,
and remake ourselves
beautifully, bravely,
bursting with flavor,
blessed with favor.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)When Alex Adams stepped into his role leading the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in June 2024, he immediately announced a laser focus on foster care. 
Adams, nominated by President Donald Trump in March and last month confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Administration for Children and Families assistant secretary, is now taking a similar approach to his federal position. 
On Monday, the federal administration announced the launch of “A Home for Every Child,” an initiative to bring up the ratio of foster children to foster homes to 1-to-1.  
“Our Home for Every Child initiative nationally is really modeled off of what we did here in Idaho,” Adams said in an interview Wednesday in Boise.  
As the state Health and Welfare director, Adams focused on policies to improve recruitment and retention of foster families as well as to prevent children from entering the system when possible, the Idaho Press reported. While his role now is more of an “overseer,” rather than provider of foster care services, he said he wants to focus on the same goals. 
Many of his goals are outlined in a federal executive order signed Nov. 13 by Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. 
 Adams hopes to start by collecting the right data, doing away with the rest 

Around two months into the new job, Adams said he’s hoping to start the new initiative by learning exactly how many foster homes there are nationwide. 
“We don’t have good data on the number of homes nationally,” he said. “We require 200 data points from each state to be reported to us at the federal government, but homes is not one of them.” 
Adams cited the nonprofit foster family counting project from the news outlet the Imprint, showing there are about 57 foster homes per 100 youth in the system nationwide. He’s working on ensuring states are counting how many available foster homes they have. 
The administration is also in the process of evaluating how many of the required data points are necessary for states to continue to report. 
“Accountability for federal taxpayer dollars is important, but right now we’re collecting too much from states that we don’t do anything with,” he said. “… I want to start clearing away that brush so that the front-end service providers can spend more of their time and energy on things that actually benefit children, as opposed to just box checking and hoop jumping.” 
As part of the executive order, the federal agency was directed to identify and eliminate “unnecessary high-cost and low-value reporting requirements.” Adams said his agency has submitted ideas to reduce reporting requirements but couldn’t discuss them until they were approved.

 It’s up to the states to determine how to improve foster home ratio

The administration provides between $11 billion and $12 billion to state child welfare systems. The federal administration can create financial incentives and provide guidance, technical assistance and best practices, but Adams expects states to create their own plans to achieve the goal. 
His office is beginning to meet with state directors of health agencies or child welfare departments to start conversations around the goals and get their input before he launches specific directives. 
He highlighted his work in Idaho, which included policies to make it easier to find and license family members, or kin, increased recruitment through faith-based organizations, and added resources and services for foster parents.

He also focused heavily on prevention. During the 2025 legislative session, the child welfare budget included 36 new full-time employees for the prevention specialist team. Adams said at the time the majority of young people were entering the foster system because of mental health or substance abuse issues, and he wanted to focus on providing services to parents in the home to prevent their children’s removal. 
 There’s ‘right’ and ‘wrong ways’ to focus on prevention, Adams says 

Adams highlighted Idaho’s work in prevention, but said there are “wrong ways” to do it. 
In Idaho, prevention policies coincided with a court decision that limited law enforcement’s ability to remove children from homes; these factors, combined with the pandemic, led to a “perfect storm,” that seems to have resulted in increasingly severe abuse cases of children entering the foster system, foster child advocates previously told the Sun. 
Adams said the administration is also working on about seven measures for states to implement alongside their policies to improve foster child-to-home ratios, to track indicators of child safety. 
“I’ve been on the job for about six weeks at this point, but suffice it to say, child safety is our number one priority at (the Administration for Children and Families),” Adams said. “And as we lean into this and try to get a home for every child, making sure it’s done the right way, which is why it’s going to be really important the seven safety measures that we wrap around this.” 
 Idaho among first states to implement ‘predictive analytics’ in foster care

Next week, the federal administration will begin meetings about the use of predictive analytics in child welfare, Adams said. 
The tool uses technology such as AI to help determine more quickly the best placement for a foster child, and move them more quickly toward permanency, either through adoption or reunification. 
Idaho is one of the first states working to implement the tool, Adams said. 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Division of Youth Safety and Permanency Administrator Jean Fisher told the Sun in October that the state agency was in the process of training in what are called “poor prognosis indicators.” 
“They’re national indicators that would really be able to help our social workers critically think through cases where they, based on what those indicators are, might understand the case a little bit better from an earlier perspective that this case clearly has some reunification efforts that are very strong,” Fisher said.
 Adams plans to address state foster systems’ use of children’s Social Security benefits 

Adams is also gathering information about a nationwide practice of state welfare programs — including Idaho — collecting Social Security survivors’ and disability benefits entitled to foster children and using them to pay for their care. 
Idaho foster youth didn’t receive Social Security money they’re entitled to. That will soon change. 

Adams, as Idaho’s health director, issued a directive in May for the agency to halt the practice by July 1, 2026. He said Wednesday he’s now hoping to address it in his federal position. 
“It’s very difficult to see any scenario in which you can morally justify, a child whose parents died, the parent having earned a Social Security survivor’s benefit, the child being entitled to that benefit, and then the state agency saying, ‘I’ll take that,’” Adams said. 
The magnitude of the issue is hard to quantify, he said, because the money collected tends to get lumped with other federal benefits. 
“The overall pie is estimated at about $160 million, but I have states that are telling me this might be 10% to 30% of the overall pie,” he said. 
He’s begun by telling directors it’s happening, because he’s found some who were unaware. There’s not currently a specific plan to address it. 
“I think the first thing I’m trying to do is get my arms around the magnitude of this,” he said, “because once you figure out the magnitude of it, then you can calibrate actions that are responsive to that.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_6203-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 06:57:02.141584

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)LINCOLN — The 43-day federal government shutdown this year left a period of uncertainty for Nebraskans receiving food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, including a failed special session call at the request of some state lawmakers.
Many local communities, churches and nonprofits stepped up during the longest shutdown on record. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen made clear that Nebraska would not pick up the federal bill, a difference from leaders in some other states who released emergency funds. President Donald Trump also refused to use contingency funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
“Nobody’s going to go hungry,” Pillen said at a Nov. 6 news conference.

Days later, in his monthly call-in show Nov. 10 with the Nebraska Broadcaster’s Association, Pillen confirmed: “We, the state, are not going to provide SNAP benefits, pure and simple, if the federal government doesn’t.”
The shutdown ended when Trump signed a new spending bill late Nov. 12.
Special session needed 33 supporters
A group of 15 state lawmakers — 14 Democrats and the Legislature’s one nonpartisan progressive — had tried to force a special session to make Pillen cover SNAP payments and fund Head Start preschool and nutrition programs. 
The lawmaker-sought session also pushed for general changes in state law to address the rising costs of food, household necessities and other essential goods. Only items specified in a special session call can be considered during such a session. Had it been successful, it would have been the Unicameral’s first senator-initiated special session.

But by the 5 p.m. deadline on Nov. 14, no more senators had signed on to the special session call. The letter from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha needed at least 18 more senators to agree that a special session was warranted.
“I still think that it was important to do, to show the people of Nebraska that legislators were trying to do something to help alleviate the burden everybody is under,” said Cavanaugh, who led the special session call.
The lone Democratic lawmaker not to join the call was State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, who told the Nebraska Examiner he supported the effort but couldn’t confirm his support as he was out of the country.
‘Bad news of SNAP benefits’
Had the shutdown continued, Pillen said Nebraska would have picked up the $100,000-a-day cost for WIC, the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program that supports low-income pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding mothers, as well as qualifying infants and children up to age five.

Pillen said Nebraskans take care of each other and that he was “old and long enough in the tooth” to remember when neighbors and churches helped one another, a “better” model than government involvement. He repeatedly said Nebraska would “go back the way we used to do it years ago, before the government got involved.”
The country’s first “Food Stamp Program” began in 1939 and ended in 1943, according to USDA. A revised pilot program came in 1961, when Pillen was five years old. It became permanent in 1964.
“The bad news of SNAP benefits,” Pillen told one caller to his Nov. 10 show, was “unfortunately, you’re living more in isolation, and nobody knows you need help, and it’s hard to ask for help.”
Pillen urged the caller to reach out to churches, food banks and other Nebraskans stepping up. He said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services was “standing on top of” the situation, but that Nebraska was not the federal government.

The next caller, a staffer for the Nebraska Democratic Party, told Pillen his answer was a “cop out.” Pillen responded that when Nebraskans know someone is in need, they help.
“If you just stand there and think the government is going to solve every problem, no,” Pillen said. “That’s not a ‘cop out.’ Pun intended, thinking the government is going to feed everybody is hogwash.”
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., a Democrat, was among many local officials organizing community responses. His office launched and helped a citywide food drive with city and county officials directing available funds to nonprofits and community partners.
‘Why pay taxes anymore?’
Cavanaugh said lawmakers had “no idea” when the shutdown was going to end or what would happen with SNAP. Come Oct. 31, with slightly more clarity about how the federal government would respond, or wouldn’t, she and her colleagues decided not to wait.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee with Cavanaugh, said the special session call was meant to provide leadership, because Nebraskans were in need.
“We’re glad that it’s restored for folks now, and that doesn’t change the crisis that we are coming into,” Spivey said.

State law requires the Nebraska secretary of state to forward a special session request to all other lawmakers and solicit responses if the initial call is made by at least 10 lawmakers. State senators then have 10 days to join.
Cavanaugh’s group sent an identical request Nov. 3, which reset the 10-day clock. Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s office emailed and mailed the request to all other lawmakers the next day with a Nov. 14 deadline. If successful, Pillen would have needed to convene the Legislature within five days of Evnen’s confirmation.
Cavanaugh said she was “disappointed” in the lack of lawmaker responses, especially after she talked to “several” Republican colleagues who she thought would be supportive.
“I question why pay taxes anymore if our taxes are supposed to go to public good and to support our most vulnerable populations … and they’re not,” Cavanaugh said. “They’re going to corporate welfare and to the 1%.”
‘Our community stepped up’
One of those senators Cavanaugh talked to was State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who has supported food assistance programs, including an early 2024 call to force Pillen to permanently participate in a pandemic-era summer food program for low-income families. Pillen later reversed and signed up.

A SNAP-focused special session would cost money and would have come as the state continues to dig out of a budget hole, Hughes said. The Pillen-ordered session focused on property taxes in summer 2024 cost $9,529 per day. 
Hughes said a new special session likely wouldn’t have gotten fully underway until this week or later.
“Well, call me crazy, but I just really feel like this will be resolved before anything would happen special session-wise,” Hughes recalled telling Cavanaugh.
Hughes told the Examiner: “I would just be sick if we spent money on something that was not necessary.”
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, gave a similar assessment on why he didn’t join the special session call.

State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, another Republican who has worked with Hughes, progressive lawmakers and others on food assistance in the past, said he felt the shutdown was nearing an end when the call reached his mailbox. But had the shutdown continued for “months and months,” he said lawmakers would have needed to act. 
Brandt, a farmer representing a rural district in southeast Nebraska, also noted that the United States is the richest country in the world and said it’s “obscene” that anyone goes without food.
“I don’t want to see anybody go hungry,” Brandt said.
Hughes said she was confident Washington, D.C., couldn’t be shut down that long and that she was delighted by how many Nebraskans were ramping up services, increasing food donations and expanding community outreach, including in her Seward-area district.
“For this one month of delay, I feel like our community stepped up and filled the gap,” Hughes said.
‘Limited bucket of funds’
Chelsea Salifou, CEO of Omaha-based Heartland Hope Mission, said the return of SNAP benefits has not yet equated to stabilization. 
During the SNAP delay and uncertainty, many turned to food pantries but were unable to get certain necessities or baby items, so some families used dollars that would have otherwise gone toward housing and utility bills, Salifou said.
While trying to catch up, many face rent shortages and power shut-off threats. 
“There is a limited bucket of funds to help with those things,” said Salifou, whose organization provides a wide range of resources beyond groceries. 
Questions, concerns cloud Nebraska SNAP food benefits, despite judge’s order

She said the nonprofit’s Christmas gift registration list signals tough times ahead. Currently, about 8,000 kids are registered, she said, about a 30% increase over last year at this time.
“Our biggest concern right now is housing stability for these families that have gotten behind on rent because of delayed SNAP benefits,” Salifou said.
Concern is escalated by the permanent loss of SNAP and medical benefits for refugees and others due to changes resulting from President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law, which Trump and allies called “big” and “beautiful,” says Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity, which works with refugee communities.
The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that some 6,300 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status are losing food aid benefits altogether.
Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited almost exclusively to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, currently participate in SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible.
“It’s going to be bad,” said Vlach.
Support for refugees
Vlach’s organization on Wednesday launched a “Feed a Family” campaign, asking faith communities, organizations and households to sponsor refugee families who have permanently lost public food assistance.

The effort comes on the heels of a memo from the Trump administration calling for an unprecedented review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, affecting potentially 230,000 refugees who entered the U.S. between 2021 and 2025 after going through a rigorous admissions process.
A signal of need locally, said Vlach, is illustrated by a donation she received Tuesday of this week, a $700 batch of gift cards. They were gone two minutes after she put out the word they were available, she said.
Many of the refugee families seeking assistance are large, with 10 children, she said. 
One beacon of hope, Vlach said, is that families should be getting income tax refunds back early next year, which could help sustain them for a short while.
2026 session on the horizon
Clements said the federal changes were “pretty minor” in his view and that Nebraska’s split on covering Medicaid costs with the federal government didn’t decrease, unlike last year, a major component of the latest budget hole that lawmakers filled this spring.

SNAP administrative costs will increase for Nebraska as a result of federal spending changes, but Clements said those can be absorbed into the state budget.
“I was pleased with how the federal changes were not severe to us,” Clements said. “We have enough other challenges with the budget.”
Spivey disagreed and said, “We can’t cut our way out of it.” 
She said lawmakers will need to focus on spending priorities, which she argued should include child care, housing and other social safety nets. Cavanaugh said she’s approaching her last session in 2026 with a “very heavy heart” and feels it’s been a “losing battle” to get lawmakers to “care more.”
Spivey said she hopes lawmakers leave party politics behind.
“The beauty and the history and intention of our institution is that we work across the aisle and we have conversations, even if people don’t agree,” Spivey said. “My hope is that I can continue to work hand in hand with all of my colleagues around really important issues facing Nebraskans.”

Silas Wilbur remembers fishing for trout on the Little Salmon River as a kid. His parents owned a ranch on the Little Salmon, north of New Meadows, and he used to visit frequently.  
“I used to catch a lot of trout on the river, that was really fun,” Wilbur says. “You can’t catch any trout in that stream now.”
Wilbur grew up in Weiser, and his parents ran Texas longhorn cattle on the Meadows Valley property. “That’s some of the best grass in the state,” he notes.

When his parents reached retirement age, they leased out the ranch. During the COVID years, Silas and his wife, April, made a permanent move to the family ranch in Meadows Valley.  
They’re still raising cattle on the ranch, and they also have chickens, goats and a llama named Reba. 
“We like cattle, but it’s not our first priority, honestly,” Silas Wilbur says. “As soon as we moved up there, we’ve been working on fixing up the place and doing some restoration work on the landscape.” 
The Wilburs approached the Natural Resources Conservation Service to learn about what federal assistance might be available. They also had a fortuitous visit from Wes Keller of McCall, who works in the fisheries department for the Nez Perce Tribe. In talking to Keller, they realized that the Nez Perce Tribe had a similar vision for restoring the Little Salmon River to improve riparian habitat for resident fish, steelhead and endangered salmon. 
“They used to call this area Chinook Meadows,” noted their neighbor to the north, Kurt Kroll. “I dearly love that place, I’m very grateful to have it.” 
Kroll bought his ranch property four years ago. He also has a strong interest in the restoring the property to improve the riparian area and enhance water quality in the Little Salmon River. 
Keller talked to Wendy Green, chair of the Adams Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors, about his conversations with the Wilburs and Kroll. To help improve the Little Salmon River water quality and riparian area fits the district’s mission. 
“This section of the Little Salmon is a 303 (d)-listed stream due to temperature, sediment and nutrient loads,” Green said. “We welcomed the opportunity to work with willing landowners to help improve water quality.”
 A habitat restoration project — the Idaho way

Green suggested that they could apply for a Water Quality Program for Agriculture grant from the Idaho Soil and Water Conservation Commission to install fencing along the Little Salmon to exclude cattle. 
In addition to protecting streambanks from livestock, the riparian buffer would support the Nez Perce Tribe’s effort to plant shrubs and trees to begin the restoration effort. The tribe had significant resources from a larger grant to restore fisheries in the Salmon and Clearwater river basins. But they wanted to make sure that the riparian plantings would be protected from cattle grazing. The fencing project made all of that possible.
“Our goal is to always help our local landowners find resources to accomplish conservation and restoration projects,” said Charlie Munden, a supervisor on the Adams Soil and Water Conservation District board. “We were happy to help.”
The Adams district applied for and received a $23,800 Water Quality Program for Agriculture grant to purchase 1.25 miles of fencing to begin restoration work on 385 acres of land in the Little Salmon River corridor shared by Kroll and the Wilburs. Plus, the Nez Perce Tribe owns 37 acres of land immediately to the north of those properties to tie more conservation projects together. 
The riparian fencing was installed in the late fall of 2024. The first round of riparian trees and shrubs were planted by a variety of volunteers in September 2025. 
“We’ve been really thrilled with the project so far,” said April Wilbur. “It’s been really wonderful.”
“It’s a beautiful piece of river – I can’t wait to see how things improve over time,” Kroll says.
“The end goal aligned perfectly for all of us,” added Silas Wilbur. “We all want a healthy river. It feels like a win-win-win project all the way around.”

 Background: Little Salmon River water quality issues

The Little Salmon River flows north for 45 miles from its headwaters south of New Meadows to its confluence with the main Salmon River near Riggins. The Upper Little Salmon River segment extends 12.5 miles, from Big Creek in the south downstream to Round Valley Creek. This stream segment is on the state’s list of degraded waters (§303(d) list) because it does not meet minimum standards for water temperature, bacteria and nutrients, the Adams district’s grant application noted.
“The proposed Meadows Valley Riparian Fencing Project is the necessary first phase of a comprehensive plan to reduce agricultural impacts and restore beneficial uses in the heart of the Little Salmon River segment that flows through the Meadows Valley,” Wendy Green wrote in the application. 
The Wilbur family’s property has 270 acres and 1.4 miles of Little Salmon River in the project area. Kroll has 116 acres and .6 miles of the river in the project area. With the Water Quality Program for Agriculture funding and $13,232 in landowner cost-share contributions, the landowners installed 6,573 feet of riparian fence to restore and protect 1.25 miles of the listed stream, along with significant wetlands. 
Livestock are being excluded from 132 acres on both properties. The project also features the following benefits: 

 It will meet or exceed a 42-meter riparian buffer in this reach as recommended in the Little Salmon River Total Maximum Daily Load Implementation Plan for Agriculture, 2008.
 It protects more than 15 acres of existing wetlands on the two parcels.
 It allows for future managed grazing in the riparian pastures, once shrubs have become established and streambanks have stabilized.

 What difference will the project make for water quality? 

Fencing cattle off streambanks can make a significant improvement in water quality. According to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the fencing project will reduce sediment loads by 79 tons per year, nitrogen by 254 pounds per year, and phosphorus by 127 pounds per year.
Both landowners have met with the Natural Resources Conservation Service and begun the process of applying for EQIP federal funds in order to develop off-stream stockwater facilities, improve aging irrigation infrastructure, and refine their grazing plans.
In addition, the Nez Perce Tribe’s Watershed Division has offered expertise, labor, and plant materials to help restore riparian shrubs along the protected river reach. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through its Idaho Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, has offered to provide equipment and staff time to assist with implementing BMPs. The Adams district has water-jet stingers available to aid in riparian planting, as well. 
“This restoration effort is going to require all hands on deck, and we have received enthusiastic support from many willing partners,” Green said in the Adams Water Quality Program for Agriculture application. 
Indeed, the tribe’s staff and volunteers from local schools, Idaho Fish and Game, the Forest Service, Alzar School in Cascade, and the University of Idaho Master Gardener program planted more than 500 trees and shrubs in the fall of 2025. Many more plantings are planned in 2026 and beyond. 
The Wilburs signed a contract with the Nez Perce Tribe that details the types of trees and shrubs that will be planted in the Little Salmon River riparian area over time. All told, more than 9,600 trees and shrubs are scheduled to be planted in the next five years. The trunks of the trees were protected with a mesh material to prevent deer from eating them. 
Plantings will include:

Thin-leaf alder 
Serviceberry
Birch
Red dogwood
Black cottonwood
Aspens
Six different species of willows 

Keller was out of the country when contacted for this story and was not available to comment. But Silas Wilbur gives him a lot of credit for pulling all of the partners together for the Little Salmon River restoration project. 
“Wes was really excited after our initial conversation, knowing that we all had a similar long-term vision for the Little Salmon River,” Wilbur said. “He worked his butt off on this project, quite frankly. We could not have done it financially without the WQPA grant and the tribe’s assistance.” 
“I’m starting to see positive changes in the river already,” he says. “I’m looking forward to catching trout in the Little Salmon once again.” 
“Things are looking good so far,” added Kroll. “I’m looking forward to seeing how things look 5 years from now. I think those plantings are going to grow up and thrive, and we should see a real positive change in the water quality of the river. Hopefully, someday, we’ll see steelhead and chinook spawning up here.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)In the summer of 2024, Arthur Barnard was invited to throw out the first pitch at a Boston Red Sox game. 
It was the first time he’d been to a professional baseball game since the 1980s, but he wasn’t there to just reconnect with America’s pastime. Barnard was among a handful of gun violence survivors and advocates invited onto the mound that day, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. 
Looking around the stadium, his first thought was of the size of the crowd. He estimated there were probably more than 40,000 people — which he noted was close to the 44,000 people who died from gun violence in America that year. 
Barnard thinks that way because his son, Arthur Strout, was one of the 18 people killed in the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston. 
Not even 24 hours after the shooting, Barnard said he knew he was going to take action. He didn’t know what it would look like, but he just started talking to people. He asked if there is a network for families affected by mass shootings, which led him to connect with a man whose daughter died in the Parkland High School shooting in Florida. 
Less than three months later, Barnard spoke at a press conference at the State House in Augusta in support of stronger gun laws. Thinking back, he said it felt like a circus with thousands of people crammed into the Hall of Flags. 
“This is not about taking guns,” Barnard said at the event, explaining to the crowd that he understands both sides of the issue. “This is about doing the right thing and finding the right politicians who are willing to do the right thing more than they’re afraid of losing their jobs.”
‘Doing the right thing’
After that first speech, Barnard said he transformed from someone who had never before read the text of a law to collecting signatures and traveling to Washington, D.C. to talk with Congress members. Through that evolution, his message stayed consistent: He wants lawmakers to pass laws that keep people safe. 
Barnard was also a strong supporter of the red flag referendum that Maine voters approved in November. His story was even featured in a campaign video. When he was out collecting signatures, Barnard said he often asked people if they would like to help with mental health and gun safety. As he sees it, the Lewiston shooting “was a mental health issue all day long.”
Maine voters opt for red flag law, expanding options for confiscating a firearm

That’s why to him a red flag law makes sense. Robert Card II, the perpetrator of the Lewiston shooting, needed mental health support and although his family sought help for him, they weren’t successful in getting it. Barnard said he considers Card a victim, too, because of his ultimate death by suicide. Had the red flag law been in place, Card’s family could have gone directly to a judge to have his firearms confiscated.
Barnard’s work volunteering for the red flag campaign and his other advocacy over the past two years culminated last week when he was recognized by the Maine Gun Safety Coalition.
Executive Director Nacole Palmer said that when she thinks of Barnard, she thinks of Atlas, the character from Greek mythology who holds the world on his shoulders. She called him “the hero of our movement.”
“His willingness to share his story so that others can be spared from having to endure that most painful loss is extraordinary,” she said. 
While Palmer was happy to recognize him publicly and tell the couple hundred people who were at the ceremony last Thursday in Portland about all the good Barnard has done, she said any award pales in comparison to the energy and passion he’s put in.
But if you ask Barnard, he said he’s just “doing the right thing.” Telling his story takes him back to those painful moments, but he also speaks up because he believes that Lewiston was an avoidable tragedy. 
Advocating beyond Maine’s borders
Although the red flag law passed, Barnard said his work is “far, far” from over. He wants his advocacy to stretch beyond the state’s boundaries to see laws passed that keep families across the country from experiencing what he has.
People, he said, need to be responsible for their guns. One of his proposals is to create a transfer of ownership document, similar to a vehicle title, that people would fill out when selling or purchasing guns.
He explained that it wouldn’t be a government registry, which many Second Amendment advocates oppose. Rather, he said it would increase accountability for who is buying and selling guns and could be helpful for police tracing weapons used in crimes. 
Palmer isn’t surprised Barnard wants to take his efforts beyond Maine and said she looks forward to continuing to work by his side.
“I do feel that Arthur has and continues to honor his son through all of his advocacy, and I hope that he feels good about all that he has contributed,” she said.

That includes “Iryna’s Law”, a Republican-led measure that limits pretrial release options for those accused of violent crimes, ramps up scrutiny of court magistrates and attempts to jumpstart the state’s death penalty process.
State lawmakers passed the bill earlier this year after Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman, was killed on public transit in Charlotte. That killing sparked national headlines and drew the attention of the White House. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has called the new law a “first step to ensure what happened to her never happens again.”
Gov. Josh Stein signed the bill into law in October, praising its changes to pretrial release but calling its attempt to expedite the death penalty process “barbaric.” He also called for the General Assembly to further invest in mental health treatment.
The law requires secured bond or GPS-monitored house arrest for defendants accused of “violent offenses,” as lawmakers aim to prevent magistrates from releasing repeat offenders before trial. And court magistrates who oversee those hearings are now subject to suspension by state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Newby.
“Iryna’s Law” also aims to streamline aspects of the death penalty and open the possibility of resuming executions.
Lethal injection remains the state’s default method of execution, but has been on pause for almost two decades amid continued legal and regulatory challenges. Under the new law, if a court finds the method to be unconstitutional, the state would be required to adopt another method. That could include the electric chair or firing squad.
Stein has said “there will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor.”
‘Public Safety Act’ creates new felonies, ramps up severity of other penalties
Another criminal justice law will also take effect Dec. 1, creating new criminal penalties and increasing the punishment for existing penalties. It also makes changes to post-conviction court motions, the release of firearms to defendants and out-of-state domestic violence orders.
The “Public Safety Act of 2025” also:

Creates new felony charges for exposing a child under 16 years old to a controlled substance.
Makes all instances of solicitation of minors by computer into more severe felonies.
Allows an out-of-state resident to pursue a protective order against another person for acts that have occurred within the state.
Creates the felony crime of “habitual domestic violence” if a person has repeated convictions of domestic violence. The new felony is a more severe violation than the defendant’s most recent violation.
Increases severity of felonies for possession and sale of fentanyl and carfentanil.
Requires defendants to file motions for relief after conviction within seven years of one of the events that led to that conviction.
Allows a sheriff to release surrendered firearms to a defendant without a court order if the defendant is not otherwise barred from having them. The sheriff must conduct a criminal history check before doing so.

Other North Carolina laws taking effect Dec. 1
More new criminal penalties: Creates a variety of new criminal penalties, including the unlawful sale and possession of embalming fluid and larceny of gift cards. Also increases punishments for other offenses, including larceny of mail and assaulting a utility or communications worker.
Online sexual exploitation: Requires online sites to establish procedures to remove pornographic images upon request. Allows the attorney general to pursue action against users or site operators who violate the law. Also requires the state registrar to maintain copies of previous birth certificates when a person requests to have their sex changed on their certificate.
(A separate, controversial section of the law, which defines “biological sex” and “male” and “female” among other terms, takes effect Jan. 1.) The law was vetoed by Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Auditor investigations: Allows the state auditor to audit or investigate any entity that receives state or federal dollars. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Josh Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Nondiscrimination in disaster recovery: Makes it a felony to discriminate based on political affiliation while providing disaster recovery assistance. The law was spurred by a report of a FEMA supervisor in Florida instructing workers to avoid homes with Trump flags or signs after Hurricane Milton.
Squatter removal: Allows property owners to pursue an expedited process to remove squatters.
Tinted windows: Removes window tinting from state safety inspection requirements. Drivers with tinted windows must roll down the window when a law enforcement officer approaches.
Nonprofit records disclosure: Bars public agencies from collecting or releasing unnecessary information about 501(c) nonprofit organizations’ donors, members or volunteers. It was vetoed by Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Continuing care retirement communities: Makes a number of changes to licensure, certification and other regulations for continuing care retirement communities.

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)Days before Thanksgiving, volunteers at the Dream Center in Bismarck were busy prepping 40 turkeys for a holiday meal. 
Last year, the meal ministry served 500 Thanksgiving meals. This year, founder and executive director Jim Barnhardt anticipates more than 600 people will walk in for a sit-down dinner.
“We try to make food access very easy for people,” he said. “We see a lot of younger families and seniors who are trying to stretch their budgets. This is one way we can help.”
Communities across the state are seeing a growing need for food assistance this holiday season. 
Reasons for the increased need vary, according to community and faith leaders who are finding ways to address food insecurity. Some families and individuals are catching up financially after the federal government shutdown postponed federal food assistance payments in November. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget. 
North Dakota sends out SNAP money but effects of delay remain 

Others are challenged by the growing cost of groceries.
Still others are stressed by the need to prepare for this time of year. Colder weather means the cost of winter coats and heating bills. Christmas means gifts and more celebrations. 
It’s one reason the Dream Center will keep its food pantry open on Thanksgiving while the turkey dinner is being served. 
“We know going into the holiday season, a lot of people are trying to catch up and save money to buy some of the other things they need,” Barnhardt said. “A free meal or groceries makes a difference.”
Community Action Partnership in Minot has handed out Thanksgiving baskets for several years. This year, they distributed 30 baskets filled with a turkey and a $50 gift certificate. The priority is families the partnership has helped throughout the year.
That said, the organization could’ve handed out to more families but was limited by funding, said Willy Soderholm, executive director.
“We’re seeing more and more requests,” he said. “Over the last year or so, I’ve noticed a lot more need for food assistance. Food is expensive.”
In Fargo, Calvary United Methodist is one of several churches offering Thanksgiving meals and baskets for the holiday. Church leadership reached out to Fargo and West Fargo schools to identify families who might benefit. 
Calvary planned for 250 meals and opened registration on Nov. 3. 
By noon, all the meals were claimed and the church decided to offer an additional 50 meals.
“There’s a big need out there in the community,” said the Rev. Rey Colón, Calvary’s senior pastor. “We felt bad that we had to turn people away. Next year, we think we’ll double the amount.”
He and his staff think the government shutdown this fall drove people to sign up for a holiday meal. When registration opened in early November, the fate of SNAP benefits were uncertain. But even once federal food assistance was issued, the need for food remained.
“If you have a family of five, you might spend half of your food assistance for the month on one (Thanksgiving) meal,” he said. “It’s hard to justify that.”

When Red River United Indivisible became aware that federal food assistance could be frozen, its members decided to host community meals every Saturday in November. One week volunteers served hotdishes and desserts to anyone who came to the basement of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Moorhead, Minnesota. 
Leftovers were packaged and distributed in downtown Fargo.
“We recognize that the price of groceries is going up and that SNAP benefits are no longer certain,” said Lyn Docter-Pinnick. “Families are struggling and a warm meal can make a difference.”
In Grand Forks, the Northlands Rescue Mission is preparing to deliver over 2,000 meals on Thanksgiving morning. Cooking started the weekend before and 25 volunteers were expected to deliver the meals to those who signed up until the day before Thanksgiving.
The fully cooked meals include turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberries, buns, a vegetable and pie.
“It’s all hands on deck,” said Elaina Wickman, interim director at the mission.  “Most of our staff volunteers on Thanksgiving. My whole family is involved. It’s quite a process.”
The mission typically distributes 60 food boxes every Tuesday and Friday to people who are food insecure, Wickman said. On the first Tuesday in November after food stamps were suspended, staff handed out over 100 food boxes – a record for the organization.
Federal food assistance has returned, but Wickman observes that people are worried.
“They don’t know what might happen in the future, so I’m seeing more people making decisions ‘just in case,’” she said.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621. Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-Gen. Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November. It became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail.
The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led.
Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious.
Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political.
The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws.
Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated.
This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and, of course, the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all.
Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Photo: Getty Images) Governor Josh Stein and the NC Department of Commerce last week celebrated seven new economic development projects, bringing the total number of new jobs created in North Carolina this year to nearly 33,000. But the thirst to attract more jobs to the state also brings new pressures on North Carolina’s water infrastructure.
A study released this month by the NC Chamber Foundation finds the state’s future growth may very well depend on how well the state can balance aging infrastructure, supply reliability, and uncertain funding over the long-term.
Agriculture is the state’s largest industry, but water usage data is not consistently collected. (Photo: Getty Images)
The report notes that North Carolina has more than 5,800 public water systems, including nearly 2,000 community water systems and over 3,600 wastewater systems. The systems are aging and in many cases are “financially fragile.” In rural communities, the problems are especially vexing because they can’t generate additional revenue due to the small customer base. According to the report, nearly one-third of North Carolina’s community water systems serve 100 or fewer customers, with limited resources available for maintenance.
A 2024 survey of water utilities conducted by the University of North Carolina School of Government and released this summer found that over half of the respondents (56.3%) said that their system does not engage in long-term supply or demand forecasting.
Another challenge highlighted by the chamber foundation’s report is the inconsistent data available on our water supply. The report points out that agricultural water users that withdraw one million or more gallons of water a day, and non-agricultural water users that withdraw 100,000 or more gallons of water a day, must report on their water usage annually to the Department of Environmental Quality. But agricultural withdrawals of less than one million gallons per day are not required to be reported. That data is collected through a voluntary survey.
Theresa Landewe, director and principal scientist for Intera (Screengrab from NC Chamber webinar)
Theresa Landewe, director and principal scientist for Intera, which conducted the analysis for the chamber, believes accurate data helps better understand the reliability of this resource.
“We need to understand what those limitations are, and really need a whole picture of all the water uses and how those impact each other,” said Landewe during a Nov. 18 webinar on the Water Infrastructure Competitiveness Report.  “Historically, we have all these small utilities, and they didn’t run into each other. They didn’t impact each other. Now with growth, everything has implications for our neighbors.”
 An aging workforce
In addition to data, the report highlights the need for more water system workers.
Roughly one-third of the national water-sector workforce will be eligible to retire within the next decade, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The report says the state can address that expected shortfall by creating new partnerships between state agencies, community colleges and professional associations to grow the next generation of operators, managers, and engineers.
“North Carolina has a great opportunity to leverage higher education in this regard,” said Jim Spangler, president of Spangler Environmental, an environmental consulting firm. “That pipeline of talent needs to be a priority for economic development success in this state.”
A key ingredient to growth
When Amgen announced it would expand its manufacturing operation in Holly Springs and invest $1 billion in Wake County, the biotech company had to be certain that it would have the water it needed now and in the future.

“Water isn’t just a utility for us, it’s an ingredient. It’s how we manufacture products for patients all across the globe,” said Dana Martinez, the head of corporate affairs for Amgen North Carolina.
“Water reliability and quality are essential from day one. Our bio-manufacturing depends on the consistent high purity availability from our municipal partners,” said Martinez. “It’s important that we have confidence that the systems can grow with us as we grow.”
Martinez said Amgen worked closely with local municipalities and the state Department of Environmental Quality early in the planning process to understand infrastructure, timelines and redundancy options.
“It’s important that we have a clear understanding of not just the current capacity, but the future expansion plans as well,” said Martinez.

Beyond industrial water use, residential water use can have a big impact on supply. Raleigh Water serves approximately 650,000 residents not only in Raleigh, but the surrounding towns of Garner, Wake Forest, Rolesville, Knightdale, Wendell and Zebulon.
And while many take safe, clean drinking water for granted, conservation remains critical. A leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons of water per day. The average shower uses five gallons of water per minute, based on Raleigh’s water usage calculator. And if you hand-wash your dishes with the water running, you use about three gallons of water per minute. Add it all together and the average North Carolinian uses between 50 and 75 gallons of water daily.
According to estimates from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the state requires over $10 billion to address drinking water infrastructure needs.

(Getty Images)Foodborne illnesses involving raw milk exposure have increased after West Virginia legalized direct-to-consumer sales, according to information from the state Department of Health. 
Consuming raw or unpasteurized milk, which can be a health risk, has been legal in West Virginia since 2016 through herd shares, which allows people to pay a monthly fee to buy a share of a dairy herd and get a portion of the milk produced. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed House Bill 4911, which allows the direct sale of raw milk. 
According to the state Department of Health, between 2014 and 2023, West Virginia averaged about four foodborne illnesses per year among people who reported raw dairy as an exposure.  Between 2016 and 2024, the state investigated a single suspected outbreak involving raw milk. 
Since House Bill 4911 became law in June 2024, the state has had 12 foodborne illnesses where raw milk has been reported to have been an exposure, the state health department said. In the same time frame, the state has not investigated any outbreaks involving raw milk.
The illnesses reported include five cases of Campylobacteriosis, which causes diarrhea and spreads to people from animals, including cows; four cases of salmonella, a bacteria that causes diarrhea, fever and stomach pains; two cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or STEC, an illness that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, and can lead to kidney failure; and one case of Giardiasis, an illness caused by a parasite that causes stomach cramps, bloating, upset stomach and loose stools.
“Consuming raw milk can lead to serious health risks, especially for certain vulnerable populations,” Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications for the state Office of Shared Administration, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “Raw milk that has not been pasteurized can be a source of a foodborne illness. While good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful bacteria.”
According to the health department, consuming saw milk was a potential risk factor for transmitting the bacteria, but other contributing factors may have been involved, so the state cannot confirm that the raw milk caused the illnesses. 
The bill legalizing direct raw milk sales had wide support from Republicans in both the state House of Delegates and the Senate during the regular legislative session last year. Then-Gov. Jim Justice allowed the bill to become law without signing it. 
The law requires that containers of raw milk be clearly labeled as “unpasteurized raw milk”, and include the name and physical address of the seller, the date of production, and a warning that consuming raw milk may increase risk of foodborne illness. Rules from the state Department of Agriculture require the milk be stored in a system or device that maintains a temperature of 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit until the exchange of sale. Any complaints of adulterated milk received by the Department of Agriculture are to be referred on to the state Department of Health. 
Beth Southern, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture, said the department has not received any reports of illnesses associated with raw milk sales. The department does not keep track of who sells raw milk or where, she said. 
Marie Krause, an associate professor in West Virginia University’s School of Agriculture and Food Systems, said it’s difficult to tell if the increase in foodborne illnesses is alarming without knowing how much raw milk was sold in the state in that time frame. She repeated the Department of Health’s point that the cases involved raw milk but may not have been caused by the raw milk. 
“Also, since there were no outbreaks linked to raw milk consumption, it means that no more than one person who consumed raw milk became ill at that time,” she wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)Groups have begun offering support or a rebuttal to the West Virginia Board of Education as they’ve asked the state’s highest court whether lawmakers have the authority to approve or reject education rules approved by the state board.
A Republican-led bill, passed earlier this year in West Virginia, gave lawmakers the ultimate authority over school board policies. It became law in April without the governor’s signature, and lawmakers behind the measure assumed it would trigger a lawsuit.
While state agencies submit rule changes to the Legislature for review, the state school board previously had autonomy to determine education policies. The West Virginia Constitution says, “The general supervision of the free schools of the State shall be vested in the West Virginia board of education which shall perform such duties as may be prescribed by law.”
House Bill 2755 requires that all legislative rules enacted by the board must first be authorized by the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability. Next, proposed rules would then be submitted to the full Legislature for review to determine adoption, rejection or possible changes. 
Three years ago, West Virginia voters rejected a similar proposal giving lawmakers the power in education. 
The state school board has challenged the legislation, filing a lawsuit that asks the state Supreme Court to determine whether lawmakers have the legal authority included in the bill.
The West Virginia Parent Teacher Association, which has more than 5,500 members in the state, submitted a brief in support of the state school board’s lawsuit, saying the legislation “would place unconstitutional limits on the board’s constitutional authority to oversee the state’s public schools and the board’s ability to make educational decisions based on the best interests of students.”
“House Bill 2755 is a hornbook example of one branch of government treading upon the constitutionally derived powers of other branches, which is an outcome of our system of checks and balances, as well as this court’s binding decisions, cannot abide,” the group wrote in the fling. 
The West Virginia PTA cited a1988 state Supreme Court decision that upheld the school board’s authority in rulemaking, saying the board has a “special standing” under the state constitution. The group said the ruling means the legislation passed this year “is void” and called on the state Supreme Court to declare the bill unconstitutional. 
The West Virginia Association of School Administrators and the West Virginia School Board Association also filed a joint brief in support of the school board.
“County superintendents, boards of education, and administrators all rely on the State [Board of Education] as the education expert to quickly and effectively implement policies to govern both the day-to-day and systemic operations,” they wrote. 
“The State [Board of Education] directs the functioning of the county boards. For example, when the State [Board of Education] issues state-wide standards, it is the job of the county to carry out those standards,” the filing continued. “Imposing legislative whims into the rulemaking process would upend the current process and remove constitutionally-granted authority from the hands of education experts.”
The Cardinal Institute, a conservative nonprofit focused on education policy, sided with the Legislature, saying the 1988 Supreme Court ruling should be overturned.
Their filing said the highest court’s ruling “infringes on the power” of the Legislature, and that the state school board should not be immune from legislative oversight and power. 
“As a part of the executive department, the Board of Education must be subject to the checks and balances of other departments,” the Cardinal Institute wrote in their filing. “The legislature has, by general law, provided a system of free schools throughout the state. But it will be noted that it is not prohibited from augmenting, and making more efficient, the general system of free schools.”
Lawmakers behind the bill said they wanted more accountability on the state’s struggling school system. 
In July, the board announced that it was planning to sue Secretary of State Kris Warner after it unanimously approved a new rule that dealt with design equipment standards for school buses. It was first approved by the state board on May 14 and put out for a 30-day public comment period.
The Secretary of State’s Office said it was obligated to reject that filing because of the newly passed law.

The greatest accomplishment is not in never falling, but in rising again after you fall.

CEDAR RAPIDS — College and pro football teams have had a trick play called the Fumblerooski. The Kinney family invented a play I call the “Mom-arooski.”
It happened at a backyard Thanksgiving Day touch football game in my sister’s backyard in Cedar Rapids 24 years ago.
We were playing “boys vs. girls.” Of course, we boys thought we had the upper hand.
Nope. Dumb as a box of rocks.
On the girls’ opening play, Mom, who was celebrating her 79th birthday that day, crumpled to the ground upon the snap of the ball. We boys all rushed to Mom’s aid, fearing a twisted ankle or worse.
While we were all gathered around Mom, my sister handed off to my daughter Hannah, who was 9 then, and the little sweetie gleefully ran for a touchdown!
Mom was fine. My sister had dialed up a masterpiece, perfectly executed by Mom and Hannah.
I can hear deep-voiced John Facenda, narrator of NFL Films: “A play as devastatingly effective as a Jerry Kramer block on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field.”
That’s one of my happiest Thanksgiving memories. May you cherish yours and hopefully make some new ones.
Happy Thanksgiving.

In the open hatch of a truck parked close to the entrance, I see a little face, eyes wide and tearful, peaking out beneath thick blankets. 
I say hello and ask him if he is alone, yes, if he is scared, yes, if he wants to come inside, yes. He puts on a thick Spiderman poncho, and I carry him in. 
The spirited employee who is there every morning lets us come behind the check-in counter. I sit the boy down on a tall chair and take a seat next to him. She calls the police. I realize what is about to happen and warn the boy, the police are going to come, they are going to ask you questions, you are not in trouble, it’s OK to be afraid, it’s OK to ask for help, OK? His eyes are big as he glances toward the door.  
While we wait, I ask him questions: his name, his Halloween costume, his favorite trick-or-treat candy. Where is your mother? Are you hungry? The Y employee pulls a Goldfish snack bag from her own lunch when he says he likes cheese and crackers. 
He tells me his mother is in jail, and it reminds me of stories I’ve heard about the disparate sentencing for women here and how Idaho has the highest incarceration rate of women in the United States, by a lot.  
The police arrive, and they ask the boy questions; he doesn’t answer them but after they turn away he asks me where their guns are. I have trouble understanding him so he makes the signal for a gun with his pointer finger and thumb and points to their belts. 
Five EMTs arrive, all, it seems, sporting mustaches, to check for cold exposure. They are friendly, are able to get a couple answers out of him and leave without any concerns. 
Dad comes out and looks shocked but sober and calm. I can hear some of the questions the officers are asking: Where do you work? What were you thinking? Where do you park your car to sleep? It’s illegal to sleep in your car in Idaho in cities with populations over 100,000 so I gather they are building their case. 
The father says he is employed in the trades, an essential profession, and that his son goes to day care. I hear him tell the officer that he thought if his son woke up and got afraid he could just come inside. It’s a big miscalculation, born more from a lack of understanding of the socio-emotional needs of a child that age than from some intentional harm or simple neglect. 
The boy says he wants to go to his dad so we let him down from the tall chair and he gives his dad a big punch in the leg, as if to say, how dare you leave me. I say hello to the dad and goodbye to the boy and try to get some exercise before work, but I am quickly called back to the front desk to give a statement. 
The officer, a new one, asks me some basic questions. I repeat the story. She layers my answers with her own judgments, judgements I wouldn’t apply in this situation. 
Any questions for me, she asks. I ask if they are connecting the father with services. Oh we will connect him with services; he’ll be hearing from Heath and Welfare, she says in a lofty tone. 
The process is a total scene, so public, and so shameful. If I were that father, I’d find it hard to show my face there again. I myself have trouble returning the next day. 
Visceral memories of my own single mother, our houseless struggles, being left alone, terrified, and finally, the loss of her, all come flooding back. 
I have no recourse. I have no way of knowing what happened next, no way of offering the support I know he needs and that I would freely give. I am prevented from caring any further by a system that steps in instead. I am forced to walk away and encouraged to forget. 
But I cannot forget. 
We cannot forget that child’s face, not in the richest country in the world, while our government wastes money on ballrooms and bailouts, parties and private jets. Not while they rig it so the rich get richer while that little boy sleeps in the back of a truck with his mother in jail. I will never forget that father’s face, holding his son’s hand while the whole world bears down.

My father and mother were born in the 1920’s, grew up during the Depression and World War II, and November and December were not very different for them than the other 10 months of the year. Thanksgiving and Christmas days were quiet and simple. 
But not for their children: It was important to my parents to create memories for us and their grandchildren and what better way to do that than to start the holiday season with an unforgettable Thanksgiving lunch.  Food was always a big part of any special occasion that involved my   m demothe
My husband Larry’s first Thanksgiving meal as an official part of my family came in 1992. My family —  the Terrys — were East Tennessee Lincoln Republicans.  Even though he is a yellow dog Democrat, Larry had been warmly accepted by my family — or so he thought. 
Mother always started her Christmas decorating the day after Halloween. Every wall, staircase, table and corner in her home was covered with Christmas decorations and they stayed up at least until Jan. 2.  Starting at Thanksgiving, my sisters and I were expected to wear our best holiday motif sweaters and style our hair for the family pictures that would surely be taken.
Mother set the time that we would eat and on Thanksgiving morning, as soon as we arrived, we went to work. My daddy had an annual ritual of telling my sisters and me that it might be Mother’s last holiday season because she worked too hard. Then Daddy would worry which of his four daughters and their families were going to be late and whether the time of our arrival would impact the time we ate.



				My mother, a Republican, professed to like my new husband, a Democrat. But the food she served him made us all question her intentions.			


My sisters and I knew exactly what was involved in Mother’s “memory creating holiday” meal. My mother inherited her mother’s table and normally my parents had enough room around it for four to six people. But not for family gatherings! There were several heavy big wooden leaves that had to be installed to seat up to 20 people and the leaves had to be locked in to avoid accidents.  Our husbands offered to help, which we accepted for only the heavy lifting, and we had to collect chairs from all over the house and make sure they were sturdy. A chair collapsing during a big meal was funny but could be unhealthy. We then asked the men to leave so the sisters could privately share our news — or call it gossip if you must. 
The tablecloth had to hang correctly and at one time Mother’s table looked like something out of “Downton Abby” with her best china, polished sterling silver and cloth napkins. 
When it was just the two of them, Mother rarely cooked for Daddy. There was a friendly meat-and-three restaurant in their neighborhood, and eating there at least once a day —not necessarily together  —was a way for Daddy and Mother to socialize with the community and keep up with what was going on. 
This informal eatery had a catering service, and Mother decided to order her Thanksgiving meal from them. She picked up her order and put the containers of food in the trunk of her car, drove the short distance home and brought the food into her kitchen. She got up early on Thanksgiving morning to warm the food and to transfer most of it to her dishes. 
My husband, Larry Woods, was already a vegetarian when we married, and this caused much angst in our family. They thought he would starve without meat and that it would be okay to serve vegetables that had been cooked with pork, chicken or beef.  I suggested Mother add a dish of macaroni and cheese for Larry because what could go wrong?  Everyone loves macaroni and cheese. 
When we finally sat down to eat Daddy always said a few words before offering grace. Mother, in turn, always worried the food was getting cold while Daddy was praising Mother for her efforts and the Lord for our bounty. We kept our heads bowed and sometimes glanced and smiled at each other wondering how long this would go on before we could finally eat. 
Passing all the food was a production. which according to Mother — and manners expert Emily Post — was to the right. We all talked at the same time and tried not to drop the heavy serving pieces as we passed around the food. We had been raised to put a small portion of every dish on our plate, which did not apply to the vegetarian at the table. 
As we ate, I noticed the mac and cheese had a strange taste to it and that Larry was stirring and playing with his mac and cheese instead of eating it and served himself a mound of bread each time the silver breadbasket was passed. 
Finally, we cleared the table and began preparing dessert. When my sisters and I were alone in the kitchen, I asked them if they noticed anything weird about the mac and cheese, and they all said it tasted terrible. One of us asked Mother if she had tasted it. She reminded us that she did not care for mac and cheese but there could have been a problem with the kerosene she kept in her car spilling in her trunk and “just perhaps” some of that kerosene spilled onto the mac and cheese. Mother said she was not going to throw away good money spent on food just because of a little kerosene. We did not know whether to laugh hysterically or be horrified. 
The next day Larry was on “The Roundtable,” a Nashville talk radio program that featured politicos discussing current events. Live and on the air, he said that his new mother-in-law had tried to kill him at his first Thanksgiving meal because his candidate, and not hers, had just won the 1992 Presidential election. Mother was listening, she called me immediately and said to tell Larry she was going to kill him and just tell God he died. 
The mac and cheese with kerosene became part of our family history. Vegetarian dishes are always viewed with suspicion, especially during an election year, and we still do not know why the kerosene was in Mother’s trunk, but Larry took great joy for many years by sharing the story of how his mother-in-law tried to kill him that Thanksgiving Day.

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)Returning to a now very familiar restaurant a few blocks from where I live in New York City for brunch a few days ago, I met the new hostess who, much to my surprise, is a poet, who has performed at the Guggenheim. Then again, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising since creatives seem to find one another. Her name is even poetic, Alondra. 
What unfolded over the course of enjoying my blueberry, silver-dollar pancakes provided nourishment for my soul, my spirit. We talked about our journey to becoming a creative and about poets whose work we respect for the truths they bring out of the shadows and into the light: Silas House, Ocean Vuong, Callie Siskel and in my mind always Mary Oliver and Billy Collins. I mentioned that I would gladly yield to her to explain in further detail to me Vuong’s core message. And since I frequent this restaurant often, I welcome what future conversations will gift to broaden my horizons on the work of such an acclaimed author. Up to this point, the conversation was enlightening and energizing. But what followed far surpassed an appreciation of poetry.
I was asked (as I often am in New York City) about the Appalachian region in general and West Virginia in particular. The conversation almost always turns to one of their misunderstanding of the struggles faced by those in rural America and a fierce pride deeply rooted in those who dwell in that culture. They want to know how West Virginians moved from a historically blue state to an overwhelming red state. Conversation turns to the coal industry and geographical challenges and the opioid epidemic. Each is a revealing detour from the enjoyment of blueberry pancakes and crisp bacon. And I welcome it at every turn.
But it wasn’t until Alondra said, “We are living in fascinating times,” that I stopped eating and wondered at the certainty and near enthusiasm with which she delivered these words. I looked at her and asked what she meant. She explained with such conviction that in times of unrest, uncertainty, creatives find ways to hone their craft to an even greater degree; they are fed by the challenge to put the turmoil, the spectacle in perspective and create work that speaks not only to the unrest but to the possibilities that we, as creatives, can bring to the table to possibly, hopefully, right the wrongs that plague us. I was not only grateful for her vision, but reminded also of how very important it is for each of us to be more open than ever to finding ways out of a most intricate and dangerous maze.
This moment — this most refreshing moment — reminded me of a note I received from a reader of one of my recent op-eds, who while supporting my opinion reminded me that what is happening throughout West Virginia is also happening all across the country. And with the reduction and even the elimination of arts and culture both nationally and throughout West Virginia, Alondra reminded me that more than ever we must not loosen our firm hold on what creatives bring to the table, for it has been shown throughout history what happens when those voices are threatened, in some cases silenced; they grow even stronger. My message to those who are coming far too close in their attempts to silence those certain, creative voices: Be careful. Be very careful.

(Getty Images)More than half a million hunters are expected to take to the fields and woods for Pennsylvania’s firearm deer hunting season that begins on Saturday, Nov. 29 this year. 
The season will last through Dec. 13, with hunting allowed on two Sundays – Nov. 30 and Dec. 7.

“Opening day of deer season here touches countless families, mine included, as well as offices, work sites and schools,” said State Game Commission Executive Director Steve Smith. “It’s about more than recreation, though. Deer season is also conservation and compassion turned into action, as our hunters keep deer in balance with their habitat, while feeding themselves and hungry neighbors. There’s truly nothing like it.”
Last year, an estimated 476,880 deer were harvested by hunters in Pennsylvania, with an estimated 283,760 during firearm season.
Nearly 284,000 pounds of venison were donated through the Hunters Sharing the Harvest program at more than 100 licensed butcher shops in 56 counties. It was then distributed to food banks across the state. Some 1.1 million servings of venison were ultimately delivered.
According to the Game Commission, during rifle deer hunting season, Pennsylvanians are allowed one antlered deer per hunting license, and one antlerless deer per Wildlife Management Unity (WMU) specific antlerless license, Deer Management Assistance Program (DMAP) permit or Agricultural Deer Control Permit.
Hunters must wear 250 inches of fluorescent orange material on their head, chest and back, visible 360 degrees around them, and can shoot between a half hour before sunrise and a half hour after sundown.
This year marks the first firearm deer hunting season since legislation allowing hunting on Sundays was passed in Pennsylvania. Thirteen Sundays were selected throughout the year, with two, during rifle deer season.
However, hunting will not be allowed in Pennsylvania state parks on Dec. 7, though it is permitted on state game lands, state forests and private lands where hunters have permission.
Licenses cost $20.97 for adult Pennsylvanians  and $101,97 for nonresidents. 
Antler restrictions vary by WMU. Details about antler restrictions statewide and reporting harvests can be found on the game commission’s website.
Hunters are required to fill out harvest tags that come with their licenses and attach them to the ear of each deer. Deer harvests must be reported to the Game Commission within 10 days, which can be done online at huntfish.pa.gov or by calling 800-838-4431.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 05:57:09.395674

Then on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the U-Haul delivers the donations to the State House lawn for the annual Buy Nothing Day Coat Exchange. Coats, hats, gloves, scarves and socks are given away for free to anyone who needs them — often unhoused people, refugees and low-income families.
“People need a leg up and this is their first way to do that,” Testoni said in an interview. “It literally keeps people alive in the winter to have a coat.”
This year’s exchange will be held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 28, outside the State House, on the lawn facing the Providence Place mall.
The annual Black Friday tradition dates back to 1997 when local activist Greg Gerritt and some friends wanted to highlight the problems with consumerism while also doing something useful for the community, Testoni said.
It’s part of the reason the event has been held on the State House lawn, which lies directly across the street from Providence Place where shoppers are looking for holiday deals.

“It’s absolutely there to make a statement,” Testoni said. “We have to be prepared for anything to happen. We have to be prepared to help each other. We have to be prepared to stand together as a community.”
Volunteers send out the initial call for donations on Labor Day weekend before setting up collection locations. 
When she stopped at CARJON Air Conditioning and Heating in Smithfield late Tuesday afternoon, Testoni collected 567 coats — the largest single-site donation she’s picked up in her 15 years helping with the exchange.
“We’ve been busy elves,” Chris Collette, CARJON’s sales team manager, said. “We were happy to get a decent amount to be able to help people.”
Collette said he and coworkers felt it was especially important to collect winter gear this year amid the recent pause in federal food benefits.
Testoni doesn’t have any firm number on how many items get distributed at the annual coat exchange. She said she just knows that it’s in the hundreds. Which leaves plenty of leftover coats, which she said are then given to the Mathewson Street United Methodist Church in Providence where they can be distributed to people in need..
While rewarding, Testoni said it’s challenging to constantly see hundreds of people line up for a coat.
“I hate that we have to do it, but I’m glad there are people who step up,” she said. “We’ve never gone without coats.”
Testoni has acknowledged recent state investments in trying to keep Rhode Islanders warm this coming winter. In late October, Gov. Dan McKee’s administration committed over $1.7 million in grants to municipalities and nonprofit service providers to expand Rhode Island’s network of warming centers and homeless shelters.
But as long as the need continues to keep Rhode Islanders warm, Testoni said organizers will continue to distribute coats.
“With a simple twist of fate or loss of a job, any one of us can be standing there waiting for a coat,” she said.

This column was first published Nov. 27, 2024.
Frankfort’s small army of state workers, fresh from four days off for Thanksgiving on Dec. 1, 1997, slipped from their cars in normal morning sun and almost as one looked to the sky with twisted, stricken faces.
The Capitol Annex parking lot seemed misted with some indelible flesh-rot that despised humankind. It wasn’t just a smell but a Presence. It sucked life from you; your soul departed and you knew it would not return. Your eyes glazed toward opaque. You could not breathe but for shallow, burning gasps that presaged death rattle.
Of all possible causes, you wouldn’t at this moment imagine a turkey.
Yet. Over there, 30 feet yonder, a maintenance lad in a white haz-mat suit with a stout black bag and a muscular garbage picker crept toward a thing on the Annex lawn. It looked like a yellowed stew of plastic and flesh. It seemed to glow and quiver. Some brave parking-lot sufferer managed to croak out toward the creeping lad, “Dear God, son … What … Why?”
“Some a-hole threw a turkey on the lawn,” the lad said, in a voice that echoed death. It was a sentence as final and direct as, “They launched the nuclear missiles.”
When he’d kissed his wife goodbye that morning, the young man had no clue what this day would bring. He was about to be a hero. He retrieved the turkey. He lost his sense of smell. “Like starin’ at the Sun and goin’ blind,” he told the Workers Comp Board weeks later, I heard. It was a metaphor nailed down tight.
So this is a story I’ve been badgered to tell since then. It started when Rep. Jim Callahan of Southgate gave me a Thanksgiving turkey.
Jim was House Democratic Caucus chairman. In the happy event he liked you, you could have no finer friend in the stinging spin-drift of the Kentucky legislature. If he didn’t, he was one of the few people who could and would get you fired. A man to be trusted and feared. A perfect politician.
I had just lately and reluctantly been put in charge of the Legislative Research Commission’s Public Information Office, a communications shop whose future was in doubt because of some early Republican restiveness. They didn’t find the office deferential enough. It likely wasn’t.
I made it my strategic purpose in life to become indispensable to Jim, so he (and the House Dems, then lazy with a comfortable majority) would protect me against the new restive Republican hordes. I succeeded with Jim, the caucus obeyed his instructions re: me, and in late 1997 Jim started rewarding me for my many good works with appreciated tokens like holiday meats.
The day before this particular Thanksgiving — five days before the maintenance lad’s heroics — Jim’s lanky assistant presented me with my first turkey, laid the sweaty sucker on my desk, bagged in plastic, pristine, frozen and promptly forgotten.
Forgotten, that is to say, in my windowless, steam-heated office, 80 degrees at least, with four black holidays awaiting it and a billion turkey-flesh bacteria awakening to yawn, scratch themselves, and eat.
Flash forward: 9:27 p.m., Payton Residence, Louisville. Sat. Nov. 29.
Quick scene:
“Aw, MAN! NO!”
“What?”
“I forgot the damn TURKEY!”
“What turkey?”
“The one Jim C. gave me three days ago that’s sitting on my desk like a bomb about to explode, if it hasn’t already! I have to get it.’
(Indistinct squabbling).
Even quicker scene:
“You’re not driving a hundred miles round-trip to Frankfort in the dead of night to retrieve a turkey that’s wrapped in plastic and perfectly fine. No.”
Note to young husbands: There are many days coming in your marriage when you simply look at your wife’s slant eyes and surrender. I surrendered. Fifty miles east, the turkey-flesh bacteria ate and ate.
The rest of the weekend was like waiting for biopsy results. Monday morning I drove to work early, dreading what I’d find, hoping against hope the turkey hadn’t exploded but otherwise wanting to get things cleaned up and tended to as best I could before anyone else arrived. Pretty sure I was first in the parking lot slammed by the Presence, the living thing I’d birthed.

But hope withstood its first assault. As a Frankfort native, I was accustomed to its distilleries, specifically the smell of its distilleries burning mash. The signature smell of the Kentucky River valley. In many ways, Frankfort is a smell. It’s not necessarily a good smell; many find it rank. But all share in it. Every redneck boy, every doctor’s son, every lawyer’s daughter and governor’s privileged kid walks out on fall mornings into its egalitarian embrace. It is hillbilly Marxism: Share the stink.
So for no more than half a second I thought/hoped this stink might be mash. For the second half-second I thought, “Whew, did they throw some rotting sheep cadavers into the mash vats this morning?” Then of course I knew: Turkey. Hissing from my office. Into the Annex HVAC system. Leaking out the old building’s windows. Filling the river valley. Soon to make me the laughing stock of Frankfort. Republicans would say this proved my liberalism.
I try to be relatively accurate in memoirish accounts like this (facts are critically important until they interfere with a good laugh). So I’ll admit the next half hour is a blur that resists disinterment.
The grotesque bird was still on my desk, its plastic bag ripped open by the force of its eruption. I recall an echoey dripping sound onto the floor, a yellowish oozing slime, thick like molasses, that seemed alive itself (remember, it teemed with a billion chomping necrobiomes). It looked like some bad special-effects alien from the first season of Star Trek in 1966.
I cannot remember how I managed to scoop up the carcass itself, make some quick impossible decision about disposing of it, and rush it down the still-deserted Annex hall to the bronze entry doors, where I flung it mightily onto the front lawn and the Presence began spreading in earnest, as did its legend.
At some point the heroic haz-mat kid was called, he gave the remains their final scoop, yet the smell snaked through the Capitol campus (HVAC circulation and filters are eternal, and the river valley itself a thermal trap). Many workers went home for an extra day or two of Thanksgiving celebration. Every sentence at home began “You won’t believe…”
Me, I suffered the derision I deserved, and have at least once a year for 27 years been hectored into telling “Scott’s Turkey Story” to wildly laughing, knee-slapping audiences. I’ve hated it every time, knowing they’re not exactly laughing with me, and sworn for many years I’d “write it up” and just hand the sucker out at every such request.
So now I’ve done that. Here you are. Don’t ask again.
But.
Coda: There is more to the story, and it’s good, but it doesn’t belong to me. It belongs to a fellow Capitol staffer who worked a mysterious deskless job for people who seemed powerful. His name recalls that of a major world capital. He would “borrow” your desk without asking if he needed one. Jim Callahan gave him a turkey every year too.
This is a grand fellow, as all in politics must be, but a bit absent-minded, as most in politics are. To his credit though, and unlike me, he miraculously got his gifted bird to his car that afternoon. Threw it in the trunk. Promptly forgot it.
A week or so later, troubled by some mystery problem with the car — couldn’t quite put his finger on it, snap, snap! — he dropped it off at the repair shop.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”

Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Matt Poole / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) As families gather around the Thanksgiving table today, there is a good chance that the steaming bird at the center of the feast could have come from Virginia. The U.S. Department of Agriculture ranks the commonwealth as the sixth largest producer of turkey in the country, estimating over 15 million birds were produced in 2024.
The turkeys produced in the state are not all for holiday roasts. The growth of Americans’ turkey consumption makes it an all-year commodity through ground meat, deli slices, and other foods that have become staples of the nation’s diet. In 2023, the Virginia turkey industry is estimated to have brought in over $400 million.
“Back in my grandparents’ day, it was a holiday specialty, but now, you can enjoy turkey products year round,” said Hobey Bauhan, president of the Virginia Poultry Federation.
While the value of turkeys and the amount of production nationwide is down, Bauhan said the importance of the industry is still reflected in Virginia, evidenced by investments in plants and feed operations. He said that the federation works with lawmakers on a bipartisan basis to manage policies about protecting the environment to ensure they aren’t too restrictive for the 200 family farms in the state.
“You know, if Virginia does not maintain such a positive business climate, investment could flow through another part of the country,” Bauhan said. “That’s what we want to keep the paltry industry thriving in Virginia.”
Virginia is among states such as Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, and Pennsylvania as top producers of the bird. 
With the rise in tariffs in recent years some industries have severely struggled. The turkey industry saw a win in 2023 when U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., was part of talks to lift the significant tariffs India had placed on certain American agricultural products, such as frozen turkey. The first shipments to India came out of the Shenandoah Valley, according to Bauhan.
The turkey industry was modernized through innovation in the Shenandoah Valley in the 1920s at Virginia Tech. A.L. Dean, the head of poultry science at the time, got a letter from Charles Wampler – an extension agent in Rockingham County – about artificially raising turkeys. 
“(He) experimented with hatching turkey eggs in an incubator back in the 1920s and it just kind of gave rise to a significant industry in the Shenandoah Valley,” Bauhan said.
This led the turkey industry to operate year-round in a similar way as the chicken industry.
This year the poultry federation celebrated 100 years since its official inception. Agricultural leaders and Gov. Glenn Youngkin reflected on the rich history of the industry in the region in Rockingham County.

RICHMOND. Va – Some lawmakers hope for more guardrails to better protect Virginians amid the boom in artificial intelligence.
Legislators have started to pre-file bills for the upcoming session which starts on Jan. 14. Most so far represent Democratic legislative initiatives frequently discussed on the campaign trail.
Some of the bills that will be filed include placing limitations on what chatbots can say and banning AI from purchasing tickets, according to Dels. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, and Michelle Maldonado, D-Manassas.
Last year, legislators introduced at least 20 bills in the General Assembly that tried to define or regulate AI use and expand consumer protections. A majority failed or were vetoed.
Maldonado plans to introduce an AI bill that limits what chatbots can say to humans in therapeutic and psychotherapeutic settings. Chatbots are “primed” to make a human feel good, according to Maldonado.
However, a 16-year-old boy confided in a chatbot about his suicidal thoughts and plans. He took his own life in April, according to National Public Radio. His father testified the chatbot discouraged his son from seeking parental help.
Three out of four teenagers have used AI as consultants, according to Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that prioritizes kids’ safety.
“We have to make sure that when people are engaging with these chatbots, they are trained in such a way that they detect language that suggests self-harm, suicidal ideation, or anything like that, the responses are appropriate to go get help,” Maldonado said.
Some startup companies are trying to create chatbot companions that help people in therapy, but they cannot substitute for a human, according to Maldonado.
The second proposed bill from Maldonado will address the usage of chatbots with Virginians age 18 and under. High school and college students are heavily affected by chatbots, according to Maldonado.
“We have a gap that needs to be addressed, and regulating what kinds of uses and what kinds of guardrails we need to have in place when chatbots are interacting with minors,” Maldonado said.
Maldonado has not finalized her legislation, but she hopes there is bipartisan support for her bills.
“There will probably be some things we’ll have to work out to to make sure we garner the support we need to get it passed, but I think there is an appetite and a willingness to do it,” Maldonado said.
Maldonado introduced House Bill 2094 in the last session, which would have created requirements for developing, deploying and using high-risk AI systems. The bill also created requirements for civil penalties for noncompliance.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill, saying it was too “rigid” and would “establish a burdensome artificial intelligence regulatory framework.”
Maldonado will reintroduce the bill, but tailor it more to a specific use case and industry sector.
“I’m disappointed that he chose not to pass this bill,” Maldonado said. “This bill, a version like this that is much more comprehensive, was also carried in other states.”
Maldonado also introduced two other bills related to AI that failed in the previous General Assembly session.
Maldonado said she would like the General Assembly to take a “more aggressive position” to pass a bill that clarifies the structure around the use of social media platforms and their interaction with Virginians under the age of 18.
“The research is clear that there have been mental health harms,” Maldonado said. “That’s undeniable.”
Lawmakers will also propose a bill to require AI labels on certain types of media in an effort to slow down deepfake images and videos, according to Hayes. They may also introduce the Ban Bots Buys Act, which bans AI from purchasing tickets for events, according to Hayes.
“Those bots can be created in such a way that they buy up in bulk,” Hayes said. “They resell the tickets online and other venues, causing people to have to overpay for their purchases.”
There “definitely” needs to be guardrails around AI, according to Hayes.
“AI is already here,” Hayes said. “It is already advanced. So, for those who believe that it’s coming, they’re already way behind.”
The General Assembly passed Hayes’ bill in February which required recommendations or predictions provided by any AI-based tool to not be the sole basis for any criminal justice decisions.
 Virginians cannot be so caught up in artificial intelligence that it impacts their lives and ultimately makes decisions that could cause harm, according to Hayes.
“We want to make sure that we remain innovative, but at the same time, we want to make sure that people come first,” Hayes said.
Alan Shark, a political science associate professor at George Mason University, said he would like the General Assembly to reintroduce HB 2094.
“It really puts more pressure on the developing community to provide documentation so that if there is any kind of issue, legal challenge or otherwise, that there is documentation in a process in which they can explain,” Shark said.
Youngkin issued Executive Order 51 in July, which launched a review of statewide regulations using AI technology. An AI tool will scan state regulations and guidance documents, searching for contradictory or redundant statutes. The tool highlights areas in which the regulatory language can be streamlined.
Shark supports mandates that call for more human oversight.
“It’s just the governor prefers this to be as an executive order versus legislation,” Shark said. “On the other side, though, is a push to leverage AI for regulatory efficiency, meaning they’re looking to find ways to reduce regulation, therefore ideally encouraging more innovation.”
AI should not be political, according to Shark.
“I don’t think you can look at that by party anywhere in the country,” Shark said. “I just think it’s the level of understanding of what AI is and can do.”

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
Days of Thanksgiving
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

Photo courtesy of the Georgia Department of Natural ResourcesIt’s a bad time to be a turkey in Georgia, even if you don’t live on a poultry farm.
The number of turkey poults – what turkey experts call baby turkeys – is on the decline across nearly all of Georgia, according to numbers from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, with most of the state’s turkeys reproducing below the replacement rate of two poults per hen.
“We have been monitoring poult production in Georgia since the late 70s, and back in the 80s and 90s, we averaged about four poults per hen,” said wildlife biologist and DNR wild turkey project coordinator Emily Rushton.
The DNR’s annual count of poults per hen takes place over the summer, after the spring breeding season, when hens are with their poults. Members of the public can submit observations to help with the count.
“In the early 2000s, it took a pretty sharp decline,” Rushton said. “But the past 10 years or so, we’ve been holding steady at about 1.5 poults per hen.”
Turkeys in Georgia’s lower coastal plain in the southeastern part of the state are the sole silver lining in the poult census, with the average hen hatching 2.39 poults, up from 1.85 in last year’s survey.
The heavily populated Piedmont region which takes up most of the northern half of the state and includes Atlanta and its surrounding regions saw the steepest decline, dropping from 1.94 poults per hen last year to 1.21 this year.

The No. 1 problem facing Georgia’s gobblers is the loss of what’s called early successional habitat, which flourishes after a disturbance like a hurricane, wildfire or the removal of trees and is what exists long before land evolves into a mature forest. Think shrubby, grassy fields with dense ground cover but not a lot of trees, where turkeys can be themselves, hiding out and munching on seeds, insects and other favorites.
“There’s a lot of factors at play, certainly the most important one is probably habitat loss and landscape level changes in the state,” Rushton said. “Obviously there’s been a lot of development in Georgia, habitat fragmentation and loss of early successional habitat, which is really important for turkeys for raising their broods. The poults are relying on insects, and insects are most abundant in early successional habitat.”
Georgia has taken steps in recent years to reverse the turkeys’ downward trend, including shortening the turkey hunting season starting in 2021.
Turkey season takes place during the spring breeding season, and wildlife experts hoped pushing back the start date a week or two to let the turkeys do their thing without getting shot at would help bolster nest numbers.
“There’s some thought that perhaps the early hunting season was interrupting some of the natural calling and response in the way they behave in the woods,” said Georgia Wildlife Federation President Mike Worley. “So that’s why it was pushed back some time, to give a little bit better opportunity to allow the birds to kind of go through a natural cycle without people in the woods with them.”
Worley called the turkeys’ decline “a real concern across the state,” but he expressed optimism that the situation can be improved.
“We’ve cut the bag limit and put restrictions on how many birds hunters can take. All of those things contribute to addressing the issue,” he said. “And we’re not in a situation of absolute crisis. We’re in a situation where it demands perhaps a bit more aggressive management, and I think that’s what you’re seeing, rather than the whole nuclear option of shutting down hunting.”
Worley said one thing property owners can do to make things easier for turkeys is to plan controlled burns.
Georgia’s flora and fauna evolved to benefit from periodic fires, and burning down old vegetation can help make room for the early successional habitat where turkeys thrive.
“If somebody comes to us and says we would like to manage our land for turkeys, one of the first things that we tell them is let’s get some fire on the ground,” Worley said. “There are certainly plants that you can plant, food plots that you can put in, all kinds of things, but those are all secondary to the fact that just a simple burn – which is what our native environment really requires – a simple burn can do a lot in restoring turkey habitat.”
Rushton said it’s not just people who look forward to eating turkey, and the birds’ recovery will be important for critters up and down the food chain.
“They are a really important prey species,” she said. “Their eggs are an important prey item for a lot of wildlife species – other avian species, birds, snakes, and mammals, basically anything will eat a turkey egg or a turkey poult. And they are also a good indicator of forest health, habitat health.”

The singular ruggedness and beauty of the region is part of what draws as many as 6 million visitors to the landscape each year. But the destination also shows the effects of climate change in unique ways, and that reality is already putting pressure on regional recreation, tourism, and ways of life, said North Country scientists, business owners, and officials gathered at the foot of Mount Washington earlier this month to mark the release of the inaugural White Mountains Almanac.

 Where to find the almanac

	Four thousand copies of the first White Mountains Almanac have been printed so far, said Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray. While supplies last, physical copies of the almanac can be ordered online for free or for a suggested donation. A free e-edition is also available online.

	Rich collections of weather and climate data gathered in and around the White Mountain region can help put numbers to the changes residents and visitors have already observed, scientists said. They hope to begin sharing that data more broadly, and leverage the ability of the White Mountains to capture visitors’ hearts and minds, to help the many who enjoy the landscape adapt to the changes it faces and become more responsible stewards.
“To truly love this landscape, we must understand it,” state Tourism Director Michelle Cruz said at the event.
Long-term data provides insight
The almanac is  a free publication created through a collaboration among three North Country research institutions: the Appalachian Mountain Club, Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, and the Mount Washington Observatory. Scientists involved in the project said the text was the product of their desire to see the powerful data collected in the region reach a larger audience.
The publication contains a month-to-month description of natural phenomena local to the White Mountains, and will be distributed across the North Country. It is intended to serve as a guide for visitors to what’s happening — environmentally speaking — on the landscape at all times of year, said Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray in an interview. The text was authored by intern and science communicator Frank Vazzano. 
Its conclusions are based on expansive data collected by the three institutions about weather patterns and ecosystems in the White Mountains, Murray said. But scientists felt it wasn’t reaching enough people to have the impact it could.
“(The almanac) is really near and dear to my heart, because I’ve been thinking about this for years. … A lot of people care about the weather, but they may not really make those connections to, you know, what it means when we put all of this data together, and how our climate is changing,” Murray said.

Adapting to a changing landscape
Together, the data paint a powerful picture, Murray said, though given that the implications for the beloved landscape are murky, it’s not an easy one to share.
Among the topics covered by the almanac are a long-term increase in winter temperatures across the White Mountains; an increase in winter thaw events that can destabilize snowpack for backcountry skiers; and an overall downturn in the number of winter and summer “recreation days,” which are scored on factors like temperature and sunshine.
“It is a tough thing to feel sort of down as you realize that all these trends are going in the direction of, you know, losing the charm and the environment that we typically think of when we think about visiting the Whites,” Murray said.

Though things are changing, there are ways to adapt to these shifts and still enjoy what the White Mountains have to offer, said Mount Washington Observatory Director of Weather Operations Jay Broccolo.
That might mean timing visits better, or adjusting snowmaking operations at ski resorts to make the best use of what resources we have available, he said.
While the nature of each season is changing, the White Mountain region is still holding on to the traits that make it special, Murray said. Making visitors aware of how these phenomena are shifting over time is an important part of helping ensure they can still enjoy the things they love most about the region, she said.
“The mountains are still snowing, but when are they snowing? It’s more about change: It’s about planning and staying tuned in to what’s happening when you plan to come to the Whites,” she said.
AMC Director of Research Sarah J. Nelson echoed this idea at the Nov. 18 press event, saying that mountains like the Whites are, for many, “climate refugia,” or places where the effects of climate change are less pronounced. Mountains are still going to be cooler than other places all year round, and will still have more snow than other regions in the near future, she said.
With so many people coming from far and wide to visit the mountains, making sure they are prepared will help them find joy in the changing landscape, steward it, and stay safe meanwhile, said Charlie Buterbaugh, director of external affairs at the Mount Washington Observatory.
“The wave is happening, right? And so I think we see our role as educating people who are coming from metropolitan regions about this special place, and how to recreate responsibly,” he said. 
Sarah Nelson, director of research with the Appalachian Mountain Club, prepares to demonstrate proper snowpack measuring technique on Nov. 18. Snowpack depth measurements collected by laypeople and scientists alike are an important part of the data the AMC and other local research organizations collect on climate change and weather in the region, Nelson said.

BOILING SPRINGS, S.C. — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied more than 1,700 measles cases and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
Florida governor’s administration pushes to eliminate state’s vaccine mandates

South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as New Mexico, Arizona and Kansas. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation and “health freedom” ideologies promoted by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
Schools and ‘small brush fires’
Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before COVID,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.
Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to data published by The Post and Courier. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.
‘Health freedom’
In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.”
“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”
Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.
In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a COVID-19 vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for COVID-19 vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their COVID-19 response. In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.
South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for COVID-19 vaccines.
But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”
The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”

LaRose has flagged hundreds of registrations since taking office. State and county prosecutors have largely dismissed his allegations as meritless. Earlier this month, LaRose tried again and sent those cases to U.S. Department of Justice.

The last-minute changes to S.B. 293 will give much greater weight to LaRose’s regular reviews of the voter rolls.
Not only does it require audits occur monthly (despite federal law barring removals during a 90-day ‘quiet period’ before federal elections), but it also directs county boards to cancel a person’s registration without notice if the secretary determines the person isn’t a citizen.
Just last year, LaRose’s reviews erroneously targeted several recently naturalized citizens.
Testifying before an Ohio House committee the day prior to the bill’s passage, LaRose downplayed the changes.
The more than 7,000 ballots that arrived after Election Day in 2024?
“That is .0129% of the overall,” LaRose said, noting that already two-thirds of states have the same deadline in place.
The move to cancel registrations? LaRose sidestepped that, insisting the change “simply” defines federal data as “one of the approved sets of data for conducting voter list maintenance.”

The deadline
The impetus for changing Ohio’s absentee ballot deadline came, at least in part, from the U.S. Department of Justice.
In March, President Trump asserted in an executive order that all ballots arriving after Election Day should be thrown out.
LaRose told lawmakers DOJ attorneys have warned his office they would sue Ohio if it didn’t change state law to comply.
“I think it’s just very unusual for the Department of Justice to act as the President’s lobbyist,” Center for Election Innovation and Research Executive Director David Becker said of that pressure campaign.
The Department of Justice’s role is to enforce federal law, he said, and there’s no federal law defining the time when ballots need to arrive.
“There is no federal law that does that whatsoever,” he said, “and for the Department of Justice to be pressuring states is, at best, highly unusual, and at worst, outright corrupt.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a case out of Mississippi in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled against a similar grace period.
Several state lawmakers voiced concern about what happens if the court eliminates grace periods nationwide. And worse, the possibility of that decision landing next summer between Ohio’s primary and general elections.
Becker acknowledged that decision could go either way but called the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation “unusual.”
The audits
The organization VoteRiders helps voters get the ID they need to cast a ballot in their state.
The group’s legal director, Ceridwen Cherry, said routinely scouring federal database and Ohio’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles records to “root out suspected noncitizen voters is a solution in search of a problem.”
Information in the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database isn’t always up to date, she explained.
There’s also no state or federal law requiring naturalized citizens to update their driver’s license.
That means a new citizen could register to vote, and one or both of the databases LaRose uses to review their registration might wrongly indicate that they’re ineligible.
And Cherry worries the bill “does not give incorrectly flagged eligible US citizens a chance to prove their citizenship. Instead, they would be purged from voter rolls without warning or recourse.”
VoteRiders worked with the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement to study Americans’ access to documentary proof of citizenship.
They found more than 21 million Americans, or more than 9% of the voting age population, do not have ready access to the documents they need.
Cherry warns those two factors together — lack of warning and lack of access — could lead to otherwise eligible voters being disenfranchised because they don’t have what they need and don’t have time to get it.
DeWine’s call
The governor has ten days to decide on whether to sign the bill once it arrives on his desk.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the Senate has not yet sent it to the governor.
But the Ohio Voter Rights Coalition, which includes groups like the League of Women Voters, Common Cause, and the ACLU of Ohio, is already urging DeWine to reject the bill.
In a press release the group criticized the measure for “needlessly eliminat(ing) the post-election window” and imposing audits “that will drastically increase the number of provisional ballots.”
And the coalition calls back to DeWine’s own 2023 signing statement when he approved Ohio House Bill 458.
That bill required voters show photo ID to cast a ballot and directed the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to put a “noncitizen” designation on driver’s licenses or IDs issued to people who aren’t U.S. citizens.
Notably, just like the bill headed to DeWine’s desk, H.B. 458 shortened the deadline for absentee ballots — cutting it from 10 days post-election to four.
Should DeWine sign the bill, Ohio voters will see a different absentee ballot deadline in three successive federal elections.
On signing the bill, DeWine said, “I believe with the enactment of the new election integrity provisions in House Bill 458, this matter should be settled, and I do not expect to see any further statutory changes to Ohio voting procedures while I am Governor.”
The Ohio Voter Rights Coalition is now calling on DeWine to “veto this anti-democratic bill immediately, stand by his word, and reaffirm his commitment to Ohio voters.”

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”

‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.

The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

But one survey found that the overall price of Thanksgiving dinner in Connecticut is down from last year.
In Connecticut, there have been 41 cases of the avian flu in wild birds this year alone, and 102 total since 2022, according to the USDA. Five flocks in Connecticut have been infected since 2022, three in 2025. And nationwide, the USDA projected that the cost of wholesale, whole turkey would increase at the end of this year after production fell in January due to the avian flu.
However, projections from the American Farm Bureau Federation found that many stores surveyed were offering holiday deals on turkey, decreasing consumer costs.
Overall, the survey projected that a meal serving 10 people could cost $55.81, down from last year but still higher than the organization projected in 2021. But since this decrease was due partly because of deals grocery stores put on, Thanksgiving meal costs may vary based on store and location. 
According to Datasembly, a market research company that assess grocery prices from 150,000 stores across the country, prices rose, and poultry saw a 4.4% index change in Connecticut 4.4%. But just across the border in Massachusetts, there was a drop in prices, and a drop of 2.1%.
Side dishes like mac and cheese, and canned goods like vegetables, pumpkin and cranberry sauce, have seen price increases since last year.
Because of the Trump administration’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, the price of canned goods has risen since last year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that September 2024 to September 2025, canned good prices increased by 5% in U.S. cities.
And pasta, one of the goods that could be affected by President Donald Trump’s proposed 107% tariff on Italian imports, is crucial to one of the nation’s favorite sides — mac and cheese.
An annual “sides report” from Campbell’s found that in the majority of U.S. states, including Connecticut, stuffing was the most popular of all the Thanksgiving sides. The survey also found that 67% of all Americans preferred eating sides over the main course.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/A3hFo-cost-of-wholesale-whole-turkey-in-the-u.s.-cents-per-lb--1024x662.png,,,2025-11-27 05:57:09.395674

The bill started out as legislation that prohibits a NIL contract from remaining in effect after a student athlete is done playing college sports. 
Former Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. and Fanatics were involved in a legal dispute over a NIL deal after Fanatics claimed Harrison did not meet his obligation. 
“His NIL agreement continued on after his eligibility at college and went into when he was in the NFL,” said Ohio Sen. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville. 
“This simply just does not allow these agreements to go past your eligibility in college, and if it does do that, then it ceases to exist.” 
Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said he liked the NIL provisions in the bill.

“When one of my football players is taken advantage of … there’s something we need to do about this,” he said. 
“We can’t have these athletes be used and abused and taken advantage of.” 
Ohio state Rep. Munira Abdullahi, D-Columbus, said it is important to protect student-athletes. 
“When a kid shows up to college as a star recruit there are agents waiting to lock them into contracts that drain money from them for years,” she said. 
Several last minute additions were added to the bill including transferring $40 million from the general revenue fund to go toward the post-traumatic stress fund for first responders; changing the funding formula for nursing home payments from the state; and paying publicly funded child care based on attendance instead of enrollment, among other additions. 
“This does not necessarily mark the end of budget corrections,” Ohio state Sen. Jerry Cirino R-Kirtland, said. 
Lawmakers in both chambers on both sides of the aisles criticized not having much time to look over all the changes made to the bill. 
“I’m not a big fan of these Christmas tree bills,” DeMora said. “I think too much stuff is crammed into it at late hours, and we don’t get to see it all.”
Ohio state Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester, said the changes happened last minute. 
“I truly didn’t have time to vet it,” he said. 
Ohio state Sen. Al Cutrona, R-Canfield, was the only senator to vote against the bill last week. 
“I have major concerns with the process that’s being conducted here in this chamber,” he said. “Maybe the policy is good, maybe it’s bad. I can’t tell you one way or another, because, well, frankly, we haven’t had any true eyes on it. … I’m going to have to vote no on a very good bill.”
Rep. Abdullahi said she reluctantly voted f0r the bill.
“(Changes) were dropped at the eleventh hour and they affect hundreds of millions of your tax dollars,” she said. 
“We’re using what was once a good, simple, common sense bill to quietly move hundreds of millions of dollars while Ohioans are not looking. If anyone else did this would be calling it money laundering, but when we do it, it’s a budget correction bill.”
State Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, and four Republicans state Reps. Levi Dean, Jason Stephens, Jennifer Gross, and Michelle Teska voted against the bill. 
Many lawmakers voiced support for the post-traumatic stress fund for first responders. 
“I wish it was more money,” DeMora said. “I wish it was over more years, but I will certainly settle for the $40 million one time placement of this money into that fund.”
The average person sees one to three traumatic events in their lifetime while first responders see an average of 11 traumatic things a month, said state Sen. Thomas Patton, R-Strongsville. 
“They’re seeing the very, very worst things we can’t possibly imagine,” he said. 
Democratic state Rep. Erika White’s husband is a firefighter in the Toledo area. 
“I’ve watched him carry home the kind of pain that no one sees,” she said. “… (Post-traumatic stress) doesn’t end when the siren stops. It follows them into our homes, to our marriages, in our daily lives.”

(Photo by Alan MacRae/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Bulletin’s three-part series, by William Skipworth, on our state’s disability residential services system is painful to read. It chronicles stories of criminal behavior — neglect, physical assaults, sexual assaults, and preventable deaths of residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities — with families left seeking answers through the courts. The New Hampshire Bulletin and Mr. Skipworth have done New Hampshire a great service by bringing these stories to light.
As someone who has worked in disability policy research for decades, I wish these stories were anomalies. They are not. They are the result of historic prejudice, leading to chronic underfunding, and subsequently to inadequate staffing with insufficient training and oversight.  
Over the course of American history, many people with disabilities were housed and isolated in ever larger, more centrally controlled institutions — from local almshouses in Colonial America to county poor farms in the 1800s to state-run schools and hospitals in the 1900s — all in the name of safety and cost savings. Examples include the Strafford County Poor Farm, New Hampshire School for the Feebleminded (renamed the Laconia State School), and the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane (renamed the New Hampshire State Hospital). However, the promises of cost savings were never realized. Within these centralized institutions came neglect and abuse on an industrial scale, and in many states, forced sterilization, including New Hampshire. 
A movement to eliminate these institutions — the Deinstitutionalization Movement — picked up steam in the 1970s, particularly with the release of Geraldo Rivera’s 1972 documentary, “Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace.” Like the Vietnam War, television footage dramatically changed public awareness. In turn, public pressure led to changes in federal policy, which created small group homes and, still further, home and community-based services (including adult foster care) that are intended to support independent living and keep people with their families and in their communities. As of 2023, about 6,500 people with disabilities live in a mix of these residential settings that are run by private businesses and funded with state and federal funds. 
New Hampshire confronted its own institutional past much later. The 2010 documentary “Lost in Laconia,” offered a stark retrospective on the Laconia State School and reminded us why the state committed to community-based supports in the first place — and what can happen when oversight weakens or systems lose sight of the people they exist to support.
While abuse and neglect are no longer committed on an industrial scale, Mr. Skipworth’s reporting reveals similar patterns of criminal behavior continuing in smaller, more isolated and concealed places. 
So where do we go from here?
This moment calls for a shared commitment — from state leaders, service providers, families, and the broader public. First and foremost, when abuse or neglect is suspected, it must be reported. New Hampshire’s mandatory reporting law applies to everyone. You do not need proof; you need only reasonable suspicion to call local law enforcement or the appropriate state agency. These are crimes and must be treated as such. 
But reporting alone will not fix a system under strain. A stronger federal and state investment is needed to fairly compensate family caregivers — who often provide the very services the residential system struggles to deliver — and to build a stable workforce of well-trained direct support professionals. Turnover is extraordinarily high in-home health and personal care occupations; as a labor economist, I can say clearly that the people who stay in this work do so out of dedication, not pay. Sustaining a dependable, skilled workforce requires real investment.
Everyone in New Hampshire has a role to play. This is the time for us to fully commit to the inclusion of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in everyday life — in schools, workplaces, civic spaces, places of worship, and neighborhoods across New Hampshire. Inclusion brings sunlight into the smaller, more isolated settings where abuse can take root. Think of how we notice when a friend, neighbor, or colleague is struggling: they are not at work, not at church, not leaving the house. Those same natural cues protect people with disabilities when they are part of our daily lives. Abuse and neglect are far more difficult to hide when someone is known and seen regularly in their community.
Inclusion is not only the ethical thing to do; it is a practical, cost-effective way to ensure safety. 
When people with disabilities participate fully in community life, we — the public — become partners in accountability. We notice. We ask questions. We intervene. We lift up the expectation that everyone belongs, and everyone deserves to be safe.
The Institute on Disability (IOD) was created in the wake of deinstitutionalization and serves as New Hampshire’s University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD). As a UCEDD, we provide training, technical assistance, and research to strengthen disability services and promote full inclusion. But institutions like ours cannot do this work alone. We must redouble — and broaden — our collective efforts to ensure that New Hampshire’s disability service systems are properly funded and equipped to guarantee the full participation and safety of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

(Photo by WEWS.)A new bill proposed by an Ohio Republican lawmaker would revoke the brand new ability for high school athletes to be compensated for their Name, Image and Likeness. Just Monday, the state’s student athletic association announced it had voted to allow for the NIL deals.
The legislation, shared with us, is sponsored by state Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond). It states that high schoolers can’t participate in NIL deals — like basketball superstar Marcus Johnson.
“It’s a blessing from God,” Johnson told us earlier this year about his athletic ability and winning awards.
He has national recognition, fans screaming for him at games — and tens of thousands of followers on Instagram.
“We have received a lot of offers from clothing lines to drinks, drink companies,” Sonny Johnson, Marcus’ father and coach, said.
But he hasn’t accepted any deals, since he’s only a senior at Garfield Heights. But Sonny is thrilled that athletes like Marcus and their families will now get a chance for a slam dunk.
“If you can get a kid that could get a couple thousand dollars without the parents having to give it to him, it saves us some groceries,” Sonny said, laughing.
The Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) announced Monday that it passed new bylaws that allow the high school athletes to be compensated through appearances, licensing, social media, endorsements and/or the use of branding based on their public recognition or notoriety.
It also establishes limitations so that athletes do not hurt their eligibility when it comes to recruiting.
“Having NIL in Ohio would definitely be great for me and my family,” Marcus said.
But those opportunities may be blocked.
“Earning money is not what Ohio high school sports is about,” Rep. Bird said.
Less than 24 hours after the announcement, the Republican lawmaker proposed a bill to ban NIL deals for high school student-athletes.
“We want our sports to be about character development and leadership and fitness and social connections and all of those kinds of things — and not creating even more pressure for our students,” Bird continued.
Students shouldn’t be earning more than coaches and referees, he said, and the athlete’s focus shouldn’t be on endorsements.
“When you’re using public money to create gymnasiums and stadiums and weight rooms, we should be using that publicly paid-for facility for those kinds of things and not for the athlete to be earning NIL money,” the lawmaker said.
Sonny said opponents to NIL don’t understand. Marcus added that 44 other states already approve of NIL for high schoolers.
“I’ve just seen a lot of talent leave Ohio… A lot of talent that want to experience other places because they have NIL,” Marcus said.
The bill is in the early stages and isn’t expected to be heard for several months. Still, athletes hope it’s an airball.
This debate stems from a court case.
A Franklin County high school football player’s mother filed a lawsuit against the OHSAA in mid-October, arguing that students should be permitted to make money from their image. Her son had already missed out on more than $100,000 in potential NIL deals, the mom said.
Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Jaiza Page issued an order in late October, allowing students to make money.
Thus, OHSAA had an emergency referendum vote. It passed.

(Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)The Thursday of Thursdays has arrived, that being our yearly attempt to act grateful and kind while huddling around an enormous dead bird.
Ha! I kid, because Thanksgiving of course lives in our hearts and minds as a meaningful holiday, not just an excuse for four days away from work and trampling our fellow humans in a quest for flat-screen television sets. We come together to express thanks — for the love that surrounds us, for our family and friends, and for other things that make for dreadfully dull columns. I call them like I see them, folks.
In the interest of shaking things up, here are a dozen messages of thanks for the decidedly cruddy autumn of 2025. It’s bad out there! 
I’m thankful for Senate President Ty Masterson’s close reading of my Kansas Reflector columns. He’s used some of my words for an ad, which I can assure you was not my intent. His gubernatorial campaign should stay tuned for my next column, which will no doubt be even more complimentary!
I’m thankful for President Donald Trump, who has contributed to the civil discourse we all value by calling reporters “piggy,” “insubordinate” and “ugly” in recent days. Here in Kansas, we have to sit so far away from Republicans we can’t even hear what they’re calling us!
I’m thankful for Gov. Laura Kelly’s victory lap in Newsweek, where she’s profiled as a Democrat who can set an example for the nation. I might feel even more thankful if there were more than the one, single, soon-to-depart Laura Kelly.
I’m thankful for the spread of artificial intelligence, which has nearly reached the level of Kansas lawmakers, all the while enriching tech titans and literally driving people insane. Nothing problematic will ever come from this!
I’m thankful for House Speaker Dan Hawkins’ thin-skinned fit of pique in punishing Republicans who wouldn’t call for a special session. That will definitely encourage no one else to run for speaker in January, Dan!
I’m thankful for the hundreds of books I have piled up around my room and definitely plan to read some day. I’m not just creating a hoarding situation and/or fire hazard.
I’m thankful for the fact that hot, young, fresh artists like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and the Beatles have released enormous multi-disk boxed sets for the holiday season. We need to hear more even minute variations of their previously released recordings.
I’m thankful for the Kansas Republican Party, which showed its deep commitment to equality and justice by condemning hateful texts from young staffers while simultaneously posting racist memes about Kelly. Only the best sombreros for our state GOP!
I’m thankful for those in Kansas who voted for a candidate and administration that promised a wholesale rollback of civil liberties and war on the poor, embodied in Project 2025. Looks like you got what you voted for! Hope you enjoy all those tariff-inflated prices this holiday season.
I’m thankful for the way that Kansas Republicans so bravely condemned homophobia in August — when it meant being able to go after a Democrat. What a coincidence!
I’m thankful for all the earth-shaking decisions that Kansans will get to make next year: our governor, D.C. delegation, state Legislature and method of selecting state Supreme Court justices. I’m sure that will all go well and there’s absolutely nothing to be concerned about!
Finally, and more seriously.
I’m actually thankful for all those who made this a joyous year for me personally, regardless of the political and cultural headwinds. By that I mean my family and friends, the amazing Kansas Reflector staff and community, my poetry night comrades, and the mensches at the University Press of Kansas.
You’ve all indulged and encouraged me through these turbulent months. I appreciate it more than words can say. May your Thursday of Thursdays be the Thursday-ist it can be.

	But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America — at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
‘Days of Thanksgiving’
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Image: Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.
Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961-1024x653.jpg,,,2025-11-27 04:56:33.273872

Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, speaks ahead of a bill signing for two reproductive rights policies at the Colorado Capitol on April 24, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state Sen. Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat who served for more than a decade in the Colorado General Assembly, was killed Wednesday night in a multi-vehicle crash south of Denver.
“Our state is shaken by the loss of Sen. Faith Winter, and I send my deepest condolences to her children, loved ones, friends, and colleagues across our state,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.
“Faith was a fierce advocate for hardworking Coloradans, women, and families, and our climate,” Polis added. “I’ve known Faith for nearly twenty years, first as an organizer for environmental causes and then expanding women’s representation and leadership, and finally, as a state senator. I have had the honor of working with her on many issues to improve the lives of every person and family in our great state, and tackling climate change.”
At least three other people were injured in the crash, which occurred on northbound Interstate 25 near the Dry Creek Road exit, according to South Metro Fire Rescue and the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office.
Before winning election to the Senate in 2018, Winter, a former environmental nonprofit director, served two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives.
She served as chair of the Senate’s Transportation and Energy Committee, spearheading efforts to modernize Colorado transportation funding, expand public transit investments and reduce vehicle pollution. She was a co-sponsor of House Bill 19-1261, a landmark 2019 climate action law that established the state’s first statutory greenhouse gas reduction targets.
“Words cannot express how deeply heartbroken we are tonight as Colorado mourns the loss of an exceptional legislator, a champion for working people, and a steadfast defender of our environment and abortion rights,” Colorado House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, and House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, said in a statement.
Senate President James Coleman and Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, both Denver Democrats, called Winter “a dedicated public servant whose commitment to the people of Colorado never wavered.”
Senator Winter was a colleague whose presence brought warmth and an invaluable perspective to the Capitol. We will miss her leadership, her partnership, and her deep commitment to a brighter Colorado,” Coleman and Rodriguez said. “Our hearts are with Senator Winter’s family and friends as they navigate this unimaginable loss.”

Gators are ""part of what makes Florida Florida,"" said author Rebecca Renner.The Pilgrims were idiots. If they had just taken a sharp left at Plymouth Rock and sailed southward for another 500 miles, they could have spent that first winter luxuriating at a hotel in St. Augustine.
The Spanish settlers in St. Augustine had beaten them to the New World by more than 50 years. They’d also beaten the Pilgrims to the idea of holding a Thanksgiving feast.
The original celebrants were Spanish explorers and Native Soon-To-Be-Americans, and instead of turkey, they dined on salt pork and garbanzo beans. Then they probably got into an argument over whether that one side dish should be called “stuffing” or “dressing.”
Because of that history, I always think of Thanksgiving as the most Florida of the holidays and always look for something we should all be thankful for.
This isn’t easy to do these days amid exorbitant grocery prices, skyrocketing insurance rates, and widespread political insanity: “Hey, let’s revive the reputation of Red Scare bully Joe McCarthy while the president has a lovefest with a guy he says is a communist!”
But if you look for blessings, you’ll find them, sometimes in the most unlikely places. Today, I want to tell you why we should all be thankful for alligators.
No, not the college football team that’s 3-8. I mean our official state reptile that lurks in every body of water in Florida that’s larger than a mud puddle.
Some people find them terrifying because of their role as predators in the whole “Circle of Life” thing. But I’m here to tell you that alligators have many admirable qualities. For instance, they’re our first line of defense against the pythons invading the Everglades.
And I know of three instances in which alligators helped the cops nab fleeing suspects. Talk about taking a bite out of crime!
What’s most amazing, though, is that there was a time when they were on the endangered species list.
And now they may wind up saving us.
Trading gator for beer
Gators “are part of what makes Florida Florida,” said Rebecca Renner, who wrote the riveting true-crime book “Gator Country” about a particularly wild gator poaching case.
Rebecca Renner via Goodreads
Gators are so identified with the state, she said, that “a lot of people who come here want to see them.” That’s why we have such thriving attractions as Gatorland and the St. Augustine Alligator Farm.
Fueling their fascination with gators is the fact that a lot of the wacky Florida man and woman stories you see are also Florida gator stories.
“Florida man tries trading gator for beer.” “Forida woman fights to keep her pet alligator who wears clothes and rides an ATV.” “Florida woman pulls alligator out of pants during traffic stop.” That last one, which involved turtle smuggling, inspired Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen to write a lovely song called, “She Had Turtles in Her Trunk and a Reptile in Her Pants.”
Probably the best-known one happened in 2016, when a 24-year-old Florida man pulled up to a Wendy’s in Royal Palm Beach and tossed an alligator through the drive-thru window. He did it as a prank, but the drive-thru clerk was not amused. She was so terrified she dove out through the same window by which the 3-foot gator entered.
My favorite part of the story is that the guy was charged with assault with a deadly weapon — to wit, the gator.
The first biologist to study gators would have been on the drive-thru clerk’s side.
Slaughter for fun and fashion
Pioneering naturalist William Bartram, who visited Florida in the 1770s, was the first scientist to document alligators’ behavior. He was clearly scared of them, considering them man-eating monsters.
William Bartram via Independence National Historical Park Collection
There were a lot of gators back then, he reported: “The alligators were in such incredible numbers, and so close together from shore to shore, that it would have been easy to have walked across on their heads, had the animals been harmless.”
When he tried fishing, a congregation (yes, that’s the word) of gators went after his boat, he wrote.
“I was attacked on all sides,” Bartram wrote.  “… Two very large ones attacked me closely, at the same instant, rushing up with their heads and part of their bodies above the water, roaring terribly and belching floods of water over me.”
When another one attacked later, he dispatched it with a single shot to the head. After that, Bartram would as soon shoot gators as look at them.
Bartram’s drawing of two alligators in the St. Johns River via State Library and Archives of Florida
Lots of other Florida tourists reacted the same way. From the 1800s to the 1960s, there was a wholesale slaughter. An incredible number of nitwit Northerners thought that no vacation in Florida was complete unless they’d bagged a gator or twelve.
Some of the shooting was for fun. Some was for fashion.
An 1893 federal fisheries report found that gator hides had become a highly lucrative industry, with Florida the center of the trade. The report figured 2.5 million hides had been shipped out of the state since 1880. Two Jacksonville firms handled more than 60,000 skins in a single year.
The alligator was being ‘‘systematically and relentlessly hunted in nearly every part of Florida,’’ the report noted, predicting that it was ‘‘only a question of time when this valuable fishery resource will become exhausted.’’
Saving the species
Five decades ago, when a Florida man named Nathaniel Reed worked as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, he changed the nation.
This is a different kind of Florida man story than you’re used to.
Nat Reed via National Audubon Society
Reed had spent his childhood collecting butterflies, jotting notes on all the birds he saw around Jupiter, and fishing in Hobe Sound. He loved fishing so much, his mother joked that he emerged from the womb carrying a fly rod.
The grown-up Reed was alarmed by reports of wildlife disappearing around America. He gathered a group of like-minded federal officials at a Chinese restaurant in Washington. Between egg rolls and moo goo gai pan, they jotted down the wording for what would become the Endangered Species Act.
The bill passed Congress by a nearly unanimous vote in 1973 and was signed into law by Reed’s Republican boss, Richard Nixon.
“We had the fervor of youth and a sense of high ethical standards for how man should treat his fellow creatures on spaceship Earth,” Reed told me years later.
The earliest list of endangered species included several well-known Florida critters, including the panther, the manatee, and — believe it or not — the alligator.
As difficult as it may be to imagine, we nearly had a Florida without alligators. Frankly, that wouldn’t be much like the Florida we know and love, would it?
The gator renaissance
The comeback began with the state and federal government setting aside places for the gators to exist undisturbed by intrusive humans, Renner said.
State parks like Hillsborough River and Highlands Hammock, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, as well as Everglades National Park, opened in 1947, gave the gators to live and thrive in their native habitat.
Then, in the 1970s, under what became known as the Clean Water Act, developers began to think twice (at least at first) about whether they should wipe out wetlands to build houses, stores, and offices. That, too, benefited the gators.
“They’re very resilient animals,” Renner said. “Their comeback helps us be hopeful for other animals to do the same.”
The gators’ revival also helped other animals that depend on them, she pointed out. Gators dig holes that become wet refuges for fish, turtles, and frogs during droughts.
The gator renaissance is now in full swing. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimates we have more than 1 million roaming through all 67 Florida counties.
We have so many gators that the FWC has launched a Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program, or SNAP for short, to trap the ones that cause trouble. If anyone tells you bureaucrats have no sense of humor, tell ’em about SNAP.
But the programs that brought the gators back from the edge of extinction have now themselves become endangered.
The real predators
Last week, the Trump Administration proposed major rollbacks for both the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act.
For the Clean Water Act, his Environmental Protection Agency said it would redefine what’s protected to “exclude many wetlands and streams across the country. The changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85% of all wetlands nationwide,” The New York Times reported.
So much for sparing all that gator habitat. Looks like it’s going to be covered by asphalt now.
As for the Endangered Species Act, his Interior Department announced several proposed changes to such things as “critical habitat” and other aspects of the law.
The most radical change calls for counting economic impact, instead of only focusing on what the science says about protecting an endangered species. Up until now, science alone determined whether a species was endangered. Not anymore.
“For example, if the Trump administration determined that the economic harm to a golf course would be greater than protections for the Florida panther, then they could make that determination,” Susan Holmes, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition, told ABC News. “It would essentially potentially put money over the science.”
The folks who are applauding this are the folks who would make a quick buck by destroying wetlands and wildlife habitat — the homebuilders, the real estate moguls, the big-money developers. You know, the real predators.
But what’s happened recently with the gators shows that we humans have no idea how economically valuable our wildlife can be when we preserve it.
In the blood
Biologist Kent Vliet became fascinated by gators when he first got to Gainesville. At the University of Florida, the young grad student was dispatched to study the mating habits of alligators.
Kent Vliet holding a gator skull via subject
To do that, Vliet traveled to the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and talked to the staff. He wanted to tag their gators so he could observe them. A staffer helped him lasso them, tie them up, weigh them, and attach an identification marker to their tails.
“The biggest one I’d ever grabbed before then was 4 feet,” Vliet said. “There were some 11-footers in there. … When we lassoed one, I’d jump on the back of the animal to restrain it and tape its jaws up.”
Adrenaline roaring through his veins, Vliet became hooked on working with gators. That was in 1980, and 45 years later he’s still at it. He’s even written a book: “Alligators: The Illustrated Guide to Their Biology, Behavior, and Conservation.”
What Vliet has been working on in the last few years struck me as particularly fascinating. He’s been collecting alligator blood for scientists studying its special properties.
Turns out gators have a superpower.
“You often see gators living in some pretty grody habitat with a huge open wound,” he explained. “Then it just heals up, and they go back to living their life.”
Their amazing healing ability comes from substances in the gators’ blood known as peptides. Scientists at George Mason University have been trying to identify those antiviral peptides, then extract and isolate them.
So far, they’ve found there could be thousands, each targeted to block a different strain of bacteria, Vliet said. Their goal is to figure out how to use those peptides to protect us humans from infections, too, including from COVID and HIV.
“And all from an animal that a lot of people wish didn’t even exist,” Vliet said.
So, say a prayer of thanks today that we saved the alligators, because now they’re likely to save us — assuming we can keep them around a while longer.
But with this proposed rollback of the laws that led to the gators’ revival, I have to wonder what we might lose if they go away again. And what other critters have superpowers that could help us if we take better care of their habitat?
Somehow, I don’t think our Circle of Life will turn out so well without them.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Visitors-look-at-gators-at-Homosassa-Springs-via-FSA.jpg,,,2025-11-27 00:56:58.083797

If Rauscher and Tilton are confirmed, their House seats would become vacant, and Dunleavy would be required to appoint replacements within 30 days of their resignations. 
The two Senate seats became vacant after Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, resigned to run for lieutenant governor and Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned to run for governor.

Dunleavy’s picks were due no more than 30 days after their resignations, but he acted earlier, which will allow the replacement legislators to take office before the regular legislative session convenes in January.
“I can’t think of two Alaskans more qualified and committed to public service to serve in the Alaska Senate than Representatives Rauscher and Tilton,” Dunleavy said in a statement announcing the selections. “I have known and worked with both for as long as I have been in public office and I look forward to working collaboratively with them as senators. I also want to thank the local Republican district committees for taking the time to meet, deliberate, and send forward names for these seats. This process works best when the people closest to the communities are involved.”
Tilton, first elected to the House in 2014, was Speaker of the House from 2023 through 2024. Reached by phone on Wednesday in the middle of Thanksgiving shopping, she referred to a statement on her Facebook page.
“I look forward to collaborating with my Senate colleagues to advance sensible policy solutions, foster an energy renaissance, and usher in an era of renewed prosperity for all Alaskans,” the statement said in part.

Rauscher said he’s already at work on a letter thanking Dunleavy for his appointment, but he declined to say what he thinks his confirmation chances are.
“It’s an honor,” Rauscher said of the appointment, “and I feel like it was quite the undertaking — the process — and to have it this close to seeing what the final outcome is, is always a relief in some ways, but it’s also very exciting that I am this close. So I appreciate the fact that the governor did consider me and thought highly enough of me to appoint me.”
Several senators said they expect Rauscher and Tilton to be confirmed, but each declined to say how he or she will vote, citing the need to work with them regardless.
Of the nine Republican senators who will be voting on this weekend’s confirmations, five are members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority caucus, and four are members of the Senate’s all-Republican minority.
Shower and Hughes were members of the House minority, and their replacements are expected to be as well.
Stevens said he’s conducting the confirmation vote by secret ballot in order to avoid the possibility of hurt feelings.
“I don’t want to have anybody have bad feelings when we start working together in January,” he said.
Stevens said he wants to give the House’s replacement process as much time as possible, since that will involve the appointment of two people new to the Legislature who will need to hire staff and uproot their lives in order to arrive in Juneau in January and be ready to work.
“I just want to make sure the House has all the time they need,” he said.

The North […],"North Carolina Republican legislative leaders approved a new congressional map that aims to flip a Democratic seat represented by Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)North Carolina Republican lawmakers prevailed Wednesday on a preliminary injunction that would have blocked a 2026 congressional map redrawn to favor the GOP.
The redrawn map is GOP lawmakers’ response to President Donald Trump’s push to change voting maps across the country to help Republicans retain control of the U.S. House in 2026.
The North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause of North Carolina and a group of voters identified as the Williams plaintiffs had argued that a 2026 congressional map passed by the General Assembly last month reflects unconstitutional racial discrimination.
They alleged that changes to the 1st Congressional District dismantled a region known as the Black Belt, a region spanning many counties whose voters have elected a Black member of Congress for more than 50 years.
A three-judge panel — Fourth Circuit Judge Allison J. Rushing and the Middle District’s Chief Judge Richard Myers and Judge Thomas Schroeder, all appointed by Republican presidents — found that while the plaintiffs “have shown a disparate impact on black voters, they have not demonstrated that this effect likely reflects discriminatory intent.”
The judges determined that there was not enough evidence to provide a “clear showing” that the racial discrimination claim is likely to succeed. The new congressional map will therefore go into effect even as the lawsuit continues.
In a statement on social media, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) took a victory lap, praising North Carolina Republicans who “went to work to protect the America First Agenda.”
“North Carolinians voted to send President Trump to the White House in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and this new map reflects that support,” Berger wrote. “President Trump deserves a Congress that will fight for American citizens and move his agenda forward. Today’s decision thwarts the radical left’s latest attempt to circumvent the will of the people.”
The plaintiffs and their attorneys said the ruling is highly damaging to democracy.
“We’re disappointed in the court’s decision today,” said Common Cause NC Executive Director Bob Phillips. “This ruling gives blessing to what will be the most gerrymandered congressional map in state history, a map that intentionally retaliates against voters in eastern North Carolina for supporting a candidate not preferred by the majority party.”
Hilary Harris Klein, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said the courts must live up to their responsibility to “protect voters and the right to dissent.”
“These mid-decade redistricting battles are tearing our democracy apart,” she said in a statement. “If politicians want to keep their majority in any legislative body, our Constitution should require them to do it by earning votes, not by silencing the voices of communities they disagree with after every election.”
The victory for Republicans stands in contrast to a recent ruling in Texas, the largest battleground over mid-decade redistricting, where Trump appointee Judge Jeffrey Brown found that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” (That map, too, remains in effect after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito paused the lower court ruling as litigation continues.)
North Carolina’s new map is expected to eliminate Congressman Don Davis (D-N.C.), one of three Black members of Congress from the state, resulting in an 11-3 Republican majority in the state’s delegation.
Wednesday’s ruling is likely to be appealed.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-NC-Map-1024x666.png,,,2025-11-26 19:56:56.582595

Thousands of Vermonters face the loss of Medicare Advantage plans and must navigate through a muddle of insurance regulations before open enrollment ends on December 7.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Medicare Advantage plans are leaving Vermont. Now what?.","Bouncing from plan to plan for Medicare coverage has become an inadvertent, annual tradition for Becky Beerwald.
When she moved to Essex Junction from the Connecticut coast in 2023, she selected a Medicare Advantage plan before it was discontinued for the following year. Then she enrolled in a Vermont Blue Advantage plan, only for the insurer to announce in October that it would not offer the plans in 2026. This fall, she went back to the drawing board but in an insurance landscape almost entirely stripped of the Medicare Advantage plans that nearly 51,000 people in the state had relied on. 
Beerwald is just one of the thousands of Vermonters trying to make sense of the coverage that remains available now that Medicare Advantage has essentially left the state.

This year’s open enrollment period for Medicare, which runs through Dec. 7, has been a “challenging one,” said Sam Carleton, who directs the State Health Insurance Program, a state entity that provides guidance for Medicare beneficiaries. The small office has been flooded with inquiries since the start of October, when BlueCross Blue Shield and United Healthcare’s departures from the Advantage market became public. Agewell, the elderly support agency Carleton leads in Northwestern Vermont has also seen a surge in interest for the webinars they offer to explain how Medicare works and how people can get the coverage they need under it.
Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older and those with certain disabilities. 
Medicare has four parts: Part A covers inpatient care while Part B broadly covers outpatient care, medical devices and preventative care, among other things. Together, these two are regarded as original Medicare. It generally covers 80% of the cost of services, meaning many people who opt for traditional Medicare coverage also opt for something known as a Medigap plan, or supplemental insurance, sold by a private insurer that can help cover the remaining 20% of costs. 
Medicare Part D offers prescription drug coverage, which is also provided by a private insurer. 
Part C plans bundle all of that — and often include additional benefits like dental, or vision. These plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans, are offered by private insurers. 
While many people like their Advantage plans, others can feel trapped in them because they require approval before covering some drugs and services and often require people to see in-network providers.
When the insurers providing Medicare Advantage plans in Vermont announced the end to their coverage, it gave some people a welcomed exit ramp from plans that are otherwise difficult to leave, explained Kaj Samsom, the commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, the state office that regulates insurers.
“This event, as really truly unfortunate as it is for folks who are no longer in Medicare Advantage and no longer have other options, there are some people who are probably happy,” Samsom said.

When an insurer withdraws a plan, it triggers something called a special enrollment period, which comes with different privileges than the regular open enrollment period.
In particular, it means people searching for new plans get something called “Guaranteed Issue Rights.” These rights mean that insurance companies cannot charge someone more for their insurance based on pre-existing health conditions — things like diabetes or cancer — that would make care more expensive for the insurer to pay out. 
When someone is new to Medicare and enrolling for the first time, they are also protected from this type of underwriting. But after that initial enrollment, Medigap plans can reject or charge sicker patients more based on their health history. Samsom referred to this as the “one way street” of Medicare Advantage, where individuals can’t switch to traditional Medicare without the massive cost of a Medigap supplement plan looming over them.
Now, nearly all Vermonters who bought Medicare Advantage plans will need to opt into original Medicare, with the option to buy the supplemental Medigap plans — protected from underwriting during this special enrollment. 
The issue of underwriting became particularly concerning to Beerwald. As she scoured the best Medigap plan, she said some insurers asked for her health history, despite her guaranteed issue rights. 
When open enrollment began, Beerwald said she started calling the insurers offering the least expensive Medigap plans for 2026: Medco, State Farm and Aflac. 
Each insurer offers a selection of Medigap plans: A, B, C,  D, F, G. These letter plans are standardized, so that plans with the same letter include the same benefits, no matter which insurer sells them. Price should be the only difference. 
Beerwald said she wants a G plan because it offers the best coverage with the most diverse beneficiary pool — because of a 2015 law, people who became eligible for Medicare after 2020 can’t buy Medigap plans C or F. That restriction effectively leaves plans’ pool older. Plans D and G now offer similar coverage, without the age restriction.

“My mother lived until almost 102 my dad was 87, so I’ve got a long life ahead of me,” Beerwald said. “I don’t want to be in the older pool, I want to be in the younger pool.” 
She said she worries that as the pools under plans C and F grow older and smaller over time, their premiums will soar or the plans could disappear altogether. 
“I don’t want to be in the lurch again. I want to be in the popular plan with the popular kids,” she said. 
Insurers she found that honored the guaranteed issue rights for plan G charged higher premiums. She did notice, however, that insurers would honor these rights for C and F plans. 
Eventually, she bought a TVHP Medigap Blue Plan G from BlueCross BlueShield of VT, for about $258 per month, she said.
Still, the fact that she encountered some insurers who would not honor the guaranteed issue for every letter plan conflicted with her understanding of how the law should protect that right.
Beerwald’s quest to understand and rectify this issue offers a window onto the maelstrom that can arise when private insurers are tasked with delivering a government service. She said she reached out to the state office tasked with regulating insurers, their consumer protection line, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s office, SHIP and Carleton, in an attempt to make sense of it all.
“I certainly feel that frustration. I mean, you’re in a circumstance where you’ve lost your insurance, you received notice from the federal government that you are getting a special enrollment period, and you’re able to get another plan. You’ve done the legwork. … You’ve made a choice, and you then call this insurance company, those insurance companies say sure we’ll sell you a policy, but only if you send us all your medical records. That stinks,” Carleton said.  
However, Carleton and the Department of Regulation told Beerwald — and confirmed to VTDigger — that it is legal for insurers to not apply guaranteed issue rights to every letter plan. 
It comes down to one small matter of wording in the regulation that applies to Medigap plans:  “It’s a ‘must’ for (plans) A, B, C, F,” Department of Regulation Deputy Commissioner Mary Block said. “It’s a ‘may’ for G, for people before that 2020 date.” 
“So some insurance companies will offer it, some will not,” she added.  
There’s nothing the state can do to rectify this frustration, according to Block, since federal law dictates Medigap plan regulations. 
“In Vermont, we don’t have the discretion to say Plan G is always going to be available to everybody,” she said. 
Block added that other consumers have run into confusion when dealing with insurance brokers, who may not be aware of which customers are receiving guaranteed issue rights and may mix up forms. 
The best way to combat that, Samson said, is for people to advocate for themselves and make it very clear when they are on the phone that they need the guaranteed issue rights. 
Beerwald remains unsatisfied with their explanation.
Now, the only remaining Medicare Advantage plans in the state are Humana plans in six counties — including Orange, Windham and Windsor, where many of the available care comes from providers in the Dartmouth Health network. However, Dartmouth Health has long been out of network for Humana. During a Nov. 19 town hall with the Vermont congressional delegation, Balint raised particular concern over this and cautioned beneficiaries in those counties to choose new plans.
Carleton assured that even in the counties where Humana remains, if people have lost their other Advantage plan, they should still receive guaranteed issue rights for Medigap plans if they chose to buy one and opt into original Medicare. 
“What prompts the special enrollment period is your plan leaving, not necessarily the loss of all Medicare Advantage plans,” he said. 
Carleton said he worries about the overall sticker shock that comes with Medigap plans, and  fears some people will opt into original Medicare and forgo supplemental plans, leaving them vulnerable to the 20% of costs that original Medicare doesn’t cover.
Beerwald said she’s going to end up paying more than $7,500 for insurance this year. After her Medigap plan, she said she’s buying a drug plan, vision and hearing plans, as well as a dental plan, to cover the cost of extensive dental work she needs 
She said she worries not just for herself but for other older adults who are not as savvy as navigating all the pitfalls of the insurance system. But for now, she is locked in to her BlueCross BlueShield’s plan for at least a year and whatever 2026 may have in store.

Proposed legislation crafted by Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, aims to raise more than $2 billion a year. His idea is for this money to go to education, health care and human service programs […]","Democratic state Rep.

(Courtesy of Washington State Budget and Policy Center)Democratic state lawmakers are once again eyeing a statewide version of a Seattle tax on companies with large payrolls and high-paid employees.
Proposed legislation crafted by Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, aims to raise more than $2 billion a year. His idea is for this money to go to education, health care and human service programs facing steep reductions in federal funding under the Republican-backed “Big, Beautiful Bill” President Donald Trump signed into law this year.
Scott will discuss his proposal at a news conference Tuesday. Representatives of the Washington Federation of State Employees, Service Employees International Union and pro-tax groups will join the first-term Democratic Socialist legislator.
His is the latest salvo — and likely not the last — in a tax debate expected to dominate the 2026 session that begins Jan. 12. 
Senate Democrats are drawing up designs for a possible income tax on millionaire-earners and reigniting talks on a so-called wealth tax that made it through the chamber on the final day of last session. All this because the state’s budget continues to face a shortfall and many Democrats are wary of going much further with cuts.
Republicans are slamming Scott’s proposal, arguing it will drive businesses from the state and hurt wages. They point to billions in new taxes Democrats pushed through the Legislature this year. 
Scott said his idea would help budget writers by making sure there is a stream of revenue to backfill what the federal government takes away.
Though there’s been some paring of federal resources already, he said action is needed this session because deeper cuts arrive in 2027 and 2028. Absent proactive measures by the Legislature, thousands of residents will find themselves facing greater food insecurity, less access to health care and higher costs for education, he said.
Scott’s legislation is modeled on Seattle’s JumpStart payroll expense tax and is similar to the approach Senate Democrats proposed this year but discarded in favor of other new taxes to help erase a multi-billion dollar shortfall in the state budget.
This year’s bill, Senate Bill 5796,  would remove the cap on employer payroll taxes and impose a new 5% tax on payroll expenses above the Social Security threshold of $176,100 per year. Companies with $7 million or more in payroll expenses would be subject to the tax. Those already paying the Seattle levy would be exempt.
Sen. Rebecca Saldana, D-Seattle, sponsored the bill, which is still alive heading into the 2026 session. As written it would raise about $2 billion a year, per a fiscal analysis.
How the new proposal would work
Scott’s bill would create the “Well Washington Fund” to “maintain the economic health” of the state, according to a draft of the legislation.
If passed and signed into law, it would take effect July 1, 2026 and generate an estimated $2.2 billion a year, Scott said.
It targets private employers whose workers earn more than $125,000 a year. It would impose a 5% tax on payroll expenses above that salary threshold. Companies with more than 50 workers, payroll in excess of $7 million and gross receipts of more than $5 million would pay the tax, he said.
Businesses may not deduct from employee wages to pay this tax. Like the Senate bill, if the firm already pays the Seattle levy, it would be exempt from this one, Scott said.
Roughly 4,300 businesses would be covered, he said. The state’s largest health care and social services providers would likely be exempt, Scott added.

His proposal directs all money collected in the first year into the general fund, the main account used to support public schools and state government operations. Starting the second year, 51% of the tax receipts would go into the Well Washington account and 49% into the general fund.
Expenditures from the new account would be limited to higher education, health care, especially Medicaid, cash assistance programs, and energy and housing programs.
A 25-member oversight board — of which 20 would be lawmakers — would be created. Its role would be to make recommendations to legislative budget committees on where money in the Well Washington account would be best spent. 

‘Wrong approach’
A top House Republican on Wednesday called the proposal the wrong approach to a serious problem and warned it could drive businesses out of state and hurt the state’s economy.
“You’re destroying your own tax base,” said Rep. Chris Corry, R-Yakima, the deputy leader of the House Republican Caucus. “If you want to incentivize businesses to pay people less money, this is it. In the long run, I think it will cost the state more than it makes.”
Corry chided Democrats’ pursuit of a new business tax so soon after enacting a raft of them earlier this year.
“There will always be a need. There will always be an excuse. The excuse this year is not that we’re spending more than we take in. It’s the Trump administration,” Corry said. “We will offer what we believe are solutions to help manage the state’s fiscal challenge without resorting to new taxes.”
Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, who chairs the House Finance Committee, said Wednesday she had not seen the draft legislation. She also didn’t think it would be the last revenue bill to emerge.
“Everything’s on the table. Members are going to have lots of ideas as we enter another season of dealing with a deficit,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2-3-1024x759.jpg,,,2025-11-26 19:56:56.582595

Attorneys for the state of Vermont and for the Vermont State Employees’ Association argued in court Wednesday whether a judge should prevent the upcoming return-to-office mandate for state employees. 
Gov. Phil Scott has ordered state employees to return to in-person work at least three days a week starting Dec. 1. But the state employees union has fought back in multiple venues. Earlier this month, it filed charges with the state Labor Relations Board and sued the state to demand an injunction until the labor board could rule on the case.
Washington County Superior Court Justice Dan Richardson said the matter would come down to a few key questions: whether he had statutory authority to issue an injunction, and whether the mandate constituted an “irreparable harm” that required him to intervene before the board’s decision could be made.

Union attorney Alfred O’Connell said the mandate could force dozens of state employees to relocate closer to their designated work location. He gave the example of a breastfeeding mother who would be forced to commute three hours each way to work in person. 
“She would be required to breast pump, or take her child with her on a six-hour commute,” he said. 
Attorneys for the state pushed back, arguing that the state has provided a way for employees to request an exemption based on their individual circumstances. 
“That mother and many other state employees would receive careful, individualized attention, and none would be facing a Dec. 1 deadline,” state’s attorney Peter Sterling said.

The two parties went back and forth over whether the exemptions policy was sufficient to prevent the irreparable harm question. At one point, Sean Brown, deputy director of the Agency of Administration, was called to testify on the details of the exemptions. He told the court that, out of the more than 8,000 state employees, approximately 425 had asked for an exemption. So far, only 25 of those requests had been reviewed and none had been denied. 
Sterling also argued that Vermont has a public interest in ordering state employees to the office “to provide for Vermonters the services they expect,” adding that the executive branch has the authority to decide on the best use of taxpayer money.
O’Connell shot back that the state was investing millions of taxpayer dollars in reclaiming office space for in-person work. 
“The whole thing smacks of the governor being over his skis, making a decision on the fly, and now here we are trying to clean up that mess,” he said.

But Richardson said he can’t base his ruling on that aspect of their arguments. 
“I understand attorney O’Connell’s arguments and passion,” he said. “Ultimately the Labor Relations Board has to make that determination, and this court isn’t really a position of posture or proclivity to make the movement on the policy choices that the executive branch made.”
As the hearing wrapped up, Richardson said he was unlikely to grant a very broad injunction, given the legal limitations of the court’s jurisdiction. He contemplated a narrower injunction that simply prevented people with hardships from being fired while the labor board deliberated. 
“At the same time, I think it’s fair to both sides for the court to go through these arguments a little bit further,” he said.

He said he hoped to have a decision made by the end of the day on Wednesday or on Friday. 
“I recognize there are a number of individuals making plans and expectations” based on this decision, he said.

(Photo by Thomas Quinn/University of Washington, provided by the Environmental Protection Agency)Fishery biologists expect another strong year for sockeye salmon in southwestern Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, site of the world’s largest runs of the fish, also known as red salmon.
Next year’s run is not expected to equal the magnitude of the huge runs in some recent record-breaking and near-record years, however, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s preseason forecast.
The forecast, released earlier this month, predicts a return of 45.32 million Bristol Bay sockeye salmon next year, enough to support a harvest of 33.5 million fish.
This year’s Bristol Bay run totaled 56.7 million fish, and the harvest totaled 41.2 million fish. The record highs were set in 2022, when a run of 79 million sockeye salmon supported a harvest of just over 60 million fish.
If the 2026 forecast proves to be accurate, that would place next year’s Bristol Bay sockeye run below the last 10 years’ average of 61 million fish but above the long-term average of 37.4 million fish, the department said in its statement.
While the 2026 sockeye run forecast is for 45.32 million fish, the run size could be as low as 31.12 million and as high as 59.52 million, according to the department’s calculations.
The forecast is based on an analysis of the four age classes of sockeye salmon tied to Bristol Bay’s nine different river systems, past run histories and other factors. Age classes are split by years spent in freshwater and in the ocean. Bristol Bay sockeye spend one to two years in freshwater and two to three years in the ocean.
There is a caveat to the department’s preseason prediction: Forecasting salmon returns is “inherently difficult and uncertain,” said the department’s statement.
The methodology the state uses has generally worked well for the most part, the statement said, but in the past two decades, forecasts have underestimated Bristol Bay’s sockeye returns by 14% on average. Since 2014, each year’s actual return has exceeded the state’s preseason forecast.
Observed Bristol Bay sockeye salmon returns from 2006 to 2024 are compared to preseason Alaska Department of Fish and Game forecasts, with 80% intervals shown.

The percentage of international tourists to the world’s first national park has dropped by half over six years, raising questions about the new surcharge revenue.
The post New $100 fee on Yellowstone, Grand Teton’s foreign visitors brings uncertain impacts appeared first on WyoFile .","A new $100 surcharge on foreign visitors at select national parks raises a suite of questions regarding how much revenue the fees will generate, an economic consultant in Jackson Hole said Wednesday.
The Department of Interior announced the new fee Tuesday, sparking speculation about how much money it will raise and whether it might further curtail international travel to the federal preserves and the gateway communities like Jackson and Cody whose economies run on tourism.
The fee will be imposed in 2026 on each foreign visitor to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in Wyoming. The surcharge will also apply to Yosemite, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Grand Canyon, Zion, Everglades, Acadia, Bryce Canyon and Sequoia & Kings Canyon national parks in other states.
Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum said the fees put American families first. Americans will continue to enjoy affordable access, he said in a statement, “while international visitors [will] contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
Yellowstone counted 4.7 million visitors in 2024, down from a high of 4.8 million in 2021.
What impact the surcharge will have on national parks’ revenues, which individual parks retain, is uncertain, especially in light of declining international visitation. Between 2018 and 2024, foreign visitation to Yellowstone dropped from about 30% of total visitors to 14.8%, according to the park’s statistics.
“To me the interesting question is what happened between 2018-2024 that cut international visitation. Why would international visitation fall in half?” Jonathan Schechter
As President Donald Trump’s administration curtails visas, angers Canadians by proclaiming that country should become the 51st U.S. state, imposes tariffs and takes other actions, fewer tourists may want to visit the U.S., said Jonathan Schechter, an economic consultant and a member of the Jackson Town Council.
“We’re already seeing a big drop,” Schechter said, even before Trump took office. In 2018, Yellowstone attracted 1.2 million foreign visitors, he said, citing park figures. In 2024, that number was down to 712,089.
What’s going to happen, he mused about foreign tourists, if in 2026 “they’re not feeling welcome?”
$55 million for Yellowstone?
The fee, long touted by the Property and Environmental Research Council, a Montana-based nonprofit focused on environmental conservation, will boost Yellowstone’s revenues substantially, said Brian Yablonski, the organization’s CEO.
“A $100 international visitor surcharge could generate $55 million annually at Yellowstone National Park alone, more than quadrupling that park’s revenue to address deteriorating trails, failing wastewater systems, and crumbling bridges,” he said in a statement. He referenced a 2025 study by Stephen C. Newbold, an associate professor at the Department of Economics at the University of Wyoming.
“I calculated the relative changes in visits and revenues over a wide range of entrance fees using the averaged travel costs,” Newbold wrote, “which revealed that a surcharge would need to be increased beyond $200 per visitor before revenues would decline.”
The analysis probes visitors’ spending “elasticity,” which is their response to a price increase. Entrance fees make up a small portion of the money a foreign traveler will spend on a visit to America’s national parks, he notes.
Leon Mooijan and his family traveled from the Netherlands to rent a mobile home to tour Yellowstone as part of a five-week trip across the U.S. in 2022. (Angus M. Thuermer, Jr./WyoFile)
Newbold wrote that his study has limitations because it used data from 2016 and 2018 and lacked critical information from a 2024 visitor survey. Also, the words “tariffs” and “visas” do not appear in Newbold’s 23-page paper titled “The price elasticity of the demand for visits to Yellowstone National Park.”
That suggests the research stopped short of accounting for overall international tourism trends to the U.S. Additional research could develop “more robust models of international visitor demand,” he wrote.
Today, it costs $35 per vehicle to enter Yellowstone for a week. The average vehicle carries between 2.1 and 2.8 passengers, according to Yellowstone statistics. The number varies according to entrance station and season, Yellowstone’s visitor use reporting and counting instructions state.
Shechter made some calculations using Yellowstone figures and some estimates. Those include an estimated 5% visitation growth from 2024-2026 and an average of 2.5 visitors per vehicle.
Under that scenario, if the percentage of foreign visitors to Yellowstone remains at 15%, the park would see foreign entrance fee revenues increase from $9.9 million a year to $85.2 million if the surcharges are factored in.
That’s an increase of $75.2 million.
He offered other scenarios. If international visitation in 2026 drops to 8% of all Yellowstone visitors (“all” being 5% more than the 2024 total visitation figure), the new fee would generate an additional $32.6 million.
If international visitation dropped to 1% of visitors in 2026, the park would receive $5.6 million from foreigners. That would be a drop of $4.2 million in foreign visitor entrance revenue compared to 2024.
Changing trends
Elasticity aside, the huge variable that remains is whether foreigners will be discouraged from visiting the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s foreign, immigration, visa and trade policies.
“To me the interesting question is what happened between  2018-2024 that cut international visitation,” he said. “Why would international visitation fall in half?”
Was it COVID, he wondered, or a slow recovery from that pandemic? Will it be harder to get a visa to visit the U.S. in 2026? How will international visitors react to perceived American hostility toward some foreigners?
Things have changed.
Eight years ago, Schechter said, there were planeloads of visitors from Shanghai landing in Salt Lake City, loading buses and touring Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. It is much rarer to see a coach full of foreigners wending its way through Jackson, Grand Teton and Yellowstone roads today.
The affordable American national park vacation may be becoming less affordable too, Schechter said.
“Most of the consumer spending going on right now in the U.S. is coming from the ultra-wealthy,” he said. “People who are in the middle, lower [income strata] are not spending. Those are the bulk of the people visiting Yellowstone and Grand Teton.”
Lodging revenue “has been saving the bacon of the local taxable economy,” Schechter said. In Jackson, hotels have “raised their rates, and there hasn’t been pushback yet.”
If that trend continues “that just adds even more cost to the price of a vacation,” he said. “How’s that going to affect us?

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Ethics Commission dismissed complaints against Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge and Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester, both Republicans, according to documents from the commission.
Rutledge and Jester did not violate the law pertaining to campaign contribution and expenditure reports in their candidacies for the 2026 election cycle, the commission agreed. Both decisions were 4-0 votes with one commissioner absent, according to letters Ethics Commission Director Graham Sloan sent to Rutledge and Jester on Friday.
Rutledge is seeking a second and final term as lieutenant governor, and Jester is running for commissioner of state lands.
ArkLeg Bill Tracker co-founder Janie Ginocchio filed the complaints in September, alleging that Rutledge and Jester filed incomplete and inaccurate campaign finance reports.
Ginocchio also filed complaints against Attorney General Tim Griffin, state Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, and state Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, and political action committees associated with them. She alleged they all violated campaign contribution limits and prohibitions on illegal coordination of contributions, the use of public property for campaign purposes and public servants receiving outside payment for carrying out official duties.

Ray, Gilmore and Griffin all characterized the complaints as frivolous and politically motivated. The ethics commission has not yet ruled on the allegations.
Ginnochio accused Rutledge and Jester of violating the law mandating that campaign contribution and expenditure reports include the amount, date and recipients of campaign expenses over $100.
“While the original C&E reports in question include some expenditures without providing the ‘Description of Expenditure’ as requested on the report, a plain reading of [Arkansas law] does not require a description of an itemized expenditure to be provided,” Sloan wrote in both letters. “…Based upon the available facts and the applicable law, it appears the statutory filing requirements of these provisions have been fulfilled.”
Sloan acknowledged in his letters to Rutledge and Jester that since the complaints were filed, the two candidates have amended their contribution and expenditure reports for the sake of “transparency.”
The ethics commission also dismissed a complaint against Arkansas Association of Counties Executive Director Chris Villines, in his capacity as a member of the Arkansas Cyber Response Board. Ginnochio alleged that Villines failed to disclose business or holding information on a statement of financial interest for calendar year 2024.
Friday’s letter from Sloan to Villines about the dismissal incorrectly stated that the commission had issued Villines a public letter of caution. Sloan wrote in a follow-up letter on Tuesday that this language was incorrect and that he issued an amended letter with the language removed.
Sloan sent all three letters to Ginocchio in addition to the subjects of her complaints.
Jester told the Advocate he is “thankful for the role the Ethics Commission plays, not just in punishing bad actors, but in protecting good actors from inaccurate complaints.”
Rutledge’s office could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon.

Garmatz United States Courthouse in Baltimore. District Judge Adam Abelson Wednesday granted a request to limit hunting while surveyors for a proposed power line are in the field.(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A federal judge in Baltimore ruled Wednesday that hunting should not be allowed to occur in the vicinity of surveyors while they conduct environmental studies for a proposed power line across rural parts of Central Maryland.
But in his order, Judge Adam B. Abelson said the restriction won’t take effect right away. He ordered the power line company, New Jersey-based PSEG Renewable Transmission, to coordinate with impacted landowners to develop a procedure for the hunting season that will “ensure the safety of PSEG’s surveyors while minimizing the intrusion upon Respondents’ rights to hunt on their properties.” The two side are to report back by Dec. 3.
Abelson’s ruling comes one day after a contentious hearing in Baltimore’s U.S. District Court between the two parties over hunting — and just a few days before the popular rifle hunting season for white-tailed deer is set to begin. It runs from Saturday through Dec. 13.

In his order, Abelson argued that neither the landowners nor the power company were perfectly in the right.
The power company wanted to ban hunting on any days when surveying might occur, but noted that it would attempt to make exceptions for landowners who reached out to share their hunting plans.
They argued that a blanket ban was needed because some landowners are not communicative, and others have made violent threats toward surveyors in the past. The Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the proposed line is known, has attracted considerable ire from residents in its path, who have pushed hard against its construction.
But attorneys for the landowners said that PSEG routinely issues notices to property holders that it could survey any time during a two-week period. If hunting were banned during that entire stretch, landowners could lose a substantial part of the hunting season, they argued.
On that point, Abelson agreed with the landowners.
“The Court concludes that hunting should be prohibited in areas where surveyors are working while a survey is occurring,” Abelson wrote in his order. “PSEG has not shown a basis for restricting hunting on non-survey days during the notice period.”
In a statement Wednesday, StopMPRP, a coalition of opponents that includes some of the landowners in the suit, said that Abelson’s ruling shows that PSEG is overreaching.
“The Court’s clarification today makes one thing unmistakably clear: this developer is pushing far beyond what Maryland’s laws and processes were designed to allow. PSEG continues to demand access to private land for a project that the State of Maryland has not approved, forcing families to absorb the consequences long before the Public Service Commission has completed its review.
The landowners argued that Abelson shouldn’t place any hunting restrictions at all, and that for many of them hunting is not just a sport, but is a way put food on the table and protect crops from ravenous deer. They argued that surveyors should wear bright colored orange or pink hunting gear, and that PSEG should give landowners 72 hours of notice about where and when they intend to survey, to allow hunters to prepare.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Abelson determined that solution would not do enough to protect the surveyors, who have a right to complete the studies, which will inform the Maryland Public Service Commission’s final decision on the proposed power line. Abelson did, however, require surveyors to wear the brightly-colored clothing during surveys that overlap with any Maryland hunting season.
His order also requires the opposing parties to submit, by Dec. 3, either joint or competing proposals for “how to effectuate” the hunting prohibitions “including timelines and specific information each party should be communicating to one another in order to limit hunting only to the extent necessary to protect the surveyors’ safety.”
“In the meantime, PSEG should continue coordinating with Respondents who reach out to provide them with information as to minimize the intrusion upon the use of their properties,” Abelson wrote.

(Photo by txking via Getty Images)Gov. Wes Moore’s September decision to close the aging Maryland Correctional Institute at Jessup, or MCIJ, was very good news. Why?  Because the state’s 12 other prisons don’t operate at full capacity.
With redistribution of correctional officers and incarcerated individuals, a smaller Maryland prison could work much more effectively. Our current arrangement is dangerously dysfunctional.
Maryland’s criminal justice system, in recent years, has see-sawed between tough-on-crime ideas, on one hand, that expand our prisons, and smarter ideas, on the other hand, that shrink the prisons – simultaneously, helping better to safeguard our communities.
Ten years ago, Maryland’s governor and legislators agreed on an important new bipartisan plan — the Justice Reinvestment Act (JRA). Study after study has shown that mere prison time does not reduce criminal activity upon release. So, JRA’s milestone, bipartisan plan aimed to shrink the state’s prison population and spend the tax savings on prevention measures proven to cut the crime rate.
Over the next few years, state prison populations shrank 23% and our crime rate dropped. But now, in the past two years, JRA’s plan faces a serious problem.
As of December 2024, Maryland’s prison administrators reported that they cannot hire correctional officers fast enough to replace those leaving (10.8% gap or 574 officers ). Completing fiscal year 2024, the population of incarcerated individuals was rising (a 3% rise or 560 more incarcerated people).  This is progress in the wrong direction.
Why should voters care? More than 90% of those in Maryland prisons will someday return to our communities. Their recidivism or law-abidingness correlate strongly to what happens while they are behind prison walls.

Those who complete their educations with GEDs or other degrees, those who learn marketable job skills, and those who get substance abuse treatment become much less likely to commit new offenses. Our communities get safer and healthier. And our taxpayer costs for prisons get smaller as prisons shrink.
But these protective measures (school, jobs, treatment — and more) all get canceled if there aren’t enough correctional officers to accompany  incarcerated individuals to prison classrooms.  As stated in Maryland prisons’ FY’26 budget overview, “CO [correctional officer] vacancies are particularly troubling as low staffing rates contribute to inmate idleness, safety risks, and a reduced emphasis on rehabilitation.”
For example, at Eastern Correctional Institute (ECI) this summer between late June and mid-September all prison classrooms were empty and prisoners  were locked in their cells nearly 23 hours per day, due to the shortage of correctional officers — while the temperatures regularly hit 100 degrees.
ECI isn’t the only Maryland prison with such problems.
There are proven, evidence-based solutions: One prison management system, used in seven other states (“Restoring Promise”), could reduce assaults among incarcerated individuals by 90%! Correctional officer satisfaction also greatly increases where this system is adopted. But Maryland hasn’t pursued this system yet, despite invitations over several years.
Increased use of “peer mentors” — well-trained, responsible older prisoners — also could help to counsel younger ones  and reduce the burden on prison staff. And it would provide job experience for these mentors when later released.
Increased pay for correctional officers might seem to increase the budget. But, in the long run, these dollars would reduce  mandatory overtime, reduce the quit-rate of experienced correctional officers, and reduce the need to continuously train new, inexperienced ones.
Finally, and just as important, Maryland could reduce prisons’ inflow by adopting more, proven programs for diversion:

Prosecutors and courts could give priority to sentences that provide treatment rather than those that simply imprison.
Drug courts and mental health courts could be expanded to youthful and first-time violent offenders  (currently excluded) — costing less and working better than mandatory prison sentences.
Many women and youthful offenders are pulled into criminal activities by their abusers. They could be given more low-cost counseling and less expensive  incarceration.
Marylanders on parole and probation also could get more reentry help with their problems, such as finding housing and employment. That help would cost less than more years in prison.

With Maryland’s state and local elections approaching in 2026, both voters and candidates should keep in mind that “tough on crime” may not be so smart, either for public safety or for our taxpayers’ burden.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Prison-cells-for-Aug-14-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 17:57:41.380311

Thist story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 26, 2025.
As one of three men detained by immigration police in Jeffersonville on Nov. 7 was granted bond, their lawyer has been denied access to the other two men after allegedly violating Department of Corrections policy around the use of translators.
Last Thursday, a virtual bond hearing held in Massachusetts state court morning for Jeffersonville business owner Vicente Acosta Yupangui, 40, concluded with a judge allowing Yupangui to await a removal hearing at his home. On Monday, Yupangui’s lawyer Kristen Connors was back in Vermont District Court in Burlington for another hearing, this time for a second man detained in the same Jeffersonville raid, Luis Lala Inamagua.
While the hearing pertained to filings around Inamagua’s federal case, Vermont Department of Justice lawyers were also on hand representing Northwest State Correctional Facility, where Inamagua, 46, has been detained along with Alex Japon Benites, 28, a third man detained in Jeffersonville. Until recently, Yupangui had also been detained there.

Connors said she had been “banned” from the prison and was not allowed to visit her clients in-person because she had brought an interpreter to help translate for a client who was related to that translator.
Connors said she was unaware this violated Department of Corrections policy and no one at the prison checked their identification or questioned them. When she tried to schedule an in-person meeting with Inamagua last week, she said she was informed that she had been banned from Northwest State Correctional Facility and that the state had filed an ethics complaint against Connors.
Isaac Dayno, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections, initially denied that Connors had been “banned” from Northwest State Correctional Facility and declined to share a copy of the ethics report filed against Connors.
When pressed to further clarify Connors’ denial, Dayno acknowledged that there had been “confusion around her access privileges” after a miscommunication between the department’s legal team and prison staff.
Dayno said Connors “should be cleared to enter a correctional facility to meet with a client” but warned that any accompanying interpreter would need prior clearance from the Department of Corrections as well.
“The issue was not the interpreter’s relationship to the detainee but rather the fact counsel knowingly did not disclose that relationship, which is a violation of DOC policy,” Dayno wrote. “The Department is still investigating the circumstances of this violation.”
Connors, who only learned of this clarification in the department’s policy toward her when asked about it by the News & Citizen, said she would verify this claim with the department separately, and alleged the department had initially claimed she had violated specific policies regulating prisoner visitation that she claimed she had not violated.
Roofer freed
In a virtual hearing conducted Nov. 20 through the immigration court in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, Yupangui became the first of those detained Nov. 7 in the parking lot of the Maplefields in Jeffersonville to be allowed a bond hearing.
Prior to the hearing, Connors argued in filings that although Yupangui had entered the United States outside of the proper channels, he had been an asylum seeker for over a decade. She said he is a taxpaying owner of a roofing business based in Cambridge and is the father of four children who are citizens.
At the hearing, Sarah Sawwan, a Texas-based attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security, tried to make the case that Yupangui was a flight risk, citing the fact that he attempted to flee from immigration police, as many others at the scene did, and that his original immigration to the United States being unlawful.
Julio Cortes del Olmo, the Massachusetts lawyer who represented Yupangui in immigration court, argued that the court could not prove that Yupangui was among those who had fled, and pointed to the abundance of evidence of his client’s deep ties to the Cambridge community, from his family to the many who rallied to his cause after his detainment.
Del Olmo said that Yupangui received more than 10 letters of support, which he was able to submit to the court on behalf of his client. In one of them, Alisa Anderson, an owner at Three Mountain Roofing, another Cambridge roofing company with whom Yupangui works, had paid for his legal representation and characterized him as a “hard working man.”
Judge Natalie Smith determined that the state had not successfully proven that Yupangui was a flight risk and set his bond at $5,000.
Connors confirmed that Yupangui had been released on bond to await his removal hearing, which is scheduled for early December. Inamagua and Benites had their “master calendar” hearings, the first procedural step in the removal process, rescheduled to early December as well, though Connors hopes to secure them bond hearings as well.
Of the four other state-confirmed people detained in relation to the Jeffersonville operation, three have been transferred to a family-detainment facility in Texas and another was transferred to an Arizona facility, according to advocates.

Matt Hunsaker, Maurine Hunsaker’s son, said Menzies’ death “was a complete surprise.” 
“First off, I’d say that I’m numb. And second off, I would say, grateful,” Hunsaker told Utah News Dispatch. “I’m grateful that my family does not have to endure this for the holidays.”

Menzies had been scheduled to be executed by firing squad earlier this year, on Sept. 5. As the date drew closer, his attorneys argued his dementia had worsened. He had been diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function, according to court testimony.
A state evaluator says Ralph Menzies is too ill with dementia to be executed

The Utah Supreme Court court called off the execution roughly a week before it was scheduled to take place. The justices found there was enough evidence to warrant another competency evaluation. 
A judge was scheduled to consider new reports from psychologists who evaluated Menzies in recent weeks during a multi-day court hearing that had been scheduled to start Dec. 9. Ahead of that hearing, a forensic psychologist said in an evaluation that Menzies was “not competent to be executed.” That report was one of several that were to be considered by a judge.  
Menzies killed the 26-year-old Hunsaker nearly four decades ago after kidnapping her from her job at a gas station in Kearns. He tied her to a tree in Big Cottonwood Canyon, strangled her and slit her throat, prosecutors said. She was found by a hiker days later.

The alliance of unions and school districts also added a major disability rights advocacy group to its ranks in the amended complaint that detailed how the department’s Nov. 18 announcement of six interagency agreements could harm students.
The agreements to transfer several Education responsibilities to four other departments drew swift backlash from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups, who questioned the legality of the transfers and expressed concerns over the harms that would be imposed on students, families and schools as a result. 
“Scattering Department of Education programs among agencies with no expertise in education or lacking key agency infrastructure will reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs and will prevent the type of synergy that Congress intended to achieve by consolidating federal education activities in one cabinet level agency,” the coalition, represented by the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward, wrote in the amended complaint. 
The expanded suit asks for declaratory and injunctive relief against what it describes as the administration’s “unlawful effort to dismantle the Department of Education,” pointing to the interagency agreements, mass layoffs at the department earlier this year and implementation of an executive order that called on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department.  
The Education Department clarified in fact sheets related to the agreements  with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State that it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs.”
Axing the Education Department
Trump has sought to take an axe to the 46-year-old department, saying he wants to send education “back to the states.” Much of the funding and oversight of schools already occurs at the state and local levels.
The original lawsuit, filed in March in Massachusetts federal court, was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts. 
The Tuesday filing adds The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as a plaintiff. 
Earlier this year, the case was consolidated with another March lawsuit from Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.  
“It’s no surprise that blue states and unions care more about preserving the DC bureaucracy than about giving parents, students, and teachers more control over education and improving the efficient delivery of funds and services,” Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.
Supreme Court temporarily greenlit Trump plan
In May, a federal judge in Massachusetts granted a preliminary injunction in the consolidated case, blocking the administration’s efforts, including a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump’s executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and a directive to transfer some services to other federal agencies.
A federal appeals court upheld that order in June, prompting the administration to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. 
The nation’s highest court in July temporarily suspended the lower courts’ orders, allowing the administration to proceed, for now, with those dismantling efforts.

A recently released trove of thousands of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s emails offer glimpses into his time in New Mexico, including the prominent people he invited to his home here and when he scheduled visits. 
The United States House Oversight Committee released more than 20,000 pages of records earlier this month amid a renewed push to share with the public more about the disgraced financier with longstanding ties to elected officials, business leaders and celebrities, including Former President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump. 
That release included more than 2,000 thousand emails Epstein exchanged between 2009 and 2019. Several dozen mention New Mexico or related phrases, according to Source New Mexico review, including in news articles or from Epstein himself.
Epstein bought a 7,500 Santa Fe-area property called Zorro Ranch from former Gov. Bruce King in 1993.It was sold at an undisclosed price in 2023, four years after Epstein’s death in custody awaiting federal sex trafficking charges.
According to court documents, the ranch, which has its own airstrip and helipad, was the site of sex trafficking, including by Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 as Epstein’s co-conspirator.
The emails show Epstein invited prominent figures—none of whom have been accused of any crimes associated with Epstein— including author Deepak Chopra, linguist Noam Chomsky, billionaire Tom Pritzker, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and filmmaker Bill Sieger, to his ranch at various times. It’s unclear from the emails whether any of those people took him up on his offer, though one email from Epstein to Chomsky asks if he wants to “visit again.”
The emails also show Epstein scheduled visits to the area, including for about two weeks in August 2016 and between Feb. 24 and March 1, 2017, following visits to New York and Paris. 
Trump signs bill requiring DOJ release of Epstein files

In addition to the emails, other released documents mention former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, including an excerpt of a draft article about Epstein, which Semafor confirmed came from journalist Michael Wolf. In the excerpt, Wolff recounts asking Richardson at lunch how he knew Epstein. 
“Jeffrey,” Richardson replied, according to Wolff’s telling, “is the biggest landowner in New Mexico.
In addition to efforts by Congress to release more Epstein files, two New Mexico state lawmakers have announced plans for a truth commission that will seek to document abuses and gather testimony from victims, witnesses and perpetrators in a series of public hearings. 
Reps. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) and Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) told an interim legislative committee in early November that the commission will cost about $2 million, with funding from an untapped revenue source dedicated to helping victims of sex trafficking. Lawmakers from both parties said they approved of the commission and urged the lawmakers to follow leads wherever they take them. 
Two New Mexican attorneys general have opened previous investigations into Epstein’s activities in the state: Hector Balderas’ criminal investigation in 2019 closed within the year without filing any charges. In 2023, current Attorney General Raúl Torrez investigated the role financial services companies played in failing to identify the abuses at the ranch.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  From all of us at VTDigger, a note of gratitude.","Dear Readers,
During this time of gratitude, all of us at VTDigger want to say thank you. Thank you for reading, for sharing your tips and perspectives with us and for supporting a newsroom that works every day to help Vermonters understand the world around them. Your trust is the reason we can keep doing this work.
Thanksgiving also reminds us how many neighbors may be experiencing the holiday very differently. Food insecurity has continued to rise in Vermont since 2020. The Vermont Foodbank now distributes 25 percent more food each year than it did before the pandemic. Federal funding changes have already impacted nutrition programs and food assistance access for refugees and asylum seekers. With the recent government shutdown, many food pantries faced a renewed surge in need. Looking ahead, up to 14,000 Vermonters could lose food benefits in 2026 when new federal laws take effect.
Our recent reporting underscores how quickly policy changes ripple into daily life and how urgently many Vermonters need clear information and strong community support.
This is why we partner with the Vermont Foodbank each Thanksgiving. Our job is to explain the systems that shape life in Vermont and to ensure those most affected are heard. The Foodbank’s job is to make sure our neighbors have enough to eat. Together, we can raise awareness and support Vermonters.
If you are able, there is still time to help send 3 meals to a Vermonter in need through our Thanksgiving Drive. Your gift also strengthens the reporting that sheds light on wealth, poverty and economic inequality at a time when many people are navigating real uncertainty.

Give today and send 3 meals

Most of all, thank you for being part of this community. Whether you give, read, send a tip or share our stories, you help make independent local news possible in Vermont.
We hope your day brings connection, comfort and a moment of rest.
With gratitude,
The VTDigger team

Every week, two local newspapers close somewhere in the country. Some 50 million Americans have limited to no  access to local news. That may increase with loss of public media funding. 
What is the future of journalism in an age where truth itself is under attack? 
Local news is essential because “that’s where rebuilding confidence in facts and truth starts,” said VTDigger editor in chief Geeta Anand. We spoke at a public event at the Manchester Community Library on Nov. 11. 
“If you’ve actually gone to a meeting and seen a story based on it and met the reporter and it actually seems the article matches what you heard, then you begin to disbelieve the discrediting of journalism that is happening, led by the leaders of our country, which is having a devastating effect on our democracy.”
Anand’s career as a journalist and author spans the globe. Her stories on corporate corruption in the Wall Street Journal earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2002, and she was a finalist again in 2003. Her book, “The Cure,” about a father’s fight to save his kids by starting a company to make a medicine for their untreatable illness, was made into the 2010 movie, Extraordinary Measures, starring Harrison Ford. She was a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in India. 
Anand’s roots in journalism are in covering local news. She worked at Cape Cod News and then covered local government and courts at the Rutland Herald. In 2018, she became a professor at the UC Berkeley journalism school, where she was dean in 2020. She was at Berkeley until taking over leadership of VTDigger in July 2025. 
Anand spoke about how local journalism is a critical link in the information ecosystem. “Our coverage right now of immigrants getting picked up and spirited off to other parts of the country — that’s the way the world finds out that these things are happening. Our stories get picked up by national media, and the national media hold our national leaders accountable. We matter to you here in Vermont, but we’re also a key part of the web of national and international news.”
Anand said that for community and democracy to function, it is critical to support local news. “If we aren’t vibrant, if we’re not there at the city council meeting or at the school board meeting and telling those stories, government isn’t held accountable. It’s almost like these things haven’t happened if we’re not there.”

(U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Center photo)After the remnants of Typhoon Halong devastated communities in Western Alaska last month, you might have been jolted into remembering that forces beyond our immediate control govern the planet. A combination of wind, gravity, planetary rotation and uneven heating of the Earth’s surface can result in destructive storms and, in worst-case scenarios, a tragic loss of life.
While we’re right to be gravely concerned about climate change in Alaska, we can also appreciate that the powerful natural phenomena operating around us are often simply doing the quiet work of keeping our ecosystems humming — by transporting water, nutrients and atmospheric gases from place to place. The result is a bountiful suite of ecosystem services: fish and game that fill our freezers, vibrant landscapes for recreation and spiritual renewal, foundations for Indigenous culture and the economic engines of fishing and tourism. 
In Southeast Alaska, a coastal temperate rainforest flourishes with help from natural phenomena such as warm ocean currents, mid-latitude wind patterns and mountains. Though the combined effects are easy to see — towering trees and waters brimming with seafood — their machinations often appear invisible to the human eye, operating on scales too vast or microscopic to detect… until we look deeper to find what’s hiding in plain sight. Consider the following:
Tectonic motion. Over millions of years, tectonic motion — the shifting of the Earth’s crust — has helped shape a mosaic of aquatic habitats in Southeast Alaska. Picture rivers and streams gushing down mountainsides or meandering lazily across valley floors. Five species of salmon thrive in this mosaic today, with populations often genetically tuned to their particular habitat. Genetic diversity among salmon populations means higher species survival rates in a changing climate.
Glacial ablation. It’s no secret that glaciers in many parts of Alaska are melting. Glacial melt, also called ablation, is a culprit behind dangerous outburst floods and global sea-level rise. But there can be a flipside. In the transboundary Taku River watershed, for example, ablation is driving a massive ecosystem transformation with new salmon-accessible habitat emerging in pro-glacial streams. Scientists believe these waterways could begin housing Pacific salmon in as little as 15 years. As salmon habitat shrinks in other watersheds on the West Coast, glacial ablation in many Southeast Alaska ecosystems is expanding it.
Big tides. The Stikine River Delta is a major Pacific Flyway stopover for migrating shorebirds, possibly due to nutrient-rich biofilm on its mudflats. These oozing banks are expansive due to big tides that lay bare a spacious coastal table and invite famished birds to gather. While data shows that shorebirds are imperiled by habitat destruction elsewhere, they still find refuge in the Stikine where high-quality food and migratory habitat are on offer when ocean margins vanish into the distance.
Variable light conditions. Are you a seafood lover? If so, thank a rainforest cloud. In Southeast Alaska, coastal waters are often in flux when it comes to the availability of sunlight, and that could be helping fish build necessary fat stores. Research shows that variable light conditions, which can affect photosynthesis in addition to water temperature, salinity and, most crucially, nutrient levels, might be an on-switch for the production of essential fatty acids in diatoms, jumpstarting a food web that supports salmon, black cod and other species rich in omega-3 oils.  
Hydrogen bonds. The Southeast rainforest is full of water — in obvious places like rivers and streams, but also in less obvious ones such as soil and vegetation. Due to hydrogen bonds, water can absorb large amounts of energy with only a small temperature increase. The result is a sweeping heat sink that cools the surrounding environment, especially when massive conifers undergo the daily process of evapotranspiration which pulls moisture vertically through the landscape. Requiring no electrical outlets or utility bills, this natural air conditioning system is provided free of charge.
In Southeast Alaska, a host of natural phenomena keep the ecosystem — and its human communities — humming. People do their part for the ecosystem, in turn. Indigenous citizens bring traditional knowledge to natural resource management, like that of Pacific herring. Other problem-solvers work to ensure cruise-ship tourism is more sustainable by promoting a switch from heavy fuel oil to cleaner marine gas oil. 
Want to do your part, wherever your ecosystem may be? Start by simply seeing the world you inhabit a little differently. Whether it’s a receding tide, a mercurial cloud or the tremblor beneath your feet, the powers around you are invisible only until you take a closer look.

The Minnesota Society of Professional Journalists condemned law enforcement attacks on journalists during Tuesday federal operation in St. Paul.
Federal authorities took a person into custody in St. Paul in the 600 block of Rose Avenue East, Sahan Journal reported. A crowd of demonstrators showed up, as well as journalists to document the scene.
In a statement, SPJ said three photojournalists — all clearly identified as press with badges and/or vests and carrying their equipment — were hit by “less-lethal” munitions used by St. Paul police. One was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
St. Paul police used chemical irritants liberally, according many people at the scene and confirmed by photos.
Kerem Yücel, with MPR News, was hit in the shoulder and was transported to a hospital by ambulance; he was released and is recovering. Tim Evans, a freelance photojournalist with Reuters, was hit in the stomach with a pepper ball round. Aaron Nesheim, a photojournalist with Sahan Journal, was struck in the head with a pepper ball round. Evans and Nesheim did not require hospitalization.
The three journalists told SPJ that they believe they were targeted by law enforcement.

“Photojournalists are on the frontlines of documenting history and it is imperative that they are kept safe and their First Amendment rights are protected,” SPJ said in the statement.
SPJ said it is seeking answers from St. Paul city leadership.
St. Paul police Chief Axel Henry issued a statement on YouTube asserting that a “dangerous situation was unfolding” causing officers to engage.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Supreme Court Justice Daniel Crothers will retire from the bench on Feb. 28.
Crothers has served on the court since he was appointed by then-Gov. John Hoeven in 2005. He was then elected to an unfinished term in 2008, and 10-year terms in 2012 and 2022.
He announced his retirement in a Wednesday letter to Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Crothers’ letter does not state the reason for his retirement.
“Justice Crothers has faithfully served the citizens of North Dakota and applied the laws of our state with the utmost dedication, fairness and professionalism for over two decades,” Armstrong said in a Wednesday statement. “His respect for the litigants who appear before the Supreme Court, as well as the separate-but-equal roles of the executive and legislative branches of state government, have been a hallmark of his years on the bench. ”
While justices are ordinarily elected, vacancies are filled by appointment of the governor.
Armstrong will soon convene a committee to put together a list of candidates for appointment, according to the Governor’s Office.
2 seek position of North Dakota Supreme Court chief justice

The members of the nominating committee include Justice Jerod Tufte, Eric Lahlum, Taylor Olson, Laura Mihalik, Paul Forster, Toby Kommer and non-voting member Tony Weiler, executive director of the North Dakota Bar Association.
Once the list is received, the governor can either choose someone to appoint, reject the list and ask the committee to reconvene or call for a special election to fill the seat.
Before joining the Supreme Court, Crothers served as an assistant state’s attorney for Walsh County and worked in private practice. He chairs North Dakota’s Committee on Judiciary Standards.
Crothers’ retirement comes after Chief Justice Jon Jensen announced he would step down as head of the court. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Tufte are running to succeed him in the role. Jensen will remain a justice.

Source: Screenshot/DeSantis FacebookNearly two months after calling for the elimination of vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, the DeSantis administration announced it will hold a three-hour public meeting in Northwest Florida for the public to weigh in.
The Department of Health has scheduled the meeting in Panama City Beach on Dec. 12 to discuss changes to  the existing rule regarding vaccine requirements for public and private schools, from preschool through grade 12 as well as adult education classes.
While the DOH announced a meeting date and time it did not release a draft of any of its proposed changes.
Health care attorney and lobbyist Chris Nuland predicted the meeting will be well attended.
“Despite the state putting the notice for a workshop in the most remote corner of the state, there will be several doctors who will be attending that workshop to argue for the existing rule,” said Nuland, a Jacksonville lobbyist whose clients include the Florida Chapter of the American College of Physicians Services; the Florida Chapter, American College of Surgeons; and the Florida Neurosurgical Society, among others.
Students who attend public and private schools are required by Florida law to be vaccinated for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus. The statute allows the DOH through rule to require additional vaccinations, which it does.

DOH’s rule allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced in September their desire to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, although their focus, for now, appears to be school-aged children.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Ladapo, a  long time vaccine skeptic, likened vaccine requirements to slavery and told those attending the press conference that the government lacks authority to require vaccinations.
“It’s wrong, it’s immoral,” he said at the time. “They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
The announcement made national headlines and was immediately blasted by top Democrats. Even some Republicans have distanced themselves from the idea.
The 2026 regular session begins Tuesday, Jan. 13. To date, the DeSantis administration hasn’t floated its legislative proposal to eliminate all vaccines from statutes.
Meanwhile, Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith is pushing a proposal (SB 626) to amend statutes to include hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal disease in the list of required vaccines in statutes.

Jeff Landry's administration plans to reopen the Jetson Center for Youth in Baker (pictured above) in April. The juvenile justice facility was shut down over a decade ago. (Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana officials plan to reopen a youth prison in April that was shuttered over a decade ago when it was declared inappropriate for young people. 
The state Office of Juvenile Justice plans to move 36 incarcerated youth to the old Jetson Center for Youth in Baker after some minor upgrades to buildings on the site. The interim facility is expected to help with overcrowding in the state’s youth prison system, agency undersecretary Jason Starnes said. 
“We desperately need some relief with our bed capacity issues,” Starnes told state lawmakers at a budget hearing last week. 

The long-term plan for the Jetson site is to replace the existing facility with a brand new youth prison complex that will house up to 72 children and teenagers. It is expected to cost close to $70 million and would open during the 2027-28 state budget year. 

In the meantime, the state will renovate existing buildings at Jetson to accommodate a dormitory, cafeteria, laundry facility and classrooms for the 36 youth who will arrive in the spring.

The money to make those buildings inhabitable will come from the budget for the new Jetson construction, said Matt Baker, director of the state Office of Planning and Facility Control, at the budget hearing. He did not say how much will be spent on the rehabilitation. 
“We’re going to do some cleaning up,” Baker said. “But essentially, we are doing as efficient of a renovation as possible so we can retain as much budget as we can for the new facility.”
Once the new building is opened, the state plans to tear down all the existing facilities on Jetson’s campus, Baker said.

When Jetson was closed in 2014, Gov. Bobby Jindal’s staff described it as old and obsolete. Some Jetson buildings had first opened in 1948 and were not conducive to the therapeutic setting the juvenile justice system was trying to embrace at the time. 

State officials also justified Jetson’s closure by saying it was difficult to secure because its campus is large and buildings are spread out over several acres. 
More recently, Louisiana used Jetson as its temporary women’s prison for nine years. The state hastily moved its incarcerated women to Jetson in 2016 after the women’s prison in St. Gabriel flooded and became unlivable. They were moved out of Jetson earlier this year when a new women’s prison opened at another St. Gabriel site. 

Advocates for incarcerated women complained about the condition of Jetson while the women were housed there, but juvenile justice officials say they intend to use a different building. 
Still, Starnes admitted most of the facilities at Jetson are in bad physical shape. 
“A lot of the facilities are very aged. [The buildings] are in very poor condition,” he said last week. 

Legislators are also concerned about the impact to the surrounding communities. When Jetson was open, breakouts happened frequently and surrounding neighbors experienced waves of crime from the facility. At the time, the facility housed hundreds of incarcerated youth. 
State Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, said she is concerned about new residential developments that under construction near the Jetson site.

(Photo via Getty Images)The worst part of the information age is not everyone having access to everything going on in the world. It’s that everyone feels like they have to have an opinion on it all.
It’s as if the constant barrage of insane news flying at our faces 24/7 is making us all feel like we have an obligation to be keyed in to everything going on in the world. Of course, being informed is important, but so is having normal conversations about normal human things that don’t involve debating the fundamentals of humanity.
Thanksgiving is uniquely primed for those types of nausea-inducing conversations, and you might be prepping how you’re going to redirect your racist uncle right alongside the turkey.
I am proposing, instead, 24 topics of conversation that will be much more fun to discuss, reveal new and interesting depths to the relatives you see twice a year, and (hopefully) ensure no one will leave the dinner table crying and blocking everyone on Facebook.

Greet everyone with an uncomfortably long hug, like, it’s really weird that you’re hugging them for so long, why are you doing that, please let go, and see who the first person is to ask if you’re doing okay.
Share a small moment from your life that delighted you recently.
If you were a Thanksgiving dish, which would you be and why?
Do you think this life is the first time you’ve been on Earth?
Which sibling will be the best at taking care of Mom and Dad when they start to turn senile?
Say three nice things about Mom (or whoever took the lead in planning Thanksgiving, which, let’s be honest, is likely a mom).
What’s the best new song you listened to recently?
Which NFL position do you think you could play?
Which of your grandparents would you be least surprised to learn had an affair in 1972?
Reveal one bad thing you did in high school that your parents never figured out (those under 18 in attendance are excused from participating).
How was NASCAR almost as big of a sport in America as the NFL in the late 90s and early 2000s and what would it take for them to reach that level of popularity again? (This is a specific request from my husband and also a test to see if he reads my stuff)
If the entire family was stranded on an island, who would be sacrificed for food first?
Share one thing you’re thankful for.
Share one thing you’re not thankful for.
Share your most embarrassing moment from elementary school.
Do you think aliens have pets?
What’s the most evil thing one of your siblings did to you when you were children?
What are the top 5 best Christmas movies?
If you had to choose a different woman in your family to be your mom, who would you choose?
Which cousin’s ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend was your least favorite and why?
What’s your favorite book you’ve ever read?
Set a timer for five minutes and everyone make a sincere attempt at writing a poem. Then share all poems, slam-style, and the winner gets first choice of leftovers to take home.
Which family member would you call as a lifeline if you were a contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
Share the funniest moment you can remember of a family member crying and/or fighting with someone else on a holiday.

A jury convicted Lunsford in February, but a judge called for a new trial in October. (File photo /Source NM)As a former Las Cruces police officer previously convicted for killing a Black man accused of stealing a beer awaits a possible new trial, his ankle monitor will remain on.
In 2022, Las Cruces Police Officer Brad Lunsford responded to a 911 call that alleged someone had stolen a beer from a gas station convenience store. Lunsford attempted to arrest 36-year-old Presley Eze as bystanders filmed the interaction with their cellphones. Lunsford, who had been involved in prior police shootings, alleged that Eze grabbed his Taser during the struggle. Lunsford drew his service weapon and shot Eze once in the back of the head.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez first filed criminal charges against Lunsford in late 2023. The filing marked the first time in nearly a decade that a police officer anywhere in New Mexico had faced criminal charges for a fatal shooting — the most recent instance was the trial of Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, the Albuquerque officers who in 2014 killed James Boyd in the Sandia Foothills. Their case ended in a mistrial.
The Eze killing led Southern New Mexicans to be “rightly concerned about whether or not justice is equal in this country,” Torrez said when he announced the criminal charges in 2023.
A jury convicted Lunsford in February of this year.
In October, though, Sixth Judicial District Judge Jim Foy ordered a new trial, which has yet to be scheduled. Foy said he had inappropriately substituted two alternate jurors and dismissed two regular jurors before deliberations began because at the time the court was using a form that incorrectly listed which jurors were alternates. 
Foy also said that newly discovered evidence showed one juror held anti-cop bias. Upon his decision, the National Police Association went so far as to publish the headline, “Did an Anti-Police Activist Lie to Get on the Officer Brad Lunsford Jury?”
Torrez pushed back. His New Mexico Department of Justice in October appealed Foy’s decision to the state Court of Appeals and argued that the juror’s answers to pre-trial questionnaires, which included a disclosure about affiliation with the Southern Poverty Law Center, did not seem to alarm Lunsford’s attorneys at the start of his criminal trial. The juror’s academic works about race in early education and parenthood and podcast appearances are all easily accessible by a simple Google search of the juror’s name, lawyers with Torrez’s New Mexico Department of Justice argued.
Foy’s call for a new trial “set aside the jury’s finding of guilt (that) has devastated Presley Eze’s family and further undermines the public’s faith in New Mexico’s criminal justice system,” Torrez said in an October statement. “The presiding judge…has repeatedly mischaracterized the factual record, improperly weighed in on the strength of the state’s case and committed numerous procedural errors that prejudiced the prosecution.”
Torrez’s department filed its arguments in appeals court earlier this month. A decision remains pending.
On Nov. 21, Foy denied Lunsford’s request to modify the conditions of his release, which sought to remove his requirement to wear an ankle monitor and to post a $10,000 bond, pending the appellate court’s decision.
“Our goal in the new trial is to ensure Officer Lunsford receives a fair proceeding before an impartial jury that hears all of the evidence and correctly applies the law,” Lunsford’s attorney Matt Chandler wrote in an email to Source NM. “We remain confident that, in a fair trial, the evidence will show that Officer Lunsford’s actions were lawful, that he was protecting his own life and the life of his fellow officer from a violent, aggressive attack by the suspect, and that he should be acquitted.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot while on deployment in Washington D.C. on Wednesday, according to a statement from Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The condition of the two members was unknown as of 4:15 p.m.
Morrisey initially posted on social media at 3:33 p.m. that one of the victims was dead and another sent to the hospital following the shooting. He then announced at 3:42 p.m. that both members of the West Virginia National Guard were dead. 
In a third post at 4:04 p.m., however, Morrisey said he was receiving “conflicting reports” about the condition of the West Virginia National Guard members.
“… [The state] will provide additional updates once we receive more complete information,” Morrisey continued.
The shooting took place blocks from the White House. According to the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, the scene was secure and one suspect was in custody at 2:58 p.m.
President Donald Trump was in Florida on Wednesday but was briefed on the shooting, White House officials said. In social media posts, Trump said the perpetrator was an “animal” and was “also severely wounded” in the incident. Regardless, he continued, the shooter will “pay a very steep price.”
“God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement,” Trump said. “These are truly Great People. I, as President of the United States, and everyone associated with the Office of the Presidency, am with you!”
The shooting comes less than a week after a federal judge ruled that the deployment of National Guard troops from several states to Washington, D.C. at the request of Trump was illegal. The Trump administration was given until Dec. 11 to pull troops out or file an appeal to the ruling. 
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Citizen Action Group filed a lawsuit against Morrisey and the West Virginia National Guard regarding West Virginia troops being deployed to D.C. CAG was represented by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union.
The ACLU attorneys argued that the deployment by Morrisey was unlawful and an abuse of state powers that allow the governor to activate National Guard troops for matters outside of the state only under limited circumstances. They said the ongoing deployment was causing real and irreparable harm to people in West Virginia.
Attorneys for the state of West Virginia countered that CAG, the plaintiff, was not facing any real or clear harm from the deployment. The only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” due to the National Guard deployment, the state argued, are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Attorneys with the ACLU were asking the court for a temporary injunction that would have seen all West Virginia National Guard members deployed to D.C. sent home.
On Nov. 10, Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay sided with the state of West Virginia and dismissed the case, meaning troops remained in D.C.
This is a developing story and more will be reported as information becomes available.

Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) to send a letter to the conference’s commissioner stating her opposition to the deal and requesting additional information. 
Publicly reported details show the Big Ten would sell 10% of its media rights to UC Investments, a group affiliated with the University of California system pension fund, for $2.4 billion.

In her letter to the conference commissioner Tony Petitti, Stevens warned the deal would be a “dangerous expansion of private equity influence over our nation’s universities, harming the quality of college sports and the integrity of university governance.”
The influence of wealthy non-university interests has already created issues for college sports, Stevens said, pointing to the role of television networks in eliminating the regional nature of conferences through realignment.
The deal would open the door for other conferences to seek investment from private enquiry groups, Stevens said, arguing it would further undermine regional cohesion. She also warned that giving private investment firms control of sports television revenue would create undue influence over university decisionmaking.
Big Ten member universities should be focused on their mission to educate and prepare young people for fulfilling and productive lives instead of maximizing television revenue in partnership with wealthy financial institutions.
Stevens requested Petitti respond with an answer to the following questions by Dec. 12. Stevens asked if a conference media rights agreement is reached, how will the commissioner  ensure that UC Investments, or any subsequent private equity investor, will not impact the independence and internal governance of member universities? 
She also asked if a conference media rights agreement is reached, how will the commissioner ensure that efforts to promote large revenue-generating sports does not come at the expense of support for Title IX and non-revenue sports that have provided a path to college and meaningful experiences for generations of students? 
The representative further asked if an agreement is reached, how will the commissioner ensure confidence amongst athletes, students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the local communities of member universities that the profit seeking motives of UC Investments, and any subsequent private equity investors, are not superseding the overall public serving mission of Big Ten member universities?",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AMR1000-311-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)SIOUX FALLS — A prosecutor apologized this week for the state’s failure to preserve evidence in a case involving an overdose death in a state prison. 
The state of South Dakota wants to convict the inmate charged with providing the drugs, Manarion Fuse, of a crime that could keep him behind bars for the rest of his life.
Fuse is accused of giving drugs to Anthony Richards, who died of a drug overdose in February at the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. Fuse, who appeared in court via video link on Tuesday, maintains his innocence.
During the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Ryan McFall told Minnehaha County Judge Jon Sogn that the state never measured the quantity of the drug present in Richards’ system before it concluded that he’d died by overdosing on it.
The prosecutor also admitted, with an apology to the judge, that it no longer has videos of the visits where Fuse was allegedly given the drugs he was later indicted for distributing inside the prison.
“It was supposed to have been preserved,” McFall said of the video evidence, adding, “There is not a good answer as to why it was not.”
Case the first of several tied to ‘K2’
Fuse’s case is among several tied to an uptick in the circulation of synthetic drugs, referred to colloquially as “K2,” inside South Dakota’s prisons.
Overdose deaths, gang violence draw charges in some — not all — recent prison incidents

Seven people are believed to have died of overdoses this year in the state’s custody. K2 is suspected or confirmed as a cause of death in at least five of them, starting with Richards, who died on Feb. 6 at the age of 20.
Fuse, 22, went to prison last year for the unlawful discharge of a firearm. He’s serving a 10-year sentence, with three years suspended. Given his prior convictions, he could be sentenced to life if he’s found guilty of distributing a substance resulting in death.
Questions key to Fuse’s defense involve the drug’s concentration in Richards’ body, the source of the K2 involved, and Fuse’s contention that the drugs came from other inmates or Department of Corrections staff members.
Fuse’s court-appointed attorney, Minnehaha County Deputy Public Defender Kylie Beck, said Tuesday that her client “is adamant that he is not the person who provided the drugs” that killed Richards.
Video visits
The state has alleged that family and friends gave Fuse the K2 during visits, Beck told the judge.
Beck said she expected the state to be able to prove as much with videos of those visits, which she’s asked to review. In response, McFall said he also expected the videos to be preserved, but that there’s little he can do about it now.
“They do not exist at this time, and cannot be provided,” he said.
The Department of Corrections did not respond to a South Dakota Searchlight request for comment on the videos.
On the issue of testing for the amount of K2 in Richards’ system, Beck said the reports she received indicate only that the drug was present.
“I believe quantity is critical if the allegation involves an overdose in which a person was killed,” Beck said.
McFall said no such “quantitative” tests were performed at the time of Richards’ autopsy, repeating a line he’d use several times during the half-hour hearing:
“We’ve turned over what we have.”
Inmate points finger at staff
Beck has twice requested reports about six current or former state employees who worked inside the prison “regarding their possible involvement and/or knowledge” of the drug distribution tied to Richards’ death. 
Beck was given reports showing that those staff members responded to the Richards overdose, but said Tuesday she was looking for reports that might support her client’s contention that they were known to be “dirty” staff.

At least one of the staff members no longer works for the state, according to South Dakota Searchlight reviews of the state’s salary database.
McFall said the state had provided all the incident-related reports that mention the staff members. He’s not aware of any reports accusing the staff of drug-related misbehavior, and said he’s “not aware of any authority” that would grant Fuse access to any reports on those staffers beyond those created in relation to Richards’ death.
But, he added, “to my knowledge at this time, no reports investigating those individuals exist.”
Judge Sogn told Beck there’s no way he can order the release of reports that don’t exist, but said the state must produce them if they emerge.
Phone calls, inmate safety checks
Beck also wanted to know the dates attached to “about 20” recorded phone calls placed by other inmates on Fuse’s unit in the run-up to Richards’ death.
Beck said she needs to know the dates to determine if any talk about drugs captured on those calls can offer insight on the source of the drugs circulating at the time.
High prison death toll continues after 33-year-old man found unresponsive in cell

McFall said the dates were not part of a “bevy of answers” delivered in October from the state. At this point, he said, the case’s lead investigator is out on maternity leave and might not be able to help for a few weeks.
Judge Sogn told McFall the information ought to come earlier than that.
“There has to be at least one person at the penitentiary” who can provide the dates and times for the calls, Sogn said.
The judge also told McFall to seek out more details about the cell checks performed on the day of Richards’ death. Thus far, Beck said, she’s received information on how often cells ought to be checked, but no records to show that those checks took place — or didn’t — on the day Richards died. 
The judge gave the state until mid-December to deliver the remainder of deliverable evidence to Fuse’s attorney. The case is scheduled for trial on the week of Jan. 26.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4256-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)The preliminary injunction against the state’s social media ban on minors won’t last, an appeals court concluded this week. 
Two judges on a three-judge panel told the state Tuesday it may begin enforcing a 2024 law that prohibits young Floridians from using social media while litigation plays out. 
“HB3 is now the law of the state and will be enforced. We’re putting all big tech companies on notice: endanger our kids and find out what happens!” Uthmeier posted to his personal X account Tuesday, posting on his official account that his office “will aggressively enforce this law.”
In June, a federal district court judge granted a preliminary injunction against enforcing the law. It had previously denied a request for preliminary injunction before the social media giants amended their complaint. 
Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit halted the preliminary injunction. 
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (via Department of Legal Affairs)
“Another win on appeal, this time upholding Florida’s protections for kids against predatory social media companies. We put parents and kids first!” Gov. Ron DeSantis posted to his personal X account. 
The law, a focus of former House Speaker and now candidate for governor Paul Renner, passed in 2024 and prohibits Floridians younger than 14 from having social media accounts on platforms that deploy “addictive features.” The law, which scored bipartisan support, also requires parental consent for youngsters age 14 and 15 to have accounts on those same platforms.
The circuit court majority, comprising Judges Elizabeth Branch and Barbara Lagoa, both Donald Trump appointees, said the attorney general has made a “strong showing of a likelihood of success.” 
Largely an argument of First Amendment infringement, the majority opinion and and a dissent written by Judge Robin Rosenbaum, a President Barack Obama appointee, conflict on whether the law should fall under strict or intermediate First Amendment scrutiny. 
The state has argued that the law does not prohibit the use of social media, instead just apps that use addictive features like “infinite scrolling,” push notifications or alerts, “personal interactive metrics” regarding likes or shares, “auto-play video,” and “live-streaming.” The circuit majority agreed, conflicting with the district court ruling. 
Platforms, upon notification from a minor’s parent, must terminate a minor’s account, the law requires.
The suit was filed by NetChoice and Computer and Communications Industry Association.  Proceedings will continue over the merits of the law itself.
NetChoice represents Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, YouTube, Pinterest, Google, and other tech giants. CCIA also represents Facebook and Instagram, Google, Pinterest, and others.
“NetChoice is disappointed in the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling allowing Florida’s censorship law to take effect while Florida continues to appeal our injunction. Briefing has finished, and we look forward to the opportunity to explain the law’s constitutional problems to the Court directly,” Paul Taske of NetChoice said in an online statement. 
“We will consider all available options to ensure Floridians’ online communication is safe and free. Florida’s censorship regime not only violates its citizens’ free speech rights but also makes all users — especially minors — less safe.”
The majority wrote that the law is “likely content neutral” and satisfies the intermediate scrutiny test. 
“The Attorney General is likely to show that the legislature chose the regulation it did, not because it is easier than alternatives, but because it is the most effective way of achieving its interest,” Branch wrote. 
“It is unlikely that HB3 inappropriately curtails any First Amendment rights. And the compliance costs plaintiffs might incur do not outweigh the State’s interest in enforcing its lawful regulation,” Branch wrote.

Dissent
In a lengthy dissent, Rosenbaum said the law is “plainly unconstitutional under the First Amendment. In fact, it’s plainly unconstitutional on its face.”
Rosenbaum finds it to be content-based, which would put it under strict scrutiny as opposed to intermediate scrutiny. The absence of  streaming services like Hulu and Disney+ in the lawsuit but the inclusion of other social media platforms signal that the law is content-based, Rosenbaum wrote. 
“The Act directly regulates expression in at least two ways. First, the Act inserts the state of Florida into users’ decisions about whether and how to speak online,” Rosenbaum wrote. Second, is that the law “interferes with the platforms’ editorial choices about which users can join the platform and about what content to display to those users.”
Rosenbaum points to the majority classifying age verification as imposing a “modest” burden on adult speech when it requires providing personally identifiable information.
“And to be sure, for adult users who seek to engage in online speech that Florida state officials and their political allies would approve of, the burden may be ‘modest.’ But for everyone else — especially those who wish to express dissatisfaction with Florida politics and officials — the Act’s disclosure requirements impose a heavy burden.” Rosenbaum wrote.
Rosenbaum invoked the parental empowerment movement in contesting the law.
“We should be wary of governments supplanting parents in deciding which ideas children should and should not be exposed to,” Rosenbaum wrote.

National Guard were on high visibility patrols in the area of 17th and I Street Northwest when a suspect came around the corner, raised his arm with a firearm and discharged at the National Guard members,” MPD Executive Assistant Chief Jeffery Carroll said. “There were other (National Guard) members that were in the area. They were able to, after some back and forth … subdue the individual and bring them into custody,” Carroll added. “Within moments, members of law enforcement in the area were also able to assist and bring that individual into custody.”Carroll said there were no other suspects at the time of the press conference, in the early evening, and that law enforcement officials had reviewed video footage from the area where the shooting took place. “It appears, like I said, to be a lone gunman that raised the firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard, and he was quickly taken into custody by other National Guard members and law enforcement members,” he said. The guardsmen were armed, but Carroll said investigators had not yet determined if they shot back or how the suspect, whom he did not name, was shot. “At this point, we're still investigating exactly who shot the individual. It's not clear at this time,” he said. Officials were also not yet sure “what kind of weapon” the suspect used during the shooting, which Carroll said “happened right in front of the Metro, although there is no indication that the perpetrator was on the Metro.” The Metro is the district’s public transit system.Bowser reiterated during the press conference that the two National Guard members were in critical condition and referred to the shooting as “targeted.”

Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas, questions the process of selecting a company to implement a $10 million gun-detection program in public schools. The initiative began as a 2024 request by a Pennsylvania technology company for an exclusive service contract in Kansas. In this image from April 10, 2025, Pettey offers remarks in the Kansas Senate. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s special budget committee revealed the attorney general’s office continues to work toward awarding a $10 million contract to a private vendor for deployment of artificial intelligence and use of security cameras to spot gun-wielding intruders in public schools.
Gov. Laura Kelly signed a budget bill in April that included funding for technology that promised to identify unconcealed firearms in school buildings so alerts could be forwarded to school staff and law enforcement officers. In October, three companies submitted bids through the Kansas Department of Administration. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Kris Kobach said a contract hadn’t been issued.
Under state law, the attorney general’s office was directed to make certain the system was installed in schools by the end of December and operational at the close of February.
Sen. Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas, said the initiative was embraced by the Legislature at the same time a popular program offering state-funded school-security grants to districts was dropped.
“We no longer have funding in the Department of Education for safe and secure schools,” Pettey said. “But we do have this funding source … but nothing has been appropriated? Schools would like to have safe and secure funds, but they don’t have any option now except through this program.”
Bids on the Kansas firearm-identification contract were submitted by Gades Sales Co. of Wichita; CIS Data Services of Springfield, Missouri; and ZeroEyes of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. Financial details of those company proposals haven’t been made public.
The idea of relying on AI to pinpoint unconcealed weapons in schools and possibly thwart mass shootings has been debated in Kansas since ZeroEyes hired lobbyists last year to convince legislators to award it the contract to operate an enhanced security system for benefit of Kansas schools.
Lobbyists for ZeroEyes pitched the idea of directly earmarking state funding to ZeroEyes or establishing contract provisions matching ZeroEyes’ marketing materials so rival venders would have difficulty landing the contract.
Kieran Carroll, chief strategy officer for ZeroEyes, told a Kansas House committee in February 2024 that covering 1,300 school buildings in Kansas with ZeroEyes’ technology and delivering 24-hour monitoring of two dozen cameras in each school would cost the state $8.5 million annually.
In May 2024, Gov. Laura Kelly used line-item authority to veto the budget measure dedicating $5 million to a gun-identification initiative that favored ZeroEyes. The bill limited dollar-for-dollar matches from the state to school districts that signed up with ZeroEyes.
The governor said the result would have been “a no-bid contract” that wrote ZeroEyes’ technology into state law without proper consideration of alternative companies.
The Republican-led Legislature responded during the 2025 session by authorizing expenditure of $10 million for a firearm-detection program available to all Kansas public school districts. This version of the AI funding plan wasn’t vetoed by Kelly and led to the ongoing contract bidding process.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100560-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted Tuesday to begin verifying voters’ citizenship status, as federal officials pursue a similar national plan.
The board voted to partner with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and share the state’s voter rolls with the federal government’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements or SAVE database. According to DHS, the database was created to help states check for eligibility for benefit programs, but some states are using it to verify voter citizenship as well.
“This is one of the few tools available to us to check for noncitizens on our voter rolls,” executive director Sam Hayes, a Republican, said in a news release Wednesday. “We are pleased to follow the letter of the law outlined in North Carolina’s Constitution and to make clear that elections are reserved for U.S. citizens.”
Under state law, the state board would send reports on residents’ voter registration and citizenship status to county boards of elections. Counties would then be required to notify voters by mail within a month and, if they do not object, remove them from the voter rolls.
County boards will be required to flag any noncitizens removed from the voter rolls within the state database.
Critics of the SAVE database have warned of possible mismatches and incorrect information in it, as well as other hiccups that could lead to people being improperly removed from voter rolls.
The decision from North Carolina’s board comes as the Trump administration seeks to construct its own verification program. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking access to an obscure computer database used by law enforcement officials, while also demanding that states share copies of their voter files with personal data, Stateline has reported.
But the national plan has garnered fierce opposition among civil rights advocates who argue that it would effectively create a national source of personal information on American voters.
North Carolina’s voter rolls already undergo cross-checking as officials remove voters who move out of the state or die. But Republicans, who recently took a majority on the state board, have pushed for further scrutiny and regulation, specifically on citizenship status.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Black-voters-Getty-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) introduced a bill Monday to transfer the comptroller office’s investigative and subpoena powers to the State Commission of Investigation, and the bill is scheduled to be heard by a legislative committee Monday morning in Trenton. Walsh told reporters Wednesday the measure is designed to keep the public and Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill from “continuing to go after corruption in our state.”
“It is designed to undermine an extraordinarily effective watchdog agency. It is designed to reduce the power of the governor to address corruption, especially at the local level. It is designed to shut down ongoing investigations we are involved in,” he said.
Tensions grow between state watchdog and the pols under his scrutiny

The State Commission of Investigation already has investigative and subpoena powers, Walsh added.
“So that just shows, really, what a scam the entire concept of the bill is,” he said.
Walsh’s investigations into public fraud, waste, and abuse have tormented officials at all levels in New Jersey, driving critics to demand that state lawmakers muzzle a watchdog that reformers revere as one of New Jersey’s most effective guardians against government misconduct.
Critics’ demands for a comptroller crackdown started early last year, Walsh said. He finds that timing notable.
In December 2023, he issued a report that rebuked public payments made to several Scutari associates, including Edward Oatman, who was Scutari’s chief of staff before he was appointed Union County manager in 2018.
Walsh’s investigators found that Union County improperly paid several top officials, including Oatman, more than $400,000 in stipends and tuition reimbursements. Walsh recommended that the county work to recover the improperly paid funds, institute a corrective action plan, and be more transparent in such payments. Instead, state lawmakers moved to loosen compensation rules for county officials, although that legislation subsequently stalled.
“There is a discomfort that comes with being the subject of a report where you’re called out for doing something wrong. But our democracy is supposed to be strong enough to handle that sort of truth,” Walsh said. “I can’t speak to Sen. Scutari’s motivations in particular based on that report, but the timing is noteworthy.”
Oatman did not respond to a request for comment.
Scutari’s bill also would put legislators in charge of appointing the chair of the State Commission of Investigations, more than double the part-time commissioners’ salaries, and give the commission’s chair the authority to seek a wiretap in cases involving misconduct by state Department of Law and Public Safety employees. That department houses the state police and the Attorney General’s Office.
Walsh pushed back on all of those provisions. He called the pay hikes wasteful and said shifting appointment authority for the commission’s chair to the Legislature would politicize an oversight agency whose independence should be fiercely protected. Right now, the governor names the commission’s chair.
“We don’t do wiretapping right now. That’s a law-enforcement power, and this would seemingly, with little or no checks, grant SCI that power,” he said.










It is designed to undermine an extraordinarily effective watchdog agency.


– Acting comptroller Kevin Walsh


Scutari, who is the highest-ranking state legislator as Senate president, did not respond to a request for comment.
His bill says it aims to eliminate “overlap” in the two watchdogs’ missions and that the comptroller’s “core work … will continue unabated.”
Walsh disputed those claims too, saying the agencies have had no conflicts because they “generally try to stay out of each other’s way.”
He added: “Our core powers right now include the power to investigate public corruption.”
The office gets hundreds of tips of public corruption and waste a month, Walsh said. He cited multiple examples of major investigations his office has done that would have been impossible without investigative and subpoena powers, including exposing a police training firm’s controversial teachings, oversight lapses that led Essex County to pay millions to ghost employees carrying out its pandemic vaccination work, and the misuse of opioid settlement fund spending in Irvington.
Besides investigations, the office, which has about 130 employees, also audits public agencies, reviews public contracts, and oversees the Medicaid program. The comptroller’s office would continue that work under Scutari’s bill.
The bill is set to be heard at 10 a.m. Monday before the Senate’s state government committee at the Statehouse in Trenton. Advocates from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey plan to join Walsh in testifying against it.
“It does a lot of damage in a moment where there is heightened distrust of government. We need more watchdogs, not fewer,” said Amol Sinha, the group’s executive director. “The idea that there is too much oversight in New Jersey is just false and disregards what people want to see, which is politics and governance that are uncorrupted.”
The police accountability work Walsh’s office does, alone, is reason why policymakers should preserve its investigative and subpoena powers, Sinha added. Walsh’s office has investigated police traffic enforcement and racial profiling, the police practice of “courtesy cards,” and lapses in public reporting of police misconduct, among other things.
“Since we cannot rely on the federal government to engage in consent decrees or pattern and practice investigations the way they once used to, we need all of the support that we can get at the state level to conduct that oversight, and it’s all the more important that we have an effective Office of the State Comptroller that can hold state police accountable,” Sinha said.
The feds have dropped oversight of and investigations into several troubled New Jersey police departments recently, including Newark and Trenton.
Walsh is almost six years into his term, but doesn’t expect he’ll serve much past Jan. 20, when Sherrill takes over from Gov. Phil Murphy. New governors typically install their own people.
But he said he’ll fight hard against Scutari’s bill anyway to protect both the comptroller office’s in-progress probes and its mission of protecting public integrity and taxpayer money.
“I’m thinking of this both as impacting the ongoing investigations that have started under my leadership, and additionally impacting whoever leads the office, prospectively,” he said.
He said he hasn’t spoken with Sherrill, Murphy, or the commission’s leaders about Scutari’s bill, but added it would be “pretty extraordinary” if Murphy signed it. Tyler Jones, a Murphy spokeswoman, declined to comment.
“No governor should permit what is occurring here, which would be hamstringing, undermining, the executive branch from policing itself,” Walsh said. “We all have an obligation to protect the important institutions of our government.”

Zachary Simonson is suing the City of Ottumwa in U.S. District Court, alleging violations of his rights as a veteran and a whistleblower.
Court records indicate Simonson was hired by the city in 2017 as a seasonal housing inspector and eventually worked as a building inspector and planner before being named director of community development in May 2021.

The lawsuit claims that beginning in January 2024, City Administrator Phil Rath and Human Resources Director Barb Codjoe began making disparaging remarks about a particular council member during weekly department head meetings.
Rath, the lawsuit claims, speculated that the council member had dementia or some other impairment, and Codjoe questioned whether the council member could complete his term of office. Simonson claims he was disturbed by the remarks and attempted to redirect discussions toward proactive engagement with the council.
In late 2024, the city conducted an internal investigation into an anonymous complaint allegedly filed against Simonson but did not inform him of the nature of that investigation.
According to the lawsuit, on Dec. 19, 2024, Simonson filed a formal complaint with the city, alleging the city’s finance director had brought a bottle of Crown Royal Canadian whisky to a city meeting in violation of the city’s zero-tolerance policy on alcohol. Days later, the city allegedly placed Simonson on a performance improvement plan.
In February 2025, Simonson informed Rath that he planned to notify the Ottumwa City Council he was a finalist for the Oskaloosa city manager position while informing the council he was unhappy about the performance improvement plan and an allegedly hostile work environment.
The lawsuit alleges Rath urged Simonson not to reference the performance improvement plan, but Simonson did so anyway.
In March 2025, Simonson was still working for the City of Ottumwa — the City of Oskaloosa had hired another individual as its city manager — when, the lawsuit claims, he spoke to Landfill Supervisor Lori Creech regarding the landfill being closed without his authorization. In his lawsuit, Simonson alleges he spoke to Creech in a professional and respectful manner, but Creech later claimed he was “screaming and rude” to her.
The city then fired Simonson, alleging gross misconduct related to the conversation with Creech.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of the Iowa Veterans’ Preference Act, violations of Simonson’s due process rights and First Amendment rights, and retaliation for whistleblowing.
The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and a trial date has yet to be scheduled.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced the arrests of two Virginia brothers accused of plotting violent attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — a case that immediately drew national attention amid the ongoing immigration crackdown and heightened threats against federal law enforcement.
John Wilson Bennett and his brother, Mark Booth Bennett, both U.S. citizens, were taken into custody last week. 
According to DHS, the investigation began Nov. 17 after an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the men discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents.” Authorities say Mark Bennett also talked about meeting “likeminded individuals” in Las Vegas to buy firearms equipped with explosive rounds.
Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at Norfolk International Airport before boarding a flight to Charlotte en route to Las Vegas. That same day, federal agents arrested John Bennett in Virginia Beach, where he has worked as assistant principal at Kempsville High School since 2009.
Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin emphasized the severity of the allegations, noting that a school administrator is among the accused. 
“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” McLaughlin said. She credited Homeland Security Investigations and local police for quickly intervening.
DHS highlighted what it described as a sharp rise in violence targeting ICE employees, pointing to internal figures showing “a more than 1,150% increase in assaults” and an “8,000% increase in death threats” in recent years. 
McLaughlin said officers have faced bounties placed on their heads, threats to their families, stalking and doxxing.
Federal authorities did not say whether the brothers were connected to any organized extremist group. Both men were charged under Virginia law with conspiracy to commit malicious wounding. Court dates have not yet been set.
The case echoes other recent incidents in which immigration authorities have been targeted. 
On July 4, authorities say a group of suspects launched a coordinated attack on the Prairieland ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Tx., using fireworks as a diversion before opening fire on responding officers; the FBI later arrested 10 of 11 alleged participants, who now face local terrorism charges, according to ICE and federal court documents.
More broadly, judges and federal agents have reported increased online threats tied to political grievances, according to data and analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice and its research partners.
DHS did not release possible motives in the most recent case, and court filings have not yet been made public. The agency said only that the Virginia Beach Police Department and local law enforcement assisted in the investigation and arrests.

Content warning: This story contains graphic depictions of violence.
Tuesday, Nov. 11, should have been an ordinary workday for 20-year-old Amber Czech, who worked as a welder at a manufacturing facility in Cokato, Minnesota.
She loved her craft and taught welding at her old high school on days she had off. But she was also a rarity. Women make up just 6% of welders in the country, and, as with other male-dominated occupations, it came with the risk of isolation and bullying.
It was a reality of the job that for Czech turned deadly. While she was at her work station that day, a man she worked with walked over to her, picked up a sledgehammer and bludgeoned her to death. He later told law enforcement he simply did not like her and had been planning to murder her for some time.
As the news spread across social media, stories poured in on Instagram and TikTok from tradeswomen expressing their anger and frustration. Over the last week they have shared their own experiences of working with men who threatened them, made sexual advances or joked about their incompetence. They pondered how their story could have ended differently, how their life could have ended like Czech’s.
Angie Cacace, a carpenter from North Carolina, was one of those women who was deeply saddened by Czech’s death. “It hit me pretty hard. I probably have cried about it every day,” she said. “I’ve had altercations with men on job sites so I know that exists.”
Despite the issues she’s faced in the industry, Cacace loves the work and credits carpentry with helping her buy her first home. Now she operates a successful remodeling company.
In 2019, she co-launched a media company and, more recently, a magazine called Move Over Bob, aimed at showing the possibilities of tradeswork to girls in high school and community college. Only about 4% of tradesworkers are women, but if they can find their way into the field, the jobs, which do not require a degree, offer middle-class wages, pensions and other benefits that are often not available in women-dominated industries like caregiving or the service industry.
But Czech’s death has Cacace questioning the workplace she’s urging girls to enter.
“She did everything that we want these girls to do. She did a high school welding program. She went to a community college,” she said. “It’s just a sharp reminder that there’s just a lot of work to do and figuring out how to better advocate and make sure that these young women are safe.”
Czech’s death has opened up a wound that never really closed for tradeswomen. In 2017, 32-year-old Outi Hicks, an apprentice carpenter, was murdered at her workplace by a coworker in Fresno, California. Her death sparked similar outrage and helped spur programs like the “Be That One Guy” campaign, which includes training for bystander intervention in the workplace.
“But there’s a whole host of incidents that have occurred between the Outi Hicks horror and what just transpired,” said Rita Brown, president of the National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC). “Change has been slow, and clearly it’s not enough.”
Instagram posts from tradeswomen across the country share reactions to the killing of Amber Czech, honoring her and calling attention to safety issues in the trades. Editor’s note: Comments have been blacked out to protect commenters’ privacy.

In 2023, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published a report detailing the harassment women and people of color continue to face in the construction trades. It included accounts of sexual harassment like groping and lewd comments, as well as racist incidents. In 2021, a survey conducted by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found that more than a quarter of women tradesworkers who responded said they were “always or frequently harassed” for being a woman.
While there are several programs developed by women and trades organizations to promote a safer and more inclusive workplace, there is no real federal policy or legislation that provides adequate protections, advocates say. Instead the work has happened at the grassroots level.
Now organizations like NAWIC are calling for construction companies, unions and the industry as a whole to enforce stricter workplace standards. “It is incumbent on all of us that are in leadership, that are in any kind of place of power in the ecosystem of the construction industry, to enforce this zero-tolerance policy,” Brown said.
The Tradeswomen Taskforce, an advocacy group, plans to draft a resolution, which they want these same organizations to adopt, that promotes a safe workplace for women.
Amy Roosa, who works in risk control for the construction industry, said that workplace violence should be treated as a safety hazard. “It’s a ticking time bomb at the end of the day that this is going to happen to a woman,” she said. “It’s really up to the leadership team and even safety professionals to treat this like a workplace hazard.
“We need to have an intervention process. We need to have clear reporting. A woman needs to know that when she comes up and says, ‘I have a concern’ or, ‘He’s threatening me,’ that it’s taken seriously,” she added.
At the same time that tradeswomen are urging more to be done to address gender-based violence in the workplace, the Trump administration has curtailed resources.
Last fall, the Tradeswomen Taskforce and Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit focused on gender justice in workplaces, won a $350,000 grant to address gender-based violence in the workplace. The Trump administration abruptly canceled the program, alongside four other grants that aimed to eliminate violence and harassment in the workplace.
Part of the work would have involved helping women navigate how to file complaints or lawsuits, something that is difficult to do on a worksite because they either don’t know the proper channel to elevate a complaint or could face retaliation, said Janelle Dejan, co-chair of the task force. “Things that we do in these advocacy organizations is try to create a safer space,” she said. This includes a place where people can report anonymously or without being ridiculed for having a concern, she said.
Other safeguards that were in place to help women report abuse are no longer functioning, according to Connie Ashbrook, also with the task force. “The EEOC has been squelched,” she said.
Up until October, it didn’t have enough commissioners to issue decisions because the Trump administration fired two of the Democratic commissioners and the general counsel. One of those commissioners, Charlotte Burrows, wrote the report on women’s harassment in the trades. That report has also disappeared from the EEOC’s website.
“It just feels like, at the same time, that we’re really digging deep to work on this problem, the government is taking tools away from us,” Ashbrook said.
In the days since Czech’s death, tradeswomen from across the country have rallied in support, donating thousands of dollars to her family’s GoFundMe and wearing blue to work in her honor.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Fulton County judge has dismissed the case against President Donald Trump and a group of alleged co-conspirators accused of attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.
Judge Scott McAfee’s dismissal marks the end of the last criminal case facing Trump related to that year’s election. Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, requested the dismissal after concluding the case belonged in federal court.
Skandalakis named himself prosecutor in the case this month after he said he could not find another attorney willing to take the case from embattled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 co-defendants in 2023, but Willis was removed from the case in 2024 amid questions of a conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired for the case.

Four of the alleged co-conspirators pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Trump and the other defendants.
Skandalakis did not express sympathy with the view, still espoused by Trump and allies, that the 2020 election had been stolen or rigged.
“Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, millions of citizens and hundreds of politicians continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud,” he wrote. “In response, the Secretary of State undertook extensive audits to verify the vote count and demonstrate that no substantial voter fraud had occurred. Yet, despite these efforts and the evidence confirming a fair election, many individuals continue to believe—and may never be convinced otherwise—that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.”
Trump and the phone call
In a Wednesday motion asking McAfee to drop the charges, Skandalakis called the case unprecedented and noted that bringing a sitting president to trial in Georgia is unrealistic.
“The case is now nearly five years removed from President Trump’s phone call with the Secretary of State, and two years have passed since the Grand Jury returned charges against President Trump and the eighteen other defendants,” Skandalakis wrote.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
A recording of a phone call with Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in January 2021 captured Trump pressing Georgia’s top election official to “find” enough votes to secure a Trump victory in Georgia.
“There is no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial on the allegations in this indictment,” Skandalakis continued. “Donald J. Trump’s current term as President of the United States of America does not expire until January 20, 2029; by that point, eight years will have elapsed since the phone call at issue.”
Skandalakis said that even if Trump were to face trial immediately after leaving office, arguments over presidential immunity alone would tie the case up for months or years, with no guarantee the state would ultimately prevail.
Skandalakis called the phone call “concerning,” but he said it is not a smoking gun, arguing that reasonable minds could disagree on whether Trump was calling on Raffensperger to create fictitious votes or investigate fraud that Trump sincerely but incorrectly believed was real.
“When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally,” Skandalakis found.

Skandalakis did not state whether or not he believes Trump committed crimes in his efforts to overturn the election, but he said Georgia was not the best venue to determine that.
“Elections, particularly presidential elections, are intensely contested events,” Skandalakis wrote. “All too frequently, some campaign staffers, attorneys, and supporters genuinely believe that the nation’s future is at stake if the opposing candidate prevails. Political rhetoric to mobilize voters serves a purpose, but the efforts by President Trump and his legal advisors to obstruct the counting of electoral votes on January 6th lie at the core of this case. This is also why Special Counsel Jack Smith’s federal investigation and prosecution would have been the most appropriate avenue to determine whether the actions of those involved were crimes that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”
U.S. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith dropped that federal election interference case as well as a case alleging Trump mishandled classified documents after the president’s 2024 re-election because he concluded it would be illegal to continue prosecuting him after taking office.
Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, celebrated the decision to dismiss Fulton County’s case Wednesday.
“The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare,” Sadow said.
The Fulton County District Attorney’s office did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.
The other defendants
Skandalakis said he considered severing the other defendants from the case and prosecuting them separately from Trump, but concluded that would be “both illogical and unduly burdensome and costly for the State and for Fulton County.”

The alleged conspiracy included a wide range of acts, from a meeting of “alternate” electors who met at the state Capitol with plans to certify a false Trump victory, a harassment campaign against Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman and the breach of elections systems in Coffee County.
Skandalakis said his examination of the case suggested the alternate GOP electors did not have criminal intent to overturn the election. He had already come to a similar conclusion last year about then-state Sen. Burt Jones, who is now lieutenant governor, after his case was splintered off.
“They genuinely and sincerely believed that their actions were a lawful component of the election contest process. Thus, I find no criminal intent concerning the meeting of the Republican Electors and their plan to preserve an election challenge by casting their ballots for President Trump,” Skandalakis wrote.
With regards to the Coffee County breach, Skandalakis noted that attorney Sidney Powell and bail bondsman Scott Hall, who he called “the primary architect of the scheme” and “a principal accomplice” were among the defendants who pleaded guilty, and Skandalakis argued that pursuing charges against small-fry defendants like former election supervisor Misty Hampton and Coffee County GOP Cathy Latham chair would not be in the state’s interest.
Skandalakis called Freeman, the Fulton County poll worker who faced harassment and intimidation, “a genuinely sympathetic figure in this matter.” But he said the defendants accused of harming her did not do so in Fulton County and that the alleged crimes against her should be prosecuted in neighboring Cobb County, where Freeman lived at the time.
Because of a measure passed this year, the defendants in the case may be able to force Fulton County to cover their legal costs. The new law allows criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct.
Reaction
Josh McKoon. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The dismissal could prove a divisive conversation topic across Georgia Thanksgiving tables. Reaction to the news was split along party lines, with Republicans expressing gratitude for the decision and Democrats calling it an outrage.
“Today, as Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, my heart swells with profound relief, unyielding gratitude, and a fierce sense of vindication for our brave patriots who have endured this dark chapter far too long,” said Georgia GOP chair Josh McKoon in a statement. “Pete Skandalakis, Executive Director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, has done what justice demanded: dismissing this sham, politically weaponized criminal case against President Donald J. Trump, (former) Georgia GOP Chairman David Shafer, and our steadfast contingent of 2020 Presidential Electors.”
Charlie Bailey. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Georgia Democratic chair Charlie Bailey had the polar opposite view.
“The dismissal of this case is a travesty and a slap in the face to Georgia voters,” Bailey wrote in a statement. “Donald Trump and eighteen others, including sitting State Senator Shawn Still, were indicted by a grand jury for attempting to illegally overturn our state’s election. Multiple of their co-defendants pled guilty. This misguided decision denies the people of Georgia the accountability they deserve for Trump and his cronies’ attempt to subvert their votes and silence their voices.”

Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman said opening the program to new applicants comes with the goal of allowing applications for new children in January. Families who fall into the program’s priority groups and who complete registration in December will have the first chance to apply, she said. 
“For most New Jersey families, child care isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity,” Adelman said in a statement. “The child care assistance program is a vital economic lifeline that helps pay for high-quality early childhood education and allows parents to continue their careers. That is why reopening applications to maximize utilization for this program is so important.” 
The program aims to help parents afford child care if they are working, in school, or in job training. Because of a $30 million funding gap that state officials attribute to increasing enrollment and shifting federal policy, the program paused applications in August. Copays for families enrolled in the program also rose after lawmakers passed a budget without enough money to cover the program’s operating costs. 
Earlier this month, advocates sent a letter to Gov. Phil Murphy, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, and legislative leaders urging them to increase funding for the program in the short term and to find a permanent solution to ensure child care is more affordable. 
The first priority groups include families with children from households with very low income or who are experiencing homelessness, and families with children who have special needs. Not everyone who falls into these groups will be granted assistance. 
According to 2024 U.S. Department of Labor data, families in New Jersey spend 7% to nearly 20% of their median family income on child care services. In some counties, that’s more than $16,000. 
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) commended the state’s decision to reopen the program to new applicants, calling it a “victory for the vitality of our families, our early childhood workforce, and our state.” 
“Child care is not just a service; it is a central cog in the system that supports our labor force, children’s academic attainment, and broader economic development,” she said in a statement. 
Families can sign up for texts or email alerts to learn when applications open on the state’s website. Registration forms will be available beginning in December.

A release from the Department of Civil Rights said the charge came in connection to a case involving a volunteer applicant, a person with quadriplegia, who was allegedly denied an accommodation for the position. The health system also allegedly asked during the interview if the person’s disability would interfere with their ability to take on the volunteer position.

“Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act protects residents and visitors from the automatic denial of accommodations for a disability,” Department Executive Director John E. Johnson, Jr. said in a statement. “The law requires organizations to engage in an interactive process to determine if appropriate tools or changes in policy would allow the full use and enjoyment of public resources.”
A spokesperson for McLaren health in a statement said the health system takes “any complaint of discrimination seriously and maintains zero tolerance for inequitable behavior or practices.” 
“For any patient, visitor, employee, or volunteer with a disability requiring accommodation, appropriate accommodations are provided,” the statement said. “We have always been — and remain — committed to fostering a respectful, inclusive environment for all. We are aware of the charge by the MDCR in connection with a matter previously addressed through legal channels.”
McLaren also stated that the case was originally dismissed by the MDCR for lack of merit. 
“This latest action by the MDCR is based on a circuit court decision appeal,” the health system said. “We will defend against this matter through the legal process.”
The charge was filed on Nov. 21, and will now go to a hearing before an administrative law judge, who will review the evidence and provide a recommendation to the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, the final decision-maker in discrimination complaints. There is no time limit on cases of alleged discrimination, but “efforts are made to present the matter to the Commission for consideration within 3-6 months,” the department said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8336-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 14:56:51.756182

Stuart Taylor, a former Kum & Go vice president, is suing the company and Chief Marketing Officer Tracy Ging in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, claiming there was a “blatant disparity” in how the company treated men and women.
Court records indicate Taylor was hired in 2018 as Kum & Go’s vice president of business insights and analytics and later filled the interim roles of vice president of category management and vice president of food service, while retaining his original position.

According to the lawsuit, he initially received favorable performance reviews and was designated a “shooting star” at the company, signifying the company’s recognition of his talent and potential to join the senior leadership team.
In 2020, the company hired Ging as its new chief marketing officer. The lawsuit alleges that within a few months, Ging fired the vice president of food service, Jeff Schamburger, which led to Taylor filling the position on an interim basis.
According to the lawsuit, while Taylor’s work in that role was viewed as a success, Ging stripped him of his “shooting star” designation and hired a woman to fill the position of vice president of food service. She later criticized statements made by Taylor and, the lawsuit claims, “somehow managed to accuse him of gender discrimination based on his neutral suggestion” on a marketing issue. The lawsuit alleges Ging was “accusing Taylor of being chauvinistic simply for voicing an opinion that was different than her own.”
The lawsuit also alleges Taylor “asked Ging why she had accused him multiple times of being sexist. Ging’s response was to apologize, to say that she didn’t really know, but that sometimes people just ‘need a punch in the nose.’”
In addition, the lawsuit claims Ging witnessed a female vice president berating a male colleague and did nothing to intervene, citing the alleged incident as one example of the “blatant disparity in treatment” of men and women at the company.
“Ging tolerates women disrespecting men, but even a perceived slight of a man against a woman was met with an iron fist,” the lawsuit alleges. “Taylor has also been told by another individual who worked with Ging that ‘Tracy is good at strategy, but the thing about her is she just hates men.’”
Taylor alleges Ging fired him April 2023 for pretextual reasons intended to disguise illegal gender discrimination.
A trial date has yet to be scheduled in the case.

Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican and critic of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says negotiations to end the war shouldn't reward Russia's aggression and undermine Ukraine's ability to defend itself in the future. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas joined fellow Republicans warning against negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war that rewarded Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression and left Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy without effective security guarantees.
Moran, the Kansas congressional delegation’s most persistent critic of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, argued that endorsement by President Donald Trump of a deal giving into Putin’s demands would make the world more dangerous. Russia launched this invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
“Lasting peace will be achieved when the costs of continuing the war in Ukraine are unsustainable for Russia, not by acceding to Vladimir Putin’s demands,” Moran said.
Trump expressed support for a 28-point plan introduced by White House envoy Steve Witkoff after meetings with Russian officials. Some U.S. lawmakers criticized the proposal’s concessions to Russia, including ceding of Ukrainian territory. The plan also was denounced because it included a guarantee Ukraine couldn’t join NATO and failed to acknowledge other Ukrainian security interests.
“As negotiations move forward,” Moran said, “the administration must make certain Ukraine is equipped with the tools needed to defend its people and territory against ongoing aggression and demand meaningful, enduring security guarantees for Kyiv.”
In October, Moran said the United States should deliver long-range missiles to Ukraine because the armaments would “help level the battlefield as negotiations hopefully move forward.” Trump chose not to authorize shipment of cruise missiles to Ukraine.
Moran argued in July for sustained support and weapon shipments for Ukraine, because to do otherwise would send a message of weakness to the world.
“If we allow a dictator to redraw borders by force, then what message does that send to other authoritarian regimes watching closely around the globe, including China?” Moran said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Jerry-Moran-ku-cancer-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 14:56:51.756182

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis may get a chance to appoint up to 25 additional judges in his final year in office if the Florida Legislature goes along with a new request from the state Supreme Court.
DeSantis has repeatedly boasted about his efforts to reshape Florida’s judicial branch, including the state Supreme Court. Five of the seven justices on the court were appointed by the Republican governor. The court has made several crucial rulings including one that undid previous decisions on abortion.
Justice Charles Canady announced this month he will step down in January to take a position at the University of Florida. DeSantis will get the chance to name Canady’s replacement.
The state Supreme Court on Wednesday certified the need for 13 circuit court judges and 12 county court judges. The bulk of the court’s request centered on Florida’s 20th Circuit where the court said there is a need to appoint 8 judges in the circuit that covers southwest Florida. The court request also asked for multiple county judges in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Orange counties.

This is the second year in a row the Supreme Court has made a substantial request for new judges. Last year the court found the need for a total of 50 judges spread between circuit courts, county courts, and appeals courts.
The Legislature ultimately agreed to authorize a total of 39 judgeships and many of those have yet to be filled by DeSantis.
New judgeships are filled by gubernatorial appointment, although those appointed to county and circuit posts must be retained by the voters.
Annually the court looks at judicial caseloads and gets reports from the chief judges in each judicial circuit. In its latest set of recommendations the court stated it is “mindful of the state’s current fiscal climate and projected budget shortfalls in subsequent fiscal years and recognizes that establishing new judgeships results in operational and potential fiscal impacts for justice-system partners.”
The Office of State Courts Administrator reports that Florida has 1,060 authorized judgeships not counting those at the state Supreme Court.
DeSantis, who has repeatedly praised U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has gotten to appoint many judges during his two terms in offices.

 Book signing in Ashland

Student poets and author Jacqueline Hamilton will be signing “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky” from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 6, at the Highlands Museum & Discovery Center in Ashland as part of a downtown holiday  celebration. 

Six new poets from Appalachia — all girls and young women — arrived at the recent Kentucky Book Festival at Joseph-Beth Booksellers in Lexington in various parts shy, talkative, nervous and excited about their first poems appearing in the book, “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky.”
Some were still in grade school, the others in middle and high school. They took a seat among about 150 adult writers in a large, open room filled with books, book talk, hope, fear and enduring literary aspirations. The usual stuff.
Each young poet was seated in turn next to their mentor and book creator, Jacqueline Jane Hamilton, 70, a retired Eastern Kentucky University English teacher for whom her students use the more affectionate label Miss JJ. An Ohio native, she has a broad writing background, including journalism, community relations at the Dallas Fire Department, a Rotary International Journalism Fellowship in England, an MFA in nonfiction writing and a doctorate in higher education.
Hamilton’s life has now mostly come down to one thing. Giving back to the alphabet. Creating and preserving writing and poetry from the Kentucky mountains by helping foster a new generation of poets. Her claim, offered on the back page of the book, goes, “Women of Appalachia Kentucky — young and old — can reimagine the world with pencil and paper.”
“I would love to expand this work,” said Hamilton, “and feature more women writers and activists from around Kentucky and Appalachia. I started in my home county of Clark and moved east. I got three libraries, a school and a museum that jumped on the chance to help.”

Along with her teaching and writing she has created and performed portrayals of Boston journalist and social reformer Alice Lloyd, who co-founded Alice Lloyd College in Pippa Passes in Knott County, in 1923, and Louisville novelist and detective writer Sue Grafton. There’s the non-profit Why We Write Inc. she helped create for the book sales and fundraising. Add  the “Inkspire Camps” for other young writers, scheduled for June and July in Lexington and Winchester. With the “Revolutionary Kid Dreaming” writing camps for boys and girls coming this spring to honor the nation’s 250th birthday.
Bringing it all home, she used as her teaching role models the life stories of seven Appalachian heroines: Cora Wilson Stewart, Effie Waller Smith, Jean Bell Thomas, Ollie “Widow” Combs, Harriette Arnow, Verna Mae Stone and Jean Ritchie. Each story was read to the students as part of a larger program, “Appalachia Girl Dreaming,” to find and inspire young female student writers to continue the women’s  tradition. All part of her book, “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky,” a title inspired by the classic “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” — a metaphorical analogy of survival, growth and eventual success from an often-difficult environment. Read New York city streets or Appalachian hills.
Ollie Combs, one of the Appalachian heroines the girls study, lay in front of a bulldozer to protect her land in Knott County from a coal company that planned to strip mine it. She was forcibly removed, arrested and spent Thanksgiving 1964 in jail. Among the notes posted to “Widow Combs:” “You were so brave for doing what you did” and “Were you fearful that the officers would physically hurt you in any way?” (Photo courtesy of Why We Write)
Hamilton was also inspired by a 2014 collection of autobiographical poetry titled “Brown Girl Dreaming” by Jacqueline Woodson, poetry she saw as a strong mentoring text for young students. Seeking further homegrown inspiration, the first page of Hamilton’s book is a poem from Kentucky legend Wendell Berry, “How to be a Poet.” Who else to talk poetry? Its message to all writers goes: 
Accept what comes from silence.
Make the best you can of it.
Of the little words that come
out of the silence, like prayers
prayed back to the one who prays,
make a poem  that does not disturb
the silence from which it came.
Hamilton had somewhat similar thoughts:
“Í wrote the book because I was frustrated by so many students thinking that writing was horrible, boring, difficult, not worthwhile. Kids telling me they don’t need to learn because AI will do it, like a calculator does math.
“I am a firm believer that reading and writing poetry can help write all sorts of things, so I wanted to focus on teaching  about poetry which allows students to use unusual moves as compared to sentences in academic writing. Then I had a belief that if these folks saw their work in print — in an actual beautiful book — they would be encouraged to keep writing.”
Pushing ahead, she received an $18,000 grant from Steele-Reese Foundation, a charitable trust with deep roots in Appalachia. That led to inexpensive, weekly workshops where each young participant received a copy of “Brown Girl Dreaming,” art supplies and six to eight hours of personal instruction. Add singing, fun skits and two copies of “A Pencil Grows” in Kentucky.

The workshops were focused on Hamilton’s three foundations of writing: listening, landscape and language. It stressed poetic listening  to the landscape — often a missing link in good writing — along with its visual cues. Her editing includes changing an old baseball metaphor, “Three strikes and you’re out,” to “Three strikes and you’re in,” giving each student three chances at editing her poem to make it better. Then add a few more strikes if required.
As a result, several hundred poems by 70 young students from Bath, Boyd, Carter, Clark, Fleming, Montgomery and Rowan counties made their way into “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky.” With a half-dozen of those young poets sitting next to Miss JJ at the Kentucky Book Festival. Signing the pages on which their poetry appeared as the book buyers — and proud parents — stopped by. Certifying  them as Published Authors. Part of  Kentucky’s finest book festival. An opportunity so many writers of any age never get.
Hamilton’s help doesn’t end there:
“I also want my young women poets to not think of their time with Appalachia Girl Dreaming as a one and done experience. I have sprinkled Love Notes to participants throughout the book. Encouraging notes are a powerful tool that teachers and families should use more often.”
She followed that advice in her book with a Japanese proverb: “One kind word can  warm three winter months.”
The poems in the book are  living examples of the success of Hamilton, and so many others involved in the various projects. Some poems are surprising in their depth. A few offered a little humor. Many focused on home, family, gardens, the weather, the moment. Other young poets wrote of the mountains rising above them, the shelter offered, the being there with them.
Wandering through the poems in a 240-page book, you find certain sentences, even phrases, that work, each one offering a thought, a smile, a memory, even a warning.
“To be silent is to be ignored.” 
“I am from those moments across time.”
“Fabric woven gently like time’s old cloth.”
“So when you find what’s real, keep it close.”
“I sleep in a purple room with teal bed covers.”
“Disappear is just a word.”

Then, the longer pieces of their poems offer a larger time and place.:
Arsema Haset Smith-Mensah, a 12th-grader from Boyd County writes in “My Claim:”
People see me,
And, yes, see my father.
I have his nose and last name.
But when I look in a mirror
I see coily hair and a toothy grin.
I know I am my mother’s daughter.
Ella Kaufer,  ninth grader from Rowan County wrote “Baked.”
Mountains hold the stories 
of footprints stirred into the dirt –
of people who
chopped its trees,
lived in its caverns,
rested in its shade.
The mountains hold the stories
of those who have traveled 
and have baked their steps
Into earth’s very foundation.

You held me inside for nine months
Now I’m growing older.
I try to help and wonder –
Is it enough?
I don’t want you to hold sadness inside
While you still take care of me
I just hope you know –
You mean everything to me.
Grayce Newcome, a Boyd County 12th-grader, wrote of “The Wooden Porch Swing,’ and wanting to sit on it with “Papa” after a long day of work, the family arguing over who will join him.
somehow our little bodies
all fit together like 
a porch puzzle,
as we sit
on the wooden swing
with Papa.

Wyleigh Osborne of Clark County writes of being “composed of white, drooping dandelions like the ones her Granny kept on her sink, not thinking them weeds.” She finishes:
My very own recipe
For my very own being
A cup of dandelions
A teaspoon of adventures
A pinch of outdoors
My beautiful composition
For I am a weed no more.

Writing doesn’t
Come easily to me.
Writing doesn’t
flow like a river to a lake
Writing forces me to focus —
But sometimes
The words still slip away.
Justice Shirey
Justice Shirey, a fifth-grader from Bath County, writes in “How to Dream” of wanting to go to Princeton, to study law, to become “The Defender” who helps people recover from their mistakes:
Their life is
Not a mistake. …Their life is 
Something to hold on to.
Something to be learned.
Something to teach their children
so they don’t go through the
same pain
their family faced.
Makinzie Coleman, a Clark County 10th-grader, heard silence.
The emptiness speaks
inside the home
The ghosts asking to
be left alone.
The poem “My Heart is in The Hills” by Clark County sixth-grader Raelynn C. Atwood helps bring “A Pencil Grows” in Kentucky home:
The feeling of the earth beneath my feet,
Her warm embrace among fields so sweet.
Blue skies, dirt paths
The pines, the breeze
The sun dancing softly
Through whispering trees
I long to lose my cares where wild creeks roam
Where rivers sing and the hills call me home.

Kyndall McKnight, a seventh-grader in Boyd County, touches all the bases with “More.”
Appalachia
More than mountains.
More than hillbillies.
Rooted
More than music.
More than land.
Home
More than acceptance.
More than comfort.
We are one and other.
Hamilton said all the initial $18,000  grant has been used, with sales from her book being used to fund more poetry classes. She is seeking more sponsors as everyone involved is working for free. Meanwhile, she has received another $18,000 grant from the Steele-Reese Foundation to create more camps for boys and girls focused on listening — that often missing ingredient in life.
“I think I can keep this going,” she said, “as long as my health holds up.”

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The state of Alaska is asking a federal appeals court to re-examine a district court decision that denied the state almost 20,000 acres of potentially oil-rich land. 
On Monday, the Alaska Department of Law filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an 11-year-old lawsuit that is attempting to fix the location of the western border of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
That border has been disputed between the state and the federal government for decades and matters because the land in the disputed area is believed to contain significant amounts of oil.
“The public land order that created ANWR placed its western boundary on the ‘extreme west bank of the Canning River.’ Despite this clear language, the Bureau of Land Management had placed the boundary on the western bank of a separate and distinct river — the Staines — and the federal court got it wrong too,” the Department of Law said in a statement. “This dispute affects approximately 20,000 acres of Alaska’s lands, which are believed to have valuable oil and gas reserves.”
If the land is not within the refuge, it would still be federally owned but could be selected for eventual transfer to the state. 
A ruling in the state’s favor might eventually result in oil and gas drilling that would generate millions of dollars in state and local revenue.
A ruling in the federal government’s favor would either protect the land from development or allow oil and gas development under the federal government’s controversial and legally challenged refuge drilling plan.
The appeal comes less than 30 days after District Court Judge Judge Sharon Gleason entered a judgment against the state and in favor of the federal government.
No schedule has yet been set for proceedings in the circuit court.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is among more than 20 Democratic state elected officials suing the Trump administration to block an abrupt change in the allocation of federal funds to address homelessness.
Housing advocates warn that the administration’s decision, announced Nov. 13, to shift billions of dollars in grants could put as many as 170,000 formerly homeless people back on the street. 
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, alleged the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is violating the intent of Congress by moving grants away from providing permanent housing.
Beshear in a statement provided in a press release called the funding shift “illegal and cruel” and said it would “cause more people — like veterans and families — to go homeless and make our communities less safe.” 
Many Kentuckians at risk of returning to homelessness because of federal funding switch

“We should be helping people get back on their feet through a safe place to call home, not barring them from any chance of success. These policy changes are wrong and dangerous, and they will set our commonwealth and country back,” Beshear said.
For more than a decade, HUD has put about 90% of funding through what’s known as Continuum of Care grants toward “permanent, supportive housing” which provides people — often those who have spent years on the streets and need mental health care — with a safe place to live and services such as counseling and financial education. The move by HUD would allow only 30% of the grants to go toward permanent housing. Most of the money would instead go to short-term, “transitional” housing aimed at getting people into jobs and in charge of their own housing.
Kentucky housing aid advocates previously told the Lantern the policy change would put more people at risk of homelessness. At stake is much of about $48 million that flows to Kentucky each year in HUD money, with the largest portion, $23 million, going to Louisville.
In Kentucky, around 3,700 individuals with disabling conditions live in permanent, supportive housing, which advocates say has proven to be the best solution for preventing homelessness. “We know that permanent housing is the solution to homelessness,” said Catherine McGeeney, communications director for the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless, which coordinates HUD funding for the area. “It effectively ends homelessness.”
The changes would affect a wide range of programs throughout Kentucky, said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, including housing help offered by domestic violence, veterans and mental health groups as well as agencies that directly serve the homeless. 
“There are folks who without this program would be homeless. They most likely will be homeless again without rent support and case management,” said Bush.
HUD Secretary Scott Turner in a press release announcing the policy change said it would stop “the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Following the busiest year on record for the U.S. National Park Service, which saw more than 331 million visitors in 2024, the Department of the Interior announced this week changes to how national parks will be accessed next year.
The major change is the implementation of resident and nonresident fees for national parks, an idea the federal government proposed earlier this summer.
While entry costs and annual passes for U.S. residents will not change, nonresident visitors will pay a higher rate to increase funds that support maintenance of the park system.

Starting Jan. 1, nonresident visitors will pay $250 for an annual America the Beautiful pass, while U.S. residents will continue to pay $80. The annual passes allow a vehicle, or four individuals, to access more than 2,000 recreation sites managed by federal agencies including DOI, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
In addition to the increased cost of annual passes, the nation’s 11 most visited national parks will charge $100 to nonresidents, on top of the standard entrance fee, which is $35 for a private vehicle at the most popular parks such as Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park.
Both of Montana’s national parks are among the top-10 most visited, with Yellowstone ranking fourth in 2024 with 4.7 million visitors, and Glacier ranking 10th, with 3.2 million.
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
The department said in a press release that the “America-first entry fee policies” are designed to ensure “American taxpayers who already support the National Park System receive the greatest benefit.
Annual passes will continue to be offered at a discounted price for seniors, and for free for military members, U.S. residents with permanent disabilities, all U.S. 4th grade students, and federal recreation site volunteers.
The international surcharge for park visitation is an idea long championed by the Property and Environment Research Center, a Bozeman-based “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank.
PERC has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years as a way to increase budgets and address growing backlogs of maintenance at National Parks at a time when visitation is routinely breaking records, and published a report earlier this year that considered different fee structure scenarios.
Using Yellowstone as an example, a $100 international surcharge for visitors could raise an additional $55.2 million in entry fees for the park, while only leading to a decrease of roughly 57,000 visitors, PERC estimated.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Tate Watkins, a research fellow at PERC, told the Daily Montanan earlier this year. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
Other countries have similar fee structures that charge international visitors higher prices, including the often-cited Galapagos Islands, where Ecuadorian adults pay $30 to visit, while foreign tourists pay $200.
There is a similar system in place in Montana to access state parks, where residents pay a $9 annual fee with their vehicle registration and can access state parks all year. Nonresidents, however, are charged $50 for an annual fee or $8 per entrance.
Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, former Secretary of the Interior during President Donald Trump’s first term, praised the move on Wednesday.
“President Trump and Secretary Burgum are putting Americans first by asking foreign visitors to pay their fair share while holding entrance fees steady for the American people,” Zinke and West Virginia Rep. Wes Moore said in a joint statement. “This policy ensures that our beautiful national heritage is preserved and the critical maintenance backlog is addressed so that America’s national parks will remain affordable, well-maintained, and financially sustainable for generations to come. We owe it to future generations of Americans — our children and grandchildren — to ensure our beautiful natural heritage that God created is well preserved.”
Zinke and Moore introduced the “Protecting America’s Treasure by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists (PATRIOT) Parks Act earlier this year, which would codify the foreign fees to national parks.
Companion legislation in the Senate was introduced by U.S. Sens. Tim Sheehy of Montana and Jim Banks of Indiana.
More changes, digital first
Another part of the changes include a modernization of park passes, including offering digital America the Beautiful passes.
The passes will be fully available in a digital format through Recreation.gov, as opposed to visitors having to purchase a hard copy. Similar to using a digital wallet or a mobile ID app, visitors can store their passes on a phone and they can be used to enter federal recreation sites.
The America the Beautiful pass will also cover the entrance fee for up to two motorcycles.
New designs for the the annual passes have also been unveiled by the Department.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Glacier_sign_2-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

Alan Schmidt, who filed the lawsuit, said Rankin County deputies beat and sexually assaulted him in late 2022. Three of the involved deputies were sentenced to federal and state prison terms last year, in part for their role in the incident. They are also defendants in the lawsuit.
In the lawsuit, which represents one side of a legal argument, Schmidt alleged that the department was responsible for a pattern of misconduct by deputies and jail guards, listing several other lawsuits against deputies and county jail guards. 
While he’s seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for his own pain and suffering, he said he is also filing the lawsuit on behalf of everyone who has been abused by the sheriff’s department.
“There are many things that go on in this county that have gone on for many years,” Schmidt said. “I want justice for everyone that has been wronged.”
The department did not respond to a request for comment. 
In December 2022, deputies pulled Schmidt from his car and beat him while he was handcuffed, the lawsuit alleges. One deputy pressed his arm into an anthill, and former narcotics investigator Christian Dedmon fired a gun near Schmidt’s head while interrogating him about the location of stolen tools he believed Schmidt had taken. 
Dedmon punched Schmidt and shocked him several times with Deputy Hunter Elward’s Taser, then pulled out his own genitals and attempted to rub them in Schmidt’s face, the lawsuit claims.
Dedmon pleaded guilty to violating Schimdt’s constitutional rights, but has since denied the sexual assault. Former deputies Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke pleaded guilty to failing to stop the beating, according to court documents.  
The deputies also pleaded guilty to a separate late-night raid of the home of Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, two Black men who were tortured and called racial slurs for hours by five deputies and a Richland police officer in early 2023. 
Schmidt’s lawsuit is the latest in a series of allegations from people who say they were brutalized by Rankin County sheriff’s deputies and guards at the county jail, which is run by the sheriff’s department. 
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times found that the Rankin County deputies, some of whom referred to themselves as the Goon Squad, had been torturing people they suspected of using drugs for nearly two decades. 
The Justice Department launched an investigation into a potential pattern of civil rights violations at the department last year. That investigation is ongoing. 
Dedmon has since said publicly that the abuses he participated in were part of a widespread practice at the department, where deputies would routinely enter homes illegally, beat people and humiliate them to extract information and scare criminal suspects out of the county.
A recent investigation by the publications found that for years, guards and administrators at the Rankin County jail brutalized the inmates in their care, sometimes enlisting other inmates with special privileges, called trusties, to help them beat inmates who broke jail rules. 
Schmidt’s attorney, Trent Walker, who has represented several people who say they were brutalized by the sheriff’s department, said Schmidt’s case proves the entrenched culture of violence at the agency. 
“The case puts the lie to any claim that what happened to Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker was isolated,” he said. “ I want the citizens of Rankin County, specifically, to be able to look at this case and the other cases and say that it’s enough, it’s time for a fresh start.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26120620/GOON-SQUADSchmidt_10.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)More bad news for Rhode Islanders struggling to pay their energy bills: Hikes are coming.
Rhode Island Energy unveiled its long-anticipated request to increase service charges for gas and electric customers in a press release the day before the Thanksgiving holiday. An application was simultaneously submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission for review.
The documents were not immediately available from the commission Wednesday morning. Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, declined to provide a copy when asked.
If approved, the increases would take effect in September 2026. The average residential electric customer would see their monthly bills rise $7.78, or 4.83%, while a typical residential gas customer would pay $343.53 more per year, a 20.6% increase, according to Rhode Island Energy.
Gov. Dan McKee blasted the proposal in a statement released just after 1 p.m.
“This is not the time for a utility rate increase,” McKee said. “With costs rising nationwide and families already burdened, my focus remains fixed on affordability for every Rhode Islander.”
Anticipating the fury coming its way, Rhode Island Energy President Greg Cornett attempted to justify the proposal by highlighting the benefits for customers. 
“This review is about making smart, necessary investments in reliability, customer service, and safety, while also keeping affordability top of mind and strengthening support for those who need it most,” Cornett said in a statement Wednesday. “Throughout this process, we want our customers to understand that we are keenly aware of the challenges so many of them are facing, and that we are committed to keeping customers informed and helping them manage their energy costs now and into the future.”
State regulators prevented the utility supplier from asking for a distribution rate increase for the last three years under the terms of the 2022 sale of gas and electric operations from National Grid to PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company. 
The moratorium ends this year, and Rhode Island Energy is ready to take back what it claims it needs to offset inflation and supply chain expenses.
For example, the cost of installing a 1-mile section of underground electric cable has nearly doubled, from $12,000 in 2020 to $22,000 today, according to the company. Electric surge protectors now cost $120, compared with $60 in 2020. Upgrading natural gas pipelines now come in at nearly triple the price, the company said.
“The proposed increase is necessary for [Rhode Island Energy] to continue to meet regulatory mandates, align with the real cost of doing business, and continue delivering around-the-clock service,” the press release stated.
The company expects to generate an additional $230 million in operating revenue over a two-year period from its proposal, according to a federal financial disclosure statement also filed on Wednesday.
PPL’s profits and shareholder returns have come under scrutiny by state lawmakers and consumer advocates, who contrast company earnings with cash-strapped residents struggling to pay their winter energy bills. Electricity prices have only abated slightly since reaching record highs three years ago
Under state law, the company cannot recoup any money from its usage rates, which are instead set directly by prices from third-party suppliers. 
Adding to public fury: accounting errors which revealed the company overbilled state agencies $2 million in their 2024 energy bills. State utility regulators are reviewing complaints from residential customers who allege they have been overcharged, including on the rollout of 540,000 smart electric meters statewide.
The Public Utilities Commission has final authority over any increases in electric and gas rates. The three-person panel considers the financial solvency of the company alongside ratepayer affordability and the true necessity of proposed capital projects. Historically, the commission has trimmed some money from the original company requests to blunt the impact on ratepayers.
The last time the commission reviewed a distribution rate increase, under National Grid’s ownership, was in 2017. The approved rates were 40% less than what National Grid asked for. 
Earlier this week, Chairman Ronald Gerwatowski highlighted the commission’s ability to influence distribution of customer bill credits, which Rhode Island Energy must refund to customers under the terms of the 2022 sale. Rhode Island Energy withdrew its initial proposal earlier this month amid scrutiny over the calculations, but plans to file an alternative scheme early next year.
The discounts, which aim to shield ratepayers from company tax and accounting expenses related to the 2022 sale, could help mitigate higher service charges, Gerwatowski said Monday.
McKee pledged to “continue fighting” for Rhode Island Energy’s original $150 million bill credit plan. He also said his fiscal 2027 budget proposal, unveiled in January, will include “millions of dollars” in energy savings.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)West Virginia families statewide who have a religious or philosophical objection to the state’s school vaccination requirements must be allowed to attend school, a Raleigh County judge ruled on Wednesday.
Circuit Judge Michael Froble ruled that the West Virginia and Raleigh County school boards’ policy not to accept religious exemptions is a violation of the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. The school boards are prohibited from enforcing the school vaccination requirements on those seeking a religious or philosophical exemption, the judge wrote.
“For the avoidance of all doubt, the Enjoined Defendants shall not prevent the Plaintiffs, members of the Class, or their minor children from enrolling in school, attending school, or participating in extracurricular sports because of their vaccination status,” Froble wrote in a 74-page ruling. 
In response to the ruling, the state Board of Education said Wednesday it is suspending the policy on compulsory vaccination requirements pending further proceedings on the matter before the state Supreme Court. 
The lawsuit brought by Raleigh County residents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter on behalf of their children against the school boards is at the center of a debate over West Virginia’s vaccine law and religious freedom that is likely to be determined by the state Supreme Court. 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases, including polio, measles and chickenpox. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow children to opt out of the vaccine requirements based on a religious or philosophical objection. The state has only allowed medical exemptions. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state Department of Health to allow religious exemptions. The order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have added the exemptions to state law. 
The state Board of Education earlier this year voted to instruct county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions. 
Froble in July had granted a preliminary injunction in the case that allowed students who are parties to the lawsuit to attend class while the proceedings continued. 
According to Froble’s ruling in October,  Wednesday’s ruling applies to any family who has sought, obtained or will seek an exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements under the Equal Protection for Religion Act unless those families have received a final judgement on the merits in their own lawsuits in the matter. State Health Department officials  have said about 570 families so far sought a religious or philosophical exemption. 
In his ruling Wednesday, Froble wrote that the families’ religious beliefs and practices regarding vaccination have been “substantially burdened” by the school board’s policy not to allow them to attend school.
The state Board of Education filed a notice in September it would appeal Froble’s decision. The high court has given the school board until Dec. 12 to prepare its appeal, after which the justices will consider the case.
A handful of other lawsuits over religious exemptions have been filed in the state. Kanawha County Circuit judge Rich Lindsay last month dismissed a lawsuit filed against the Kanawha County board of education, saying that the governor does not have authority to make laws. 
In a statement Wednesday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey applauded Froble’s ruling. 
“Today’s ruling is a win for every family forced from school over their faith,” Morrisey said in the statement. “I will always take a stand for religious liberty and for the children of this state. I applaud the court for upholding West Virginia’s Equal Protection for Religion Act.”

Ziogas and former state deputy budget director Konstantinos Diamantis were scheduled to go to trial early next year, but now instead Ziogas could be a witness for the prosecution — as could his fianceé, Helen Zervas, who has already pleaded guilty to her role in the scheme.
Court officials said there is no mention in the 13-page plea agreement about whether Ziogas will be required to testify at Diamantis’ upcoming trial in the Zervas matter, and the issue was not brought up during Wednesday’s hearing. That trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 8 in Bridgeport.
Attorney Matthew Maddox, who represents Ziogas, declined to say whether his client will testify against Diamantis.
Diamantis’ Attorney Norm Pattis said Wednesday he was “surprised by the plea.”
“I fully expect that he will be called to testify at the trial, and I look forward to cross examining him,” Pattis said.
Diamantis has already been convicted of bribery and extortion for his role in steering school construction contracts, but Judge Stefan Underhill, who presided over the first trial, has postponed that sentencing until after the next trial.
Diamantis, the former deputy secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, is also facing bribery, extortion and filing a false statement charges in the Zervas case. Diamantis is currently free on a $500,000 bond.
Ziogas appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert M. Spector during his change of plea hearing in U.S. District Court in New Haven on Wednesday. Spector quizzed Ziogas about whether he understood what he was pleading guilty to and then asked Ziogas to describe in his own words what he had done.
“I participated in a scheme with Helen and Kosta to try and have him suppress some activity in Medicaid charges that she was facing,” Ziogas said, adding “we paid him (Kosta) to help influence the outcome of the audit.” 
When asked by the judge what he had specifically done, Ziogas added, “Helen gave me money, and I gave it to Kosta — maybe $100,000.”
[The Kosta Diamantis timeline]
Ziogas also pleaded guilty to providing a false statement to FBI agents and to bank fraud for taking $5,500 out of an account that he was the trustee of without the client’s knowledge.
Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing between 70-87 months in prison. Ziogas was allowed to remain free on the $500,000 bond that has been in place since his arrest last February.
The case has its roots in a Medicaid audit that was scheduled in early 2020.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Ziogas hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to DSS in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that Zervas improperly billed.
After that check was delivered to the state Department of Social Services office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period. 
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
“They can look at whatever they want,” Ziogas said in an interview at his Bristol home in 2023. “I’ve got nothing to hide.”
Zervas pleaded guilty last February to health care fraud charges and admitted that she conspired with a former state lawmaker and former high-ranking Connecticut employee to pressure officials at the state’s Medicaid agency to cancel an audit that was examining Medicaid overpayments at her optometry practice.
At that time, federal prosecutors would not identify those public officials. But less than three weeks later, Ziogas and Diamantis were indicted.
Zervas admitted that she intended to bribe Diamantis, “the high-ranking state official,” into pressuring state employees at DSS.
She eventually paid Diamantis $95,000. Much of it passed through Ziogas and was taken from her business Family Eye Care, according to the indictment.
The last payment of $65,000 to Diamantis was made three days after the two men hand-delivered the check to DSS.
In total, the federal prosecutors alleged Zervas fraudulently billed the state’s Medicaid program on more than 300 occasions between 2015 and 2020. She did the same for Medicare patients, but less frequently. 
Diamantis and Ziogas have been close associates for some time. When Diamantis’ daughter Anastasia needed an attorney during an investigation into how she got a job in former Chief State’s Attorney’s Richard Colangelo’s office, it was Ziogas, who did not have a law license at the time, who represented her. 
Ziogas served three terms as the state representative for the 79th District in Bristol before leaving office in January 2023.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ziogas-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Some Montana residents may receive a holiday bonus thanks to the Office of the Commission of Securities and Insurance. 
A coordinated multi-state task force, which included the Montana Auditor’s Office, had been investigating five major brokerage firms for allegedly charging unreasonable minimum commissions in violation of federal law and totaling nearly $19 million. 
This summer, the task force announced settlements with the five firms, and Montana Auditor James Brown told the Daily Montanan this week that the next phase — letting Montanans know if they were affected and getting them their money back — is underway. 
“We take our consumer protection role pretty seriously at this agency and we have some really good news to announce to folks who have been wronged,” Brown said in a phone interview. “… We are glad we are able to do our duty as Montana’s watchdog, protect Montanans’ money and hold firms accountable.”
Brown said that roughly $160,000 of Montanans’ money was recovered in restitution and will be paid back from the brokerage firms. 
His office is sending out letters to all Montanans who were affected customers, letting them know they’ll be reimbursed their dollars. Some brokerage firms may have checks in the mail or will deposit money directly into accounts, he said. 
“We’re going to be giving a number of Montanans some good Thanksgiving news,” Brown said. 
Earlier this year, the auditor’s office announced national settlements with five major firms — Edward Jones, LPL Financial, RBC Capital Markets, Stifel, Nicolaus and Company, and TD Ameritrade. 
Securities regulators from Alabama, Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri, Texas and Washington, as well as Montana, had investigated allegations that the firms had charged unreasonable minimum commissions to retail customers that often exceeded 5% of the principal amount on small equity trades. 
From 2018 to 2025, according to the investigations, the five firms collectively charged nearly $19 million in excessive commissions across more than 1.1 million transactions. 
Brown said that in Montana, the five firms collectively mischarged more than 8,000 transactions resulting in $160,000 in restitution for Montana victims. 
Under the settlements, the companies have also agreed to pay administrative fines, cover investigative costs to the states, review their policies and compliance systems, and are censured, and must permanently cease and desist from charging unreasonable commissions. 
“This settlement with these firms on these transactions that violated federal law is just another step we’ve taken since I became commissioner to hold Wall Street firms accountable when they engage in wrongdoing,” Brown said. “If a firm overcharges Montana investors, they can expect a knock on the door from my team.”
Brown added that additional investigations are still underway with other, unnamed companies. 
The commissioner’s office is asking Montanans to check their mailboxes for the letters from the office informing them if they are covered by the settlements, and to check for checks or brokerage statements if they are expecting to receive restitution. 
Residents can contact the state securities and insurance office via email at csi.securities@mt.gov or by calling 406-444-2040.
Earlier this year, the auditor’s office announced a multi-state settlement with Edward Jones following an investigation into the brokerage charging front-load commissions. 
Another settlement, announced in May,  with the Vanguard Group, Inc, resolved an investigation into capital gains tax distributions from retirement funds back in 2021.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_7117-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

The former co-owner of Crane Brewing swallowed his pride to buy reduced-priced $6 meals at a local grocery store to stretch the family budget at an uncertain moment.
What happened when he went to pay at the counter left him slack-jawed.
The cashier told him that a stranger had already paid for hundreds of meals. Meyers insisted on paying so someone even less fortunate could get a free dinner.
But the random act of kindness overwhelmed him.
“I just immediately started tearing up and almost had to step out of line,” Meyers told The Beacon. “Sometimes you don’t realize you’re right on the edge until one more straw on the camel’s back. It just really hit, knowing how much that hopefully meant for people who are in even worse positions.”
The financial anxiety Meyers describes is borne out by numbers that show that roughly half of us are struggling to make ends meet.
A new report from the Urban Institute found that 52% of American families earn less than what researchers call the “true cost of economic security” — meaning they don’t make enough to cover all their regular bills, pay for necessities and still have money left over to save for emergencies. In Kansas that number is 46.9%, and in Missouri 48.6% of people are in a similar position.
“I think more people are living paycheck-to-paycheck than would like to admit it,” Meyers said. “The cost of everything being more expensive is really tough.”
Rising costs coupled with stagnant wages are putting a squeeze on working people across the spectrum in Kansas City. The squeeze is reflected in the hard choices people are making as they grapple with higher costs for housing, groceries, health care and child care.
 Brutal math


The most glaring reason for this burgeoning affordability crisis is that wages have not grown as fast as prices for the basics working people buy.

The Urban Institute’s affordability tracker says that nationally, the average monthly grocery bill is up 32% while wages have only gone up 29% since 2019.
“I saw where a pound of ground beef was almost as expensive as the federal minimum wage,” Meyers noted.
But it’s not just groceries.
Nationally, the rising cost of essentials from January 2017 to August 2025 outpaced wage growth during the same time period:

The cost of child care for two children has risen 40%.
Rent jumped 50%.
Home sale prices have surged by 80%.
And the lowest-priced “silver” plan on the health care marketplace went up by 41%.

Wages, meanwhile, only rose by 38%.
Locally, Kansas City-area workers are also paid less than workers in similar cities. According to the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC), average hourly earnings here run 15% to 20% below peer metros like Minneapolis and Denver.
Frank Lenk, MARC’s director of the Office of Economic Research, told the 2025 KC Economic Outlook event this month that the Kansas City labor market is weakening. He also noted that the area’s economic recovery from the COVID pandemic has been slower than in the rest of the U.S.
“This is a classic Kansas City story,” Lenk said. “We don’t bust as low. … But we don’t boom as high.”
Lenk said that economic boom times generally last longer than busts. In Kansas City that means with each boom-and-bust business cycle, the local economy falls further behind peer metros bit by bit.
Jeremy Hill, a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, told the same group that lower wages in Kansas and Missouri also mean it’s harder to attract talent to the area.
“We don’t really have a labor problem, we have a wage problem,” Hill said.



Hill said that across sectors in Missouri and particularly in Kansas, businesses have higher expectations of productivity but often aren’t willing to pay higher wages for it.
When adjusted for inflation, average wages in Kansas have risen by just $20 a week between January 2017 and August 2025. Missouri has done slightly better with an average weekly pay increase of $30 during the same nearly nine-year period.
These small wage increases come during a time when workers are as productive as ever.



“This has been a trend for a long time in the U.S.,” University of Kansas economics Professor David Slusky told The Beacon. “A trend where… the amount of stuff a worker can make is growing more than workers’ wages each year.”
Slusky said the gap between productivity growth and wage growth means that while workers produce more value, they’re not seeing that value reflected in their paychecks.
Despite doing more than ever, area workers are losing buying power for basic necessities. This makes it increasingly difficult just to stay healthy, put food on the table, take care of your children or keep a roof over your head.
 Housing price spikes


Megan Overfelt moved to Raytown, Missouri, hoping to save money before she bought a home in Johnson County, Kansas, where she grew up.

That was six years ago. She’s watched housing prices soar ever since.
“How do people get ahead in this kind of climate?” Overfelt said. “I was supposed to be here for a year or two to save money. … Now those hopes and dreams seem so far out of reach.”
Overfelt, a data entry worker in her 30s with four children, says her childhood home was approximately 1,500 square feet located in “not a big, fancy, rich part of Johnson County.” Last year it sold for $375,000.
Housing prices in the area have surged beyond what many working families can afford, pushing homeownership further out of reach (File Photo/The Beacon).
According to data from the Greater Kansas City Regional Housing Partnership, nearly two out of three owner-occupied homes are valued at $300,000 or more in Johnson County. The average sale price in the county in October of this year was $465,000, according to Redfin.
“That’s insane to me, I don’t see how normal everyday working families can move up,” Overfelt said. “It’s like we are all just stuck.”
She considers herself lucky to have a landlord who has kept her rent below the median Raytown rent of $1,213 a month. She says she has neighbors with similar layouts who pay up to $1,700 a month.
“I’ve just kind of accepted that we might be renting forever,” Overfelt said.
 Child care can cost a job


Marie H. is a single mother in her 20s who says she had to leave her job because she couldn’t afford child care.
“I’ve always made less than $20 an hour and the cheapest child care I could find was $250 a week,” she said. “I can’t find a job that pays enough to cover that and my other bills.”
Marie H. is a domestic violence survivor who is being referred to by an alias in this article for her safety. She said that after leaving a women’s shelter with her young child she’s taken to delivering food for income.
She brings her child along for deliveries, which saves her the expense of child care. Marie H. said that bends delivery app rules, but it is a risk she has to take. She told The Beacon that the gig work is inconsistent, meaning she’s working with no financial flexibility and most months she’s still falling behind.
Child care costs an average of $23,300 a year in Missouri and $24,400 in Kansas for two children. According to 2022 data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the cost of one infant’s care in Jackson County is the equivalent of 13.5% of median family income in the area.

Childcare costs consume a growing share of family budgets, with Kansas City parents paying thousands annually for care (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).
Some parents opt out of the workforce in the face of ever-rising child care prices. The Center for American Progress estimated in 2019 that the national economy sees $57 billion a year in lost revenue, wages and productivity because of parents leaving the workforce.
Marie H. says that she has career goals and is working as much as she can, but her lack of affordable child care is holding her back.
“I’m willing to work, even as a cashier or at McDonald’s or something like that,” she said. “I just need the grace of somebody to help me with child care so I can get on my feet.”
 Health care eating wages


Rising health care costs are another squeeze point for working families. While many in Kansas City dread the prospect of health care premiums doubling next year, growing health care costs are also quietly eroding wages.
Economics professor Slusky said total compensation — a measure that includes wages plus benefits like health care — has more closely tracked productivity than wages alone.

This means employers that provide health care are putting more money towards their employees’ health insurance each year, leaving less money available for wage increases if the employer doesn’t cut elsewhere.
“Health insurance is eating up a greater share of total compensation,” Slusky said.
Kansas City Federal Reserve Senior Vice President A. Lee Smith at the KC Economic Outlook event said that higher input costs are contributing to a job market cooling at the national level. Those higher costs are being driven, in part, by recent Trump administration tariffs and employer health care expenses.
“The employer cost of health benefits is up about 6% over the past year,” Smith said. “Which is a really high pace of increase relative to what we’ve seen over the past 10 years or so.”
Meyers said his family’s health insurance premiums have nearly tripled over the past decade.
“We also just got notified that they’re going to decrease the amount they cover,” Meyers said.
Overfelt says she can afford health insurance for herself through her employer but feels fortunate to receive some federal assistance for her children’s coverage.
“I have no idea what we would do otherwise, because insurance for families through most employers is more than half your paycheck,” Overfelt said.
 Hard choices


For many, living close to the bone financially means choosing which bills to pay. Those hard choices show up in data that tracks financial distress.
Delinquent credit card debt has doubled since 2021 in both Kansas and Missouri. Now one in 20 people with a credit card in those states is 60 days or more behind on payments. The credit card delinquency increases coincide with when food prices began to jump.

Meyers says his grocery budget has nearly doubled — from $200-$300 every other week at Costco to $400-$500 now.
Families navigate grocery shopping as food costs continue to strain household budgets in the area (Chase Castor/The Beacon).
The bigger change is restaurants.
“We almost never eat out anymore,” Meyers said. “We cook pretty much everything at home.”
As a result, Meyers has chef friends he doesn’t see as much anymore.
“I have to tell them: ‘I promise you I’m not ditching you or dodging you,” Meyers said. “I still love you. I still love your food. I miss it. I just, it’s not something we can really do as much anymore.’”
Marie H. said she doesn’t have delinquent debt but she also hasn’t eaten a meal not made in her home for over a year. Financial sacrifices extend to her own health. She doesn’t even think about going to the doctor for herself.
“I basically make just enough to cover my car payment and rent,” Marie H. said. “I have zero left over for anything else.”
The crush over bills for the basics makes it even more difficult to save for a rainy day.
“I don’t think the concept of savings — no matter what level you’re on — is really a thing anymore,” Meyers said.
Overfelt has made belt-tightening decisions for her family as expenses pile up. Some months that has meant canceling a subscription, and sometimes that has meant paying late or only a partial payment until the next paycheck.
“That’s kind of been this entire last year. It’s extremely rough financially just trying to keep up,” Overfelt said. “It’s definitely a juggle each month. A lot of that boils down to making sure that the kids are fed and they have a roof over their head.”
Slusky says the good news is that the resources to address the affordability crisis exist in America. The country’s overall wealth is at an all-time high — but it’s increasingly concentrated.
“The question is what more could be done… to help those least fortunate with these resources, while maintaining the incentive structure that produces that level of wealth,” Slusky said.
He emphasizes the need for predictable, sustainable public policy rather than dramatic changes that create uncertainty for both businesses and workers.
“The resources are there,” Slusky said. “We just need the political will to try to address these concerns.”
Until paychecks catch up or costs come down, about half of Kansas City will keep choosing between eating and healing, between saving and surviving.
“Whenever you’re in a situation like this, it’s 24/7,” Marie H. said. “It’s just work. Or stress about work. Or stress about money, with no break. Everyone deserves time to take a breath.”

Advocates worry the change will mean more families will go hungry, and health officials warn of the dangers of malnutrition and food insecurity. The people affected represent about 10% of the state’s residents who receive benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Some organizations are asking state lawmakers to set up ongoing aid for people affected by the policy shift who will no longer qualify for SNAP under the new law.
“When you’ve got a family who are looking at a budget that doesn’t work — their income doesn’t balance with their expenses — they start saying, ‘What can we squeeze?’ Rent is what it is, you have no power to negotiate health insurance premiums, the cost of gas is what it is. One area where families have some flexibility to squeeze a budget down is food,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut.

“They’re going to look for the cheapest options. They don’t have the luxury to look for the most nutritious food for their kids. They look for the cheapest volume of food for the dollar, and that is going to breed all sorts of problems.”
The cuts to food assistance in H.R. 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will directly affect about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness due to new, stricter work requirements for SNAP benefits or other changes. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
“We’re going to have a whole lot of people who don’t have access to the food they need to stay healthy,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance. “People are going to eat as frugally as they can, which means a lot of really inexpensive foods that they’re able to buy because they don’t have the advantage of SNAP anymore.”

A call for action
With many poised to lose benefits, advocates are asking elected officials to create a state-funded food assistance program to fill the gap.
Since at least the 1990s, Connecticut had a state-financed food stamp program for legal immigrants who otherwise would have been eligible for the federal program but were excluded by welfare reform legislation in 1996. The legislature in August 2016 directed the state Department of Social Services to stop adding people to the program, though the initiative was funded through 2017, officials with DSS said.
In September, representatives with Greater Hartford Legal Aid, New Haven Legal Assistance and Connecticut Legal Services sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders asking them to, among other things, establish a state-funded food assistance program for previously eligible legal immigrants and others who may lose SNAP benefits.
“We urge you to address the imminent harm to low-income CT residents that cuts to SNAP in H.R. 1 are poised to inflict. Our low-income clients depend on SNAP benefits to feed themselves and their families and depend on information and resources provided by DSS to access those benefits,” six people with those organizations wrote.
They asked that the issue be addressed in a special session that was held earlier this month, though lawmakers declined to do so. In recent interviews, advocates urged legislators to make it a priority in the regular session that begins in February.
“There is history of [a state-financed program], and we would like to see that again — a new program that essentially picks up all the folks who are no longer eligible for exemptions,” McKernan said. “We’re talking about folks who have been physical laborers their entire life, and all of a sudden, they’re getting to the stage where their bodies are giving out and they can no longer compete with younger workers. We’re talking about folks who have raised their kids or grandkids and now have an empty house and no work history. They may have kids over the age of 14, but they can’t act in that caretaker role and get SNAP.
“There are a lot of reasons why people can’t compete in the job market, and for those who are competing, the work requirements are going to be difficult, because they may have no control over their schedules or the amount of money they’re going to be making.”
H.R. 1 imposes a work requirement on adults 55 through 64 and parents with children 14 and older for the first time. It removes exemptions for veterans, people experiencing homelessness and young people who recently aged out of foster care — exemptions that were added in bipartisan legislation in 2023, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. Recipients must now document 20 hours of work per week, participate in a narrow set of work activities or prove they qualify for another exemption.
The bill also ends eligibility for many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. who have been granted humanitarian protection by the federal government, including refugees, people granted asylum and certain survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, a Democrat from Middletown who is co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said he and his colleagues are interested in exploring a state-funded food assistance program. Launching such an initiative would require money and software upgrades to run it, he said.
“At a time when the federal government is increasingly an unreliable partner, it’s important that we maintain the capacity to feed the residents of this state,” Lesser said. “Every week we find out new critical problems with changes in federal policy that are really hammering low-income people, and we have to figure out what the priorities are. I would argue that food, shelter and health care are all key priorities, food probably first among them.”
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, pointed to a $500 million emergency fund authorized during the special session this month as one way to help residents losing access to SNAP.
“This is an example of what the fund could be used for,” he said. “Obviously, the governor has a lot of discretion, and we have to vote on it. If the governor were to come to us and say, ‘I’d like to help out these folks who are getting kicked off SNAP,’ I would support that.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, added: “I would support anything that helps us fill in some of the federal cuts, especially regarding food assistance. … To the extent that there are still gaps and problems with access to needed food, I would certainly be supportive if the governor proposes using some of the money set up in that $500 million fund.”
But Ritter warned that funding the program long-term could be too costly.
“The cuts to H.R. 1, if unchanged, by 2028 are billions of dollars, and the state does not have the ability to cover that. No state will,” he said. “But in the short term, while we see what happens in Washington, we have a fund set up to try to help people through that year.”
A spokesman for Lamont said the governor is still reviewing how to use money in the emergency fund.
“The administration is reviewing how best to utilize the $500 million reserve,” the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, said. “We will be announcing actions in the near future.”
Tong, 21 other attorneys general sue over SNAP eligibility guidance
Attorney General William Tong announced Wednesday that he and 21 other attorneys general are suing the federal government, seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that deems some immigrants ineligible for food assistance even after they become permanent residents.
In October, the USDA issued new guidance to state agencies describing changes to SNAP eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Tong said the memo incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through certain pathways — including refugees, asylum recipients and others — would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents. The attorneys general argue the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose large financial penalties on states.
“The Trump Administration cannot help themselves. They are messing with SNAP benefits again. This time they are inventing their own rules to permanently ban legal immigrants — green card holders — from ever receiving food stamps,” Tong said in a statement. “There is zero basis in the law for this cruel move, and we’re suing to stop them.”

Nutrition experts share dangers of malnutrition, food insecurity
As many families brace for the loss of assistance, nutrition experts and health officials warn of malnutrition concerns and the mental health effects of food insecurity.
When people tighten their budgets, they often go without meat and fresh fruit and vegetables. Many cut down on the number of items they purchase or buy more highly processed foods that are shelf stable and last longer, experts said.
That can lead to iron deficiency, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, thinning of the bones, weakness, hair loss and brittle nails, among other symptoms. In children, it can cause developmental delays, trouble concentrating and behavioral problems.
“Malnutrition is always associated with increased health risks,” said Lora Silver, a registered dietician with Yale New Haven Health. “It’s often associated with an inflammatory state or inflammatory activity.
“We have really clear evidence that malnutrition leads to an increased risk of infections. It impairs our immune function. It also puts us at risk for loss of lean muscle mass, and there’s a host of consequences to that, because it impacts our strength, balance and our ability to avoid falls.”
Some families might lean toward purchasing foods that are calorie-dense to maintain their caloric intake but that aren’t nutrient-dense, experts said. That can lead to conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
“When I was working full-time running a shelter for families experiencing homelessness, this is the part of their budget where they were looking to spend as little as possible so they could maximize what they had for rent,” Tepper Bates said. “What that meant was often, for a family with two small kids, they’re buying a 10-pound bag of white rice and five pounds of the cheapest hamburger meat they can find, and that’s going to be the basis of their food for the week. That is simply not adequate nutrition.”
Health officials say they encourage people to look toward plant-based protein sources, such as beans, legumes and tofu, that might be less costly, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables, particularly those with less additives.
“I don’t ever tell people they shouldn’t be eating canned vegetables, because if that’s what they can afford, canned vegetables are better than no vegetables,” said Diane Bussolini, a registered dietician with Trinity Health of New England. “Frozen and canned are absolutely fine.
“Also, [I recommend] buying fruits that are in season. So right now, that’s not watermelon, peaches or cherries. It’s spending food dollars on things like apples and pears and mandarins that are in season and lower costs.”
Stress and anxiety often accompany food insecurity, health officials said, and while adults may be managing the money and purchases, children also feel the effects.
“We know that children are more aware of what’s going on in their house than sometimes parents realize. Kids recognize they don’t have enough food, or that parents are stressed out,” said Dr. Jody Terranova, a pediatrician and former president of the Connecticut Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “There are some increased awareness and distress in children, some increase in anxiety, and in older children, there’s an increase in depression and suicidal symptoms that has been associated with food insufficiency.”
Representatives of the Connecticut Chapter of AAP issued a statement this month saying maintaining access to SNAP benefits is “critical” for the health and well-being of the state’s children.
“We urge the state of Connecticut to protect all children by prioritizing and ensuring access to essential services — starting with maintaining the food services they need to survive and thrive in school and at home,” they wrote. “Food is essential for health. Regardless of … H.R. 1 provisions, we have a duty to ensure continued access to SNAP.”
Health officials also called for more awareness of the mental health consequences of food insecurity.
“We see news reports on the prevalence of reliance on SNAP, or the prevalence of certain budget cuts and the price of food going up,” Silver said. “I wish we were talking more about some way of measuring worry and anxiety, because there are real health impacts to that, and I think adults and children experience that alike.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

A memo issued this month by Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, says that all refugees admitted between Jan. 20, 2021 and February 20, 2025 will have their applications for permanent residency in the United States paused. It asserts that during those years agencies “potentially prioritized expediency, quantity, and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.”
Maggie Mitchell Salem, the executive director of Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, or IRIS, a New Haven-based resettlement agency, estimated that the reviews could affect about 2,500 people the organization settled between 2021 and 2025. 
Mitchell Salem categorized the review as the latest addition to a long line of new difficulties that refugees will now face. In January, the Trump administration suspended the refugee resettlement program, a move that is being challenged in a lawsuit. 
The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July made refugees ineligible for SNAP benefits, and they will lose eligibility for Medicaid beginning in October 2026. 
“It’s basically telling refugees, ‘Get out,’” said Mitchell Salem. 
The memo casts doubt on the quality of refugee vetting conducted during the Biden years, but Mitchell Salem said the process was comprehensive. 
Refugees to the U.S. have to be reviewed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a government organization or a nonprofit. They then have to go through a screening process and an interview to explain why they left their country and are afraid to go back. Once they have been determined to be refugees, they have to go through a second U.S. security clearance and can then be connected with a resettlement agency. The U.S. can also prioritize certain refugees based on geographic quotas or regional priorities.
“This process is extensive. It’s multiple agencies that someone has cleared through. There are multiple interviews,” said Mitchell Salem. 
The majority of refugees resettled in Connecticut in 2024 came from Syria. A large number also came from Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. 
The Administration for Children and Families, in which the Office of Refugee Resettlement operates, did not return a request for comment. 
Rachel Kornfeld, CEO of Jewish Family Services of Greenwich, which has resettled about 2,000 refugees since 2021, said the worst part of this new policy was the uncertainty that it brought to a group of people who had already lived through war, trauma and persecution. 
“ However their path to the U.S. came to be, it was extremely challenging and tenuous,” she said. “And then to finally be in a place of safety, working toward continued independence and building a life, and then for that to be questioned just when you started to feel comfortable and feel safe is absolutely unimaginable.”  
Kornfeld noted that it was also very difficult for refugees who had gone through trauma to be forced to retell their stories over again to people whom they may not trust. 
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he has not seen any evidence to suggest that State Department officials had applied a lower standard during the Biden years. 
“There is not a scintilla of fact to distinguish the process applied since 2021 from the way it functioned before that date under the previous Trump administration,” Blumenthal said. “These refugees are here legally. There’s no indication they are committing criminal offenses or otherwise deserving of this kind of retroactive review, so it seems eminently unnecessary and wasteful.”
Mitchell Salem said the reviews would also contribute to further delays for people who are trying to get their green cards.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_IRISVigil_262-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Getty Images)The New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department this week announced $390 million in unclaimed property, and urged residents to determine if they have either money or other assets being held by the state.
The state can end up  with unclaimed property through a variety of circumstances, including death, job changes and moves. Such property runs the gamut, from money to uncashed checks to safe deposit box contents and more.
According to a news release, individual claims average $500. So far, this year, Tax and Rev has paid  6,414 claims totaling $18.5 million.
“The Taxation and Revenue Department wants to reunite owners with their lost property,” Taxation and Revenue Department Secretary Stephanie Schardin Clarke said in a statement. “The holiday season can be financially stressful, and there’s no better time to check for unclaimed property to help alleviate some of that stress.”
Search and file claims for property at: nmclaims.unclaimedproperty.com. Those claims can be made online for individuals claiming $500 or less. For those involving multiple owners, businesses or claims over $500, the state says people can submit claims via a PDF form and documentation.
Most claims are processed quickly, the state says, but the department has 90 days from submission to approve or deny it, followed by 30 days to pay it out.

The fund, provided by her parents, Melissa Stanza and Alan Haselhorst, will place an emerging journalist in a yearlong fellowship on the health team at Mississippi Today, beginning in 2026. Application information is available at this link for the fellowship, which offers journalists an immersive experience with the opportunity to report on issues including mental health, maternal health and underserved communities.
Sarah was 31 when she died in 2024 in South Carolina.
She was a native of St. Louis, Missouri and worked in health care before becoming a reporter with a passion for health journalism. She worked at the Clarion Ledger in Jackson from 2021 to 2022, where she covered the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Mississippians and the health care system, among other pressing health topics. 
“Sarah dedicated so much of her energy and effort to shedding light on and sharing the truth about the realities too many Mississippians face when attempting to access health care, including mental health care,” said Laura Santhanam, Mississippi Today’s health editor. “It is our honor to carry her memory forward with this fellowship and to help early-career journalists continue that important work so more people in Mississippi and beyond can get the help they need.”
A graduate of the University of Missouri’s journalism school, Sarah was committed to truth and persistent in her search for it.
And though Sarah was opinionated, “she made such an effort in her reporting to be fair, to not put her perspective in there, and to give everybody a voice,” Stanza said.  
After leaving Mississippi in 2022 and moving to Hilton Head, South Carolina, to report on climate at The Island Packet, Sarah worked on a story about erosion of a barrier island owned by the University of South Carolina. The island was given to the university with the condition it remain untouched, save for the building of a lab, and that it be used for scientific and educational purposes. 
When Sarah was told she couldn’t visit the island as part of her reporting, she pushed back – and got her first inkling that there was more under the surface. 
She kept digging after publishing the first story. She interviewed the family of Philip Rhodes, the owner of Pritchards Island who donated it to the university decades ago. She also visited the island. Her months-long reporting uncovered disrepair and underfunding, in addition to a little known fact: that the deeds associated with the gift stipulated that if the University of South Carolina did not abide by its rules, Pritchards would go to the University of Georgia, Rhodes’ alma mater. 
A year after Sarah reported that story and others about the island, the South Carolina Legislature, with the support of the governor, passed a bill awarding $500,000 a year in recurring funding for Pritchards Island. The money allowed the university to revive its research efforts, which continue to this day.
A rocking chair bearing a plaque now sits on the front porch of the Beaufort College Building on the historic campus of the University of South Carolina-Beaufort. It reads: “In grateful memory of Sarah Yelena Haselhorst whose writing helped save Pritchards Island.”
The reporting by Sarah had the same kind of impact the journalists at Mississippi Today strive to achieve. The fellow will be urged to work in the same spirit as Sarah: to dig deeper, be persistent and uncover the unknown.
Stanza and Haselhorst said their daughter spoke highly of Mississippi Today when she was working in the state. The respect she held for the newsroom led them to fund a fellowship in her honor. 
“Sarah did not give her praise lightly,” Stanza said. “So when she said something was good, she really believed it was good.” 
A note Sarah wrote to readers and friends when she left Mississippi showed how deeply she was touched by her time in the state and the people she met. 
She wrote beautifully of the tragic, including the COVID-19 death of a 13-year-old girl, and the joyful, including the 100th birthday celebration of a Mississippi Delta native.    
“I hiked up to the Delta and saw high cotton, ate barbecue at a 97-year-old staple and met the bravest woman I’d ever spoken with. I went down to Biloxi to lie on the hottest sand my feet had ever encountered. Then ate some damn good fish tacos,” Sarah wrote. “I spent time with nurses, farmers, Freedom Riders, activists, people experiencing homelessness, people with fancy titles and those who were too young to talk.”
She also wrote: “The Delta is more breathtaking than you’d ever imagine. The politics more divisive. The heat and humidity more cloying. But at the crux of it all are the people. Mississippians are gracious. They share. They’re natural-born storytellers. And the people I spoke to on a regular basis craved good change.”
Stanza said Sarah always longed to return to Mississippi and to health journalism.
“It was her dream,” she said. “And in a way, now, she’s doing it.”

The Venezuelan nationals were deported under an obscure wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.“After receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,” according to the DOJ filing. “That decision was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court’s order.”Noem’s decision sent 137 Venezuelan men to a mega-prison for months until the Venezuelan government could broker a prison swap with El Salvador and the United States to have the men returned. In an emergency March 15 order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said the planes carrying the Venezuelans had to return to the United States.They did not have the opportunity to challenge their removal, which was a violation of their due process rights, the American Civil Liberties Union has argued in its case against the Trump administration. Tuesday’s filing represents a shift in legal strategy from the administration, which had initially argued that because Boasberg’s order was verbal and not written, his temporary restraining order carried no weight. Contempt probeThe filing comes after Boasberg resumed a contempt investigation to identify the Trump administration officials involved in authorizing the Venezuelans’ removals.Last week, Boasberg ordered the administration to submit filings on how to proceed with the contempt inquiry.“I certainly intend to find out what happened that day,” Boasberg said last week.Tuesday’s filing argued that contempt proceedings are not needed and that “the Government maintains that its actions did not violate the Court’s order.”The ACLU, which is representing the deported men, in its filing on the contempt issue urged Boasberg to request testimony from nine current and former officials from the Homeland Security and Justice departments. The ACLU also said the government should identify “all individuals involved in the decision… regardless of whether they were the ultimate decision-maker or had direct input into the decision, as well as all those with knowledge of the decision-making process.”Once those people had been identified, Boasberg could determine in what order testimony should be gathered.",,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Alabama’s largest electric utility has proposed delaying an approved rate increase for an extra year amid a public outcry surrounding high utility bills.
Alabama Power customers will still see an increase in bills stemming from the company’s $622 million purchase of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station earlier this year, but not for another year, if the plan is approved by the state’s Public Service Commission.
The rate increase, which Alabama Power said will raise an average customer’s bills by about $3.32 per month, was originally slated to go into effect in January 2027.

“Alabama Power made an informational filing with the Alabama Public Service Commission as part of our ongoing discussions about ways to help customers manage their power bills,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We know budgets are tight, and power bills are a real concern for many families and businesses.”
Alabama Power submitted the proposal in an informational filing with the PSC late last week.
A spokesperson for the PSC said that the proposal will “likely” be presented to the commission at its next regular meeting on Dec. 2.
“The Commissioners could approve the proposal in its current form, offer modifications to the proposal, reject the proposal or table the proposal, pending further information,” the spokesperson said via email. “Either action will require a vote.”
Environmental watchdog groups that follow the PSC cautioned that customers may still see rate increases over the next two years, even if the proposal is approved.
Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that Alabama Power customers’ bills include numerous rate schedules, many of which were not included in the proposal.
“To fully understand the impact of Alabama Power’s proposal, customers deserve full bill transparency, including a breakdown of each rate included in the bill and how much a customer pays for each rate,” Tidwell said in an email. “Without this information, it is difficult to understand how much of the bill will be frozen. In addition, ratepayers deserve a thorough, transparent review of Alabama Power’s proposal to determine whether rates should actually be lowered rather than held steady.”
Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said no costs were being waived, only pushed down the road.
“The fine print shows it’s a deferral strategy, not a reduction,” Tait said. “It’s just a broken attempt to help the utility weather a storm of criticism for its high bills and abnormally high profits.”
Alabama Power’s electric rates have been under scrutiny especially since new data center projects could significantly increase demand in the state for the first time in decades.
An Inside Climate News analysis showed that Alabama Power residential customers paid, on average, the highest total electric bills in the nation, thanks to slightly above average rates and extremely high electricity usage.
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, said on a recent press call that she wanted assurances that the costs of new data centers will not be passed on to customers.
“We have the highest power rates in the Southeast,” Britt said. “I think that is unacceptable.”
Alabama Power has said repeatedly that new data center customers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” including the costs of new infrastructure to meet the demand.
New PSC President Cynthia Lee Almond, appointed earlier this year by Gov. Kay Ivey, published an op-ed highlighting the need to protect Alabama Power customers from rising rates due to data centers.
“Utility bills have spiked in some states as residential and small  business customers subsidize the infrastructure investments needed to accommodate big tech,” Almond wrote. “We have a chance to learn from their challenges and avoid them here. Alabama’s main challenge and my priority is clear: make sure our families and small businesses don’t get stuck with the bill.”
In addition to delaying the rate increase from the Lindsay Hill plant, Alabama Power’s proposal would also lock in environmental compliance costs and the fuel cost factor at current levels through 2027.
The company said to make those commitments, it sought permission from the PSC to apply potential customer refunds next year to its natural disaster reserve fund instead, and to use funds from a federal nuclear production tax credit to offset retail costs.
“The filing outlines commitments aimed at providing more certainty and predictability around electric rates at a time when many other costs are rising,” the company said. “We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the Commission on an issue that matters deeply to customers across Alabama.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lindsay-Hill-Power-Station-for-Nov-26-2025-story-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

HMR has operated the home on behalf of the state since 1998. (Photo courtesy of SC. Department of Veterans Affairs)Caring for South Carolina’s elderly veterans has been one Upstate company’s focus for nearly three decades. A recent state contract will further extend that streak.
Anderson-headquartered HMR Veterans Services operates four of South Carolina’s six nursing homes for veterans.
The company started with the Richard M. Campbell Veterans Nursing Home, located in Anderson and named for the brother of the late former Gov. Carroll Campbell: U.S. Army Sgt. Richard Campbell was killed in action in May 1968 in Vietnam.
HMR has run Campbell’s namesake home since 1998 and will continue to do so through at least February 2033, along with Veterans Victory House in Walterboro. HMR has held contracts on the Lowcountry home since 2007.
For its services at the two homes, HMR will receive an estimated $375 million over seven years, paid by state and federal taxes.
HMR was the lowest bidder of three finalists for contracts starting March 1. In the first year, its rate of $333 per bed per day compared to the high bid of $425 per bed per day, according to documents provided to the SC Daily Gazette in a public records request.
Contracts for two other homes HMR runs — one in Gaffney and one in Florence — are out for bid now.
Outside the Palmetto State, HMR also runs all five of Alabama’s veterans homes and six out of 10 in Texas.
That brings the company’s total to 15 homes with 3,000 employees across three states.
SC’s investment in veterans
In SC, hundreds of veterans go homeless. These groups received state money to help.

For all six homes in South Carolina, taxpayers spend about $80 million annually to collectively care for roughly 800 veterans, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
In a state with 400,000 veterans, the homes always have a waiting list, he said.
Future expansions, including new homes planned for Orangeburg and Horry counties and a replacement of a Columbia home with a newer facility planned for Lexington County, will eventually increase capacity to more than 1,080 veterans.
Gov. Henry McMaster has backed these veterans’ homes in his budget recommendations. That includes a 2024 call for the Legislature to set aside $41 million for the state’s share of the future Lexington facility and $8 million for renovations at existing homes. The Legislature’s final budget last year matched that request.
“The governor believes veterans bring great value to South Carolina,” said his spokesman, Brandon Charochak. “We’re a military friendly state and part of the reason for that are state veterans’ homes.”
The construction timeline of those new homes depends on congressional spending, since federal taxes cover 65% of the cost. South Carolina must kick in the other 35%. Total funding could be five years away, Hilliard said.
A focus on veterans
Operating homes for veterans is the only thing HMR does, which makes the company unique nationwide, Russell Keogler, vice president of corporate operations, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“There are competitors out there, but their main focus is on traditional nursing homes,” Keogler said. “For us, this is all we do and all we do every day.”
That gives HMR an advantage when it comes to meeting the unique needs of veterans, according to Keogler.
HMR has specialists on hand to treat illnesses more common to veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. As Vietnam and Korean War veterans are aging, they are also facing more health complications from exposure to toxins, such as Agent Orange used during the war to remove trees and foliage in the dense jungle battlegrounds.
The House’s chief budget writer, Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, said it makes sense to have specialized homes with staff to meet veteran-specific needs rather than caring for them alongside the rest of the state’s elderly population.
“South Carolina has a very long and proud history of supporting veterans,” said the Greenville Republican. “And we like the idea of taking care of veterans after their service.”
Plus, South Carolina’s military bases are major economic drivers for the state, he said.
Veterans’ homes are just one way lawmakers seek to attract veterans to the Palmetto State or, if they’re here already, keep them and their skills in South Carolina after they retire. Under a 2022 law, military retirees pay no state income taxes on pensions earned for at least 20 years of service.
“If they knew there was a robust veterans home resource, that would be a favorable consideration when thinking about where to spend their retirement years once they’re out (of the military),” Bannister said.
A company history
Still, HMR wasn’t always just a veterans-based company.
Michael McBride, a nursing home administrator, founded it as Health Management Resources, Inc., in 1993, after leasing his first six nursing homes.
Its first veterans’ home, the Campbell facility, became part of the portfolio in 1998, seven years after it opened. That’s also when Army veteran William Biggs, the husband of freshman U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs, joined as CEO. He had been the administrator of the home in Anderson when HMR took over the contract.
At one point, HMR had as many as 27 veteran and non-veteran facilities across five states, according to McBride’s biography on the company website. In 2010, the company sold 21 hospice, rehab and pharmacy locations to a private equity firm but held on to the veterans’ services side of the business.
McBride continues to sit on HMR’s board of directors, as does the widow of another HMR co-founder, Ed Childress.
William Biggs retired and Ladeeb Diab replaced him as CEO in May 2023. Eight months later, Biggs’ wife launched her campaign for the ruby red congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Duncan, who chose not to seek an eighth term. Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner, emerged the winner of a seven-way GOP primary contest in June 2024. Her 3rd District win last November sent two South Carolina women to Congress for the first time ever.
William Biggs declined to comment for this article, citing a noncompete agreement he signed upon retirement that prevents him from speaking about the company.
The congresswoman, in financial disclosures filed last month, reported more than $4 million in income in 2024 from the sale of her husband’s minority interest in HMR businesses.
Members of Congress are required to annually disclose their finances. But they’re only required to report a range of how much their assets and liabilities are worth, so the couple’s exact earnings are unknown. But she valued the capital gains from each of four HMR businesses at more than $1 million.
‘Push the envelope’
Keogler said HMR has sought to “push the envelope” in other ways as well.
For example, at the request of states it contracts with, HMR began running its own pharmacies at its homes, instead of calling in prescriptions from elsewhere.
“We can do all of our medication reviews right in house, and our pharmacists actually know the residents,” he said. “It’s no longer just filling a prescription. It’s taking care of a veteran who you see every day.”
HMR also weathered staffing shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does so through a scholarship program, paying for the education of any certified nursing assistant employed by the company who wants to pursue a higher-level licensed practical nursing degree.
New SC law aims to ensure no veteran dies without proper recognition

“We help cover the cost of their tuition and books. We provide them a mentor to help guide them through the program, all while they can continue to work on this flexed academic schedule that builds professional growth for the individual and provides us a constant source of new nurses,” Keogler said. “I think it’s those innovative practices, which we’ve accelerated over the last two years, that really caught the attention of our state partners.”
A huge cost benefit
There are other reasons South Carolina’s more than 386,000 veterans and their families may choose a veterans home.
“It’s really camaraderie and connection,” Keogler said. “There’s a true brotherhood that exists in the service and that comes out later on in life.”
Also, there’s a huge cost benefit to families when they select a state veterans home. With military service benefits, their cost is far less than that of a traditional nursing home.
The federal government pays states a daily rate which can cover up to 50% of the homes’ operating costs. For veterans deemed at least 70% disabled due to injuries related to their military service, their cost is covered in full, Hilliard said.
The remaining costs are covered by state taxes or by the veterans themselves, said Hilliard, who was previously HMR’s executive vice president of operations. He joined the state agency in April 2024 after it took over the homes’ operations from the state mental health agency.
$71 million nursing home for SC veterans opening in Sumter

Above average
South Carolina also is in the minority of states — one of 13 — that pay private contractors to run all of its homes, though more states are trending that direction, Hilliard said.
While private contractors run the homes, the state public health agency and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are tasked with inspecting them. And the state veterans agency employs someone on site at each home, Hilliard said.
“Our homes consistently perform at or above national averages,” he said.
Three of the four HMR-run homes in South Carolina have recently received high marks.
State and federal regulators inspected the Anderson and Walterboro homes seven times over the past four years. Some reviews were the result of complaints and required the homes to make improvements. But each received a government rating of four out of five stars.
The Gaffney home has gone through four inspections and one improvement plan in that time and has a perfect rating.
The Florence home, however, sits at a two out of five. Federal reports site shortfalls in a handful of patient treatment plans for residents with medical issues including diabetes, a feeding tube and ulcers and bedsores.
The state home in Columbia, which is run by Avalon Health Care Group rather than HMR, also has a two-star rating. The same group also runs the state’s newest veterans’ home in Sumter, which opened in January. It hasn’t been rated yet.

HMR also made headlines in 2018, when the wife of a U.S. Air Force veteran alleged her husband suffered repeat infections, hospitalizations and unexplained bruises while he was in the Walterboro home, the Independent Mail reported.
And in May 2018, HMR settled a $425,000 lawsuit involving a veteran at the Anderson home who had a latex glove lodged in his airway. He died five days later.
Hilliard, who was still working for HMR at the time, told the Independent Mail: “Health care is a very litigious environment. A settlement does not constitute an admission of liability.”
State Department of Public Health investigations around this time found 13 violations involving “policies and procedures, staff training, resident records, resident care and medication administration.” The agency fined HMR $3,600.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RICHARD-M.-CAMPBELL-VETERANS-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

Ned Lamont ended months of controversy and speculation Wednesday when he signed a new version of a bill he vetoed this past summer.,"After months of negotiations and debate, Gov. Ned Lamont has signed a controversial omnibus bill that aims to address Connecticut’s dire lack of affordable housing.
Lawmakers passed House Bill 8002 during the special session earlier this month, and Lamont signed it into law Wednesday morning, after receiving it from the Senate on Tuesday. The bill expands fair rent commissions, eliminates most off-street parking requirements for smaller housing developments and requires towns to create housing growth plans, among other measures.
[What to know about the CT housing bill passed in special session]
Lamont vetoed a similar bill that his office had worked to negotiate in June, after the regular session. The governor said he wanted to see a bill that had more town buy-in and called a two-day special session for earlier this month to give lawmakers time to work on revising the legislation.
After months of negotiations, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns stood alongside Lamont at a press conference a few weeks ago to support the new bill.
“This bill tells mayors and first selectmen ‘What do you want your town to look like in five or 10 years? Start planning accordingly. Where do you want that housing to go? Are you going to zone accordingly? What else do you need? We want to be your partner,’” said Lamont at the press conference.
While some Democratic lawmakers said the negotiated bill wasn’t as strong as the one they originally passed, they think it will go a long way toward addressing the affordable housing need in Connecticut.
Homelessness has increased over the past few years, and rent prices have risen. Most studies estimate the state lacks more than 100,000 units of housing that are affordable and available to its low-income renters.
The bill has sparked fierce opposition from groups that say it weakens local control and puts onerous burdens on towns. Republican lawmakers voted against the bill and criticized the process of passing a bill in special session, which they said did not incorporate enough input from the public.
Lamont is expected to hold a public bill signing next week, said spokesman Rob Blanchard.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0073-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray had reason for optimism when he and other state administrators kicked off their work in November 2024 charting a path to achieving the state’s decarbonization mandates.
“When we first started working on this, Trump hadn’t taken office,” Gray, who heads a consortium of state agencies overseeing the implementation of Rhode Island’s Act on Climate law, said in an interview Wednesday. “We still had very strong federal policies, federal authorities and grants in place. Those three things were really, very important.”

Public comments on the state’s 2025 draft climate action strategy report can be submitted online at https://climatechange.ri.gov/act-climate/public-comment. Supplemental materials are also available online.

On Tuesday, the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council released a draft of its first comprehensive review of existing progress and future forecasting to help achieve the state’s net-zero emissions law. The 31-page report is open for public comment through Dec. 10.
And as Gray wrote in his opening letter, recent shifts in federal policy and funding have eroded his confidence in achieving Rhode Island’s aggressive emissions reduction plan.
“These shifts will have devastating and immediate consequences for Rhode Island’s climate planning,” Gray wrote. “While this Strategy focuses on impacts to our climate-change portfolio, the broader federal rollbacks are poised to trigger severe disruptions across energy, environmental protection, health care, and food-security systems, placing extraordinary strain on state agencies and undermining long-standing strategic investments.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act yanked more than $75 million in federal funding to Rhode Island for clean energy programs and related research and infrastructure projects. Before that, Biden-era federal tax credits for renewable energy were canceled, more stringent state vehicle emissions standards paused and offshore wind projects set to power New England’s grid were halted or pulled back. Even the federal grants for the climate council to hire a consultant to model state emissions output in future years were temporarily frozen. 
“We’re trying to figure out ways to do this without necessarily direct monetary incentives everywhere,” Gray said.
Asked what alternative, nonfinancial incentives might be, Gray responded “I don’t know. That’s what we’re working through.”
And yet, Rhode Island still must meet the legally binding mandate to reduce carbon emissions, with the first benchmark in 2030.  
“Rhode Island will forge ahead in the face of this shifting landscape and continue to collaborate across all agencies in 2026 and beyond,” the report states.
The council is charged with updating its assessment in subsequent reports issued every five years through the 2050 deadline for completion.

Establishing the goal line 
As of 2023 — the most recent data available — Rhode Island produced 9.52 million metric tons of carbon, 19.5% less than the 1990 levels used as a baseline, according to data collected and analyzed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The emissions inventory report published last week stressed the need to accelerate incentives and policies that promote a clean energy transition, warning that the existing pace of progress was not enough to meet the first incremental benchmark in 2030. 
However, according to the climate council’s models, Rhode Island will meet the 2030 benchmark, which calls for reducing total emissions 45% from the 1990 baseline. This is largely thanks to state incentive programs and policy choices, such as discounts for property owners to switch to heat pumps, weatherize and make their homes energy efficient, and buy or lease battery-powered and hybrid cars, the report stated.
But achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 remains just of reach without “additional ambition,” the council’s draft strategy report states. The report outlines broad steps to speed up the clean energy transition, targeting the biggest culprits of carbon emissions: transportation, home heating and electricity use.
“We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is,” Gray said of the strategy report. 










We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is. 


– Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray


In order to achieve the 2050 net-zero mandate, for example, Rhode Island needs to accelerate its adoption of hybrid and battery-powered vehicles, including cars, trucks, and off-road sources like boats and airplanes. Specifically, the report recommends nearly tripling annual electric vehicle sales, from the 13,000 sold this year in the state to 36,000 by 2030.
Gray is eyeing the transportation sector with extra concern, noting that Trump has sought to repeal federal waivers letting states, including Rhode Island, adopt more stringent vehicle emissions standards. 
Much of Rhode Island’s ability to achieve reductions in transportation sector emissions relies on its authority to set lower emissions standards for new cars and trucks. 
“Especially when we look beyond 2030, we have a significant challenge in reducing transportation emissions,” Gray said.
Federal rollbacks have not cooled the state’s incentive program to help property owners convert from oil or gas to electric-powered heat pumps. But surging winter electricity prices have dissuaded some heat pump converts from using their new systems, Gray said. 
“We need stability and certainty in electric rates so people actually use their heat pumps,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the heat is on to keep selling these greener home heating alternatives. 
Every home and business in Rhode Island must have a heat pump installed by 2050 to meet the decarbonization mandate, per report modeling. Achieving this overhaul requires increasing heat pump sales from the 3,000 sold in 2025 to 15,000 a year by 2030, according to the report.

Sticker shock 
Convincing cash-strapped consumers and business owners to look to long-term savings versus the upfront costs of a hybrid car or heat pump conversion is not easy, Gray acknowledged. Cost was a top concern cited by residents in a series of community meetings organized by the climate change council this fall.
“There’s got to be more hesitancy now to say ‘where is this all going’ given the rhetoric coming out of the federal government,” Gray said.
But there is also a price for doing nothing — $940 million in “social costs” by 2050, according to the report.
“Decarbonization reduces spending on fossil fuels, avoids the economic and health damages caused by climate change, and delivers cleaner air and healthier communities across the state,” the report states. 
Going green will also boost the state economy, adding an estimated 6,500 jobs by 2035 for work on offshore wind projects, battery storage and residential heating and cooling, the report states. 
The report concludes with a call to action. 
“The decarbonization and transition of our economy must be done carefully, and deliberately with affordability in mind, to meet the goals set forth in the Act on Climate,” it states. “It is important to emphasize that acting on climate change cannot be championed by state government alone. Businesses, municipalities, nonprofit leaders and residents will continue to be called up to prioritize action towards the goals of the Act on Climate.”

(Courtesy of Matt Cashore for the Kishla Askins campaign)OMAHA — Navy veteran Kishla Askins received an endorsement of her 2026 bid for the Democratic nomination in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District from a left-leaning organization that supports veterans who run for office. 
VoteVets, which endorsed Askins, is considered a major player in some Democratic primary races. Recently two candidates backed by the organization won their gubernatorial race, former Navy helicopter pilot Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and former CIA officer Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. 
Travis Tazelaar, VoteVets Political Director, said, “Veterans remain the best-positioned candidates to make crucial flips.”
“We know there is no path to flipping the House without veteran candidates running and winning in districts that other Democrats can’t compete in,” Tazelaar said “We’re excited to be behind Kishla’s campaign and to help her across the finish line.”

Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District is a crucial race for national Democratic hopes to retake the House in 2026. Democrats feel optimistic with Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring. 
Askins is a part of a national Democratic strategy of promoting veterans to run in battleground districts in next year’s midterms as a throwback to a strategy that helped Democrats win control of the House in 2018.  She said she was proud to have “VoteVets by my side as we fight for the future Nebraskans deserve.” 
“From leading missions in Iraq and in support of Afghanistan, to serving at the Department of Veterans Affairs, to now running to represent Nebraskans in Congress, I’ve dedicated myself to a life of service,” Askins said.
Askins still has to navigate a primary with other Democratic candidates with higher name ID and more local ties. 
She is in a Democratic primary with business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and former immigration attorney Evangelos Argyrakis.
The winner of the Democratic May 12 primary will face the winner of a GOP primary featuring Omaha City Council Member Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha.

Here's what to know.","When Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam announced the pause of state-funded renovations for six public schools in September, the decision surprised the Board of Education and the Hartford School Building Committee.
They had voted in favor of the renovations, along with the City Council, to Moylan Elementary, Parkville Community, McDonough Middle, S.A.N.D, Maria C. Colon Sanchez Elementary and Batchelder schools. 
And state funding was already approved.
School renovations were part of an effort to bring Hartford residents back to study in the district. Over the past four years approximately 5,000 students moved out of the city, with many relocating to places like New Britain, East Hartford, and Manchester, according to an analysis of student enrollment trends by Caitlin Richard, chief financial officer of Hartford Public Schools, shown at a Board of Education meeting in November.
The district faces a projected budget deficit of approximately $30 million, which Richard said would be addressed if more Hartford children attended Hartford Public Schools.
Here’s what we know about the pause on school renovations.
Why did Hartford public schools plan renovations?
The projects were meant to address long-standing issues in Hartford Public Schools’ buildings including leaking roofs and outdated HVAC systems and to incorporate state-of-the-art facilities. Board of Education Chair Shonta Browdy says the lack of updated facilities push away Hartford residents to districts that already provide these.
Renovations aim to address current low enrollment in Hartford’s public schools.
What is the school construction process and at what point was it paused?
It is a long process that includes multiple stakeholders who propose, oversee and approve school construction renovation projects.
First, the school district identifies the need for renovations. Consultants and other professionals may be involved with the documentation process, considering student enrollment, building needs and academic programs.
Then the Board of Education prepares educational specifications of project costs and eight-year enrollment figures. Once the city approves those, the board and the City Council are authorized to submit a grant application to the state, and the Office of School Construction Grants & Review evaluates the proposal.
If the proposal is approved — like it was in the case of the six public schools in Hartford — the state issues a grant letter of commitment. The city’s school building committee further hires program and construction managers, and architects. 
Next, before bidding for the construction work begins, which is authorized by the state’s school construction office, designs are made, reviewed and approved. Construction then is supposed to start.
The projects were paused near the very end of the process. Construction companies already had bid and a design request for proposal for the schools was voted on by the Hartford School Building Committee.
Here are the names of the chosen construction companies, according to information provided by Browdy:

S.A.N.D has a contract with Colliers;
Sanchez Elementary and Batchelder schools with Arcadis and O&G;
McDonough Middle with PDS Engineering and Construction Inc.;
Parkville Community with 7 Summits Construction;
and Moylan Elementary with Newfield Construction.

What does the mayor say about his reasoning for pausing the school renovations?
Cristian Corza-Godinez, city of Hartford spokesperson, said in a written statement that “the status quo” is not working for students, and so the mayor is working on a 5-year plan to turn schools into centers of excellence. He said that requires conversations around whether the city is stretching resources too thin in under-enrolled schools. 
Corza-Godinez said that until the city has a plan to address this, pausing school construction is the responsible decision. 
“If we use state dollars to carry out these six construction projects, Hartford taxpayers will be on the hook for twenty years and will have to pay back those dollars if any of those six schools move in a different direction over the next two decades,” he said.
At the school building committee meeting on Oct. 20, Lori Mizerak, the city’s corporation counsel, stated that she sent a memo on Oct. 17 about what the city plans to do to evaluate all city schools facing budgeting issues. The memo is not publicly available.
What are the next steps for these projects moving forward?
As of now, the renovations are on pause and there is not a set date for them to resume construction.
Arulampalam said the city wants to resume construction as quickly as it can, and he hopes that all the parties will come to the table collaborate on a plan that provides better educational outcomes for Hartford students, so that they can offer not just better looking buildings, but also “substantially better education.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 11:58:32.655453

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Caitlynn Belliveau made a comfortable salary as a human resources specialist at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Sioux Falls — enough to support her four children and husband as the sole income earner and make the mortgage payments on their Worthing house.
But when the Trump administration offered her a buyout — officially called a deferred resignation — she took it, receiving four months of paid leave in exchange for quitting her job. She feared she could lose her job abruptly later if she didn’t accept.
After those payments stopped, Belliveau applied for food assistance.


From insiders to ousted
This is the third of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


She finally started work as an educational support professional for the Sioux Falls School District this month after over a dozen interviews in the last three months went nowhere in what she called a “hellscape of a job market.” More than a million workers have been laid off across the country this year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, making this year the worst for layoff notices since 2009.
Within that number are the roughly 154,000 federal employees who took deferred resignations offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Fox Business in August he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
While Belliveau is working in the school district, she’s also working toward her second master’s degree in teaching (her first master’s was in higher education administration) in hopes of improving her prospects. She’s considering moving out of the state or country in hopes of finding better employment.
The 38-year-old is struggling to figure out the best path forward to support her family.
“Federal workers have families and mortgages and need to eat and pay bills,” she said.
While the Trump administration has described its actions as dismantling bureaucracy, Belliveau disputes that characterization.
“We’re not dismantling bureaucracy,” she said. “We’re laying people off. No other company could lay off hundreds of thousands of people without the public being up in arms. It’s crazy to me that this is being celebrated or something they’re proud about.”
The Trump administration’s cuts and layoffs “waged war on federal employees,” she said, and will hurt taxpayers.
“The bureaucracy will remain, but there will be fewer people who know how to navigate that bureaucracy,” Belliveau said.
Belliveau had planned to retire from her federal career. She is a subject matter expert on employee and labor relations. Getting rid of people like her opens up agencies to liability, she said, since it takes years to become an expert on such “incredibly complicated and delicate” subjects.
“You have supervisors who are used to having someone like myself saying, ‘You can’t do that because of this law, regulation or section in a master agreement,’” Belliveau said. “It will cost us more.”

Family, arts community remember ‘shining light’ who believed theatre could change a child’s life
WILMINGTON, Del. — Marie Swajeski, founder of the Delaware Children’s Theatre and a pioneering force in Delaware’s arts community for more than five decades, has died, her family announced yesterday.
The news was shared in a Facebook post by her daughter, Donna Marie Swajeski, who now serves as artistic director of the Delaware Children’s Theatre and has carried on her mother’s mission to bring live theatre to young audiences.
“Our beloved mother and founder of the Delaware Children’s Theatre, Marie Swajeski has peacefully passed this morning,” Donna wrote. “Marie touched so many lives and hearts. She was a shining light in our community and will never be forgotten. As her children, we are shattered, but are so proud to have had her with us for the time we had.”
Funeral information will be announced later, the family said, but a memorial gathering at the theatre is planned so friends, former cast members and audience families can come together to remember her. In lieu of flowers, the family requested donations to her “cherished Delaware Children’s Theatre.”
The Delaware Children’s Theatre on Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington, Delaware, was founded by Marie Swadeski.
A life spent building theatre for children
Swajeski founded what was then the Children’s Repertory Theatre in the early 1970s with a simple but ambitious vision: to introduce children to the performing arts and spark a lifelong love of theatre and music.
Rehearsing at first in basements and garages, she built a touring company that brought professional-quality productions to schools, parks, hospitals, retirement communities and nursing homes across Delaware. In its first decade, the company staged more than 700 performances for more than 90,000 children, earning critical praise and a loyal following among families.
Her belief, colleagues often said, was that any child in the audience—or on stage—might have their life changed by what they experienced at the theatre.
In the early 1980s, Marie and her husband, John, bought the historic New Century Club building on Delaware Avenue, saving it from demolition and transforming it into the permanent home of what became the Delaware Children’s Theatre. The Victorian theatre house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has remained both an arts hub and a preserved historic landmark under the Swajeskis’ care.
Honors and impact
Over the years, Swajeski’s work drew recognition well beyond Wilmington. In 2004, then-U.S. Sen. Tom Carper had September 18 proclaimed “Marie Swajeski Day” and entered the tribute into the Congressional Record, honoring her decades of service to children and the arts.  She was inducted into the Hall of Fame of Delaware Women in 2019 for her lifelong contributions to theatre and youth.
Under her leadership, Delaware Children’s Theatre became a launching pad for countless young performers, including future Tony Award winner John Gallagher Jr., who first appeared there as Tom Sawyer.
The theatre has staged a wide range of productions, from classics such as Charlotte’s Web to big family favorites like Shrek the Musical, along with original works written by Donna, including the Snow White musical One Magic Kiss that premiered at DCT.
Legacy carried on by her children
Today, Delaware Children’s Theatre is led by Marie’s children, Donna and David Swajeski. Donna, an Emmy-winning television writer and longtime artistic director, oversees programming and original works, while David works to preserve and maintain the historic theatre building.
That made Donna’s Facebook tribute especially poignant to many in the arts community, who see her as the standard-bearer of her mother’s legacy.
“Marie touched so many lives and hearts,” Donna wrote. “She was a shining light in our community and will never be forgotten.”
The Delaware Children’s Theatre continues to offer affordable, family-focused productions, workshops and outreach programs, reflecting Marie Swajeski’s enduring belief that the arts can build confidence, imagination and community for every child who walks through its doors.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Swajeskis.webp,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

While the Montana Secretary of State touted “only one percent” of ballots rejected due to missing or mismatched birth year, the individual county statistics show a different story, adding extra costs and labor to counties across the state as they worked to resolve the rejected ballots. 
“663 rejected ballots is definitely an uptick,” said Flathead County Election Administrator Debbie Pierson, pointing out that the voters of Flathead County reduced the number of rejected ballots due to signature mismatch by 50% when compared to the school district election that took place earlier this year. 
“The city council election only had 198 ballots rejected due to signature versus 391 due to signature rejection in the school board race,” Pierson said. “Most of our increase (in rejected ballots) this time came from birth year.” 
“The law requires us to reach out to every person whose ballot is rejected in the most expedient method possible,” explained Missoula County Deputy Elections Administrator Nathan Coyan. “And so what we do to cover everyone is every person whose ballot is rejected gets a letter at the very least.”
Of Missoula County’s initial 1,090 rejected ballots, 694 (64%) were due to errors in birth year, costing the county an additional $513 on letters sent to voters. In Gallatin County, 76% of their initial 820 rejected ballots were due to birth year, costing the county an additional $463 on letters. Yellowstone County spent $851 on letters due to the same issue and Flathead County spent $215. In total, counties across Montana spent a little more than $2,600 on letters to voters whose ballots were rejected due to birth year. 
Some counties, like Lewis and Clark, ran an early information campaign ahead of the general election, using the primary election as an opportunity to give voters a test-run with the new ballot requirement. 
Lewis and Clark County Elections Division Supervisor Connor Fitzpatrick explained there were two parts to their strategy: First, a “soft launch,” where voters received inserts with new instructions in their ballot packets explaining the birth year requirement, as well as a ballot following the new template sent out by the Secretary of State that voters would use in November general election. 
“We weren’t checking birth year for September because it wasn’t in play yet,” explained Fitzpatrick. “But we wanted to get them visually used to the thing. We were like, ‘Hey, that is going to kick into place Oct. 1.’”
The second step was a mailer sent to each address involved in the election for the city of Helena and the city of East Helena. 
“That was sent strategically a week before ballots were mailed out,” said Fitzpatrick.
The total cost of the campaign was $2,020.48, and resulted in Lewis and Clark having one of the lowest rejected ballot rates among larger counties in the state, at only 0.97%. 
  Staff Labor 

In addition to letters and early campaigns to notify voters of the upcoming changes, were supplementary staff costs that many counties found difficult to estimate. 
“It took me all day, all of my days, from when we started,” said Cascade County Elections Specialist Gretchen Yowell. “I did them in batches and I would call daily, and go through every single thing they (the voters) had ever given us to try to contact them.”
Cascade County initially had 547 rejected ballots, 305 (56%) due to birth year. They resolved all rejected ballots but 309.
“We filtered them out by what was missing so we could see what was missing first. Birth year was the first thing I could tackle, and then we could specify signature mismatches. And once the birth year was verified we sent them back through the process,” explained Yowell. “And it takes a minute, because everything has to go into the system, so that way if someone goes on the SOS website they can see it has been rejected.”
Missoula County couldn’t estimate the exact cost, but Coyan reported the effort to resolve ballots took up the majority of staff time. 
“It became the project that everyone was working on,” said Coyan. “Anyone who was available got pulled into it. Even I was working on it. It was crazy.” 
Yellowstone County Elections Administrator Dayna Causby estimated additional staff costs at $3,500, but emphasized this was only for temporary workers and didn’t include the time full-time staff spent away from their usual designated tasks to focus on resolving rejected ballots.
“That was one of the main reasons that we decided to use a ballot drop-off location, because of the birth year requirement and trying to reduce the number of ballots that were rejected,” said Causby. “You were hoping that you could catch people as they were dropping it off and point out the birth year is missing.”
Of Yellowstone County’s initial 1,381 rejected ballots, 1150 (83%) were due to birth year errors. All but 624 ballots were resolved, with 473 (76%) of those remaining due to birth year. 
Counties with smaller municipal elections utilized local connections to contact voters whose ballots had been rejected. Sweetgrass County, for example, had 35 rejected ballots, 31 (89%) due to birth year, but were able to reach most people by phone, ending with only six unresolved ballots. 
Treasure County, which had 20 ballots initially rejected, all due to birth year, ended with all ballots resolved. 
“Through friends and family and the phonebook we were able to get them all in here and write their birth year on the ballot. I was even able to get ahold of someone’s grandmother to get them in,” said Treasure County Elections Administrator Dani Erickson. “Our citizens are really good about it. They answer the phone and come in right away.”

Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, claimed the bill was a “cleanup bill,” the purpose of which was, “To make sure our elections are more secure while maintaining accessibility for voters. By adding an additional verification step we can help prevent fraud, reduce clerical errors and ensure every legally cast vote is counted correctly.” 
Yet ensuring every legally cast vote is counted is exactly what the law may have prevented. 
Even in Ravalli County, Elections Administrator Regina Plettenberg, who testified in support of HB 719 in February of this year, claimed there was no marked increase in the number of ballots rejected, yet confirmed 47% of Ravalli County’s remaining unresolved ballots were due to errors in birth year. 
The largest cost to Montana taxpayers however, may still be adding up.
A lawsuit brought by Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana in May of this year claims the new law disenfranchises elderly and disabled voters. Should Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana be successful in their lawsuit, it will add to the ever expanding demand on Montana taxpayers. 
“The state has spent millions in taxpayer dollars on litigation costs defending unconstitutional bills passed by the legislature,” said Heather O’Loughlin, Executive Director of the Montana Budget and Policy Center. “Not only do these laws create barriers to voting, they also add significant costs to the state.”
In every session, the Legislature passes supplemental appropriations in House Bill 3 which covers unexpected state agency costs accrued in the previous two fiscal years. Lawmakers also pass HB 2 every session – the General Appropriations Act – which adjusts the state’s budget going forward for the next two years. 
The 2025 Supplemental Appropriations Bill allocated $4.1 million for Legal Services, including $2.8 million specifically designated for litigation related to constitutional challenges from bills passed during the 2023 legislative session. 
The 2025 General Appropriations Act increased the Department of Justice budget by $24.2 million for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, with $2 million of that 8% increase specifically designated for the litigation of Montana legislation. 
Elections officials stressed the security of the existing voting process already in place before the passage of HB 719.
“There are already two unique numbers on your affirmation envelope that we utilize to look voters up and to verify signatures and to accept their ballots,” said Causby, in Yellowstone County. “One is a unique number specifically for that ballot for this election. The other number is the voter’s voter ID number. Then of course we have the signature.” 
A point echoed by Coyan, in Missoula County. 
“The signature is a very unique identifier,” said Coyan. “Adding the date of birth does not increase any security, it only adds an additional burden to the voter. People are receiving these ballots at their own request only because they are an active, eligible elector. There’s no need for us to have that date of birth on there.
“When we go from a small handful of rejected ballots in an election to massive piles of them, clearly something has changed for the voter. And it doesn’t look like for the better.”
The Secretary of State has not shared data supporting their claims of “one percent” rejection rate of ballots due to birth year or responded to multiple requests for comment from the Daily Montanan. 
  Another election wrinkle 

In addition to House Bill 719, little known House Bill 207, sponsored by Rep. Jodee Etchert, R-Billings also went into effect this year, changing the election deadline for candidate filings. The changes took place in the middle of the filing window, forcing many candidates to refile, or in the case of Walkerville Ward 1 Alderperson, causing candidates to miss the new deadline altogether, leaving them registered as write-in candidates only. 
“They thought they were on time, but the law changed. So they were late,” said Silver Bow County Elections Administrator Cindy Sherman. “It made it a write-in only election, which makes for a very hard election.”
Silver Bow County had no rejected ballots for the race, but of the 180 ballots mailed out, only 31 (17%) were returned. 
“I think a lot of people just didn’t know what they were supposed to do with that ballot. People want to see a name so they can check a box,” explained Sherman. “Of those 31 ballots, 15 voted for the winning candidate. Three voted for the other candidate. 10 voted for somebody else, a non-declared person, and then three of them were actually unvoted. They filled in the oval, but they didn’t write anything in the line.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JennaMartin-00159-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s most powerful state legislator introduced legislation Tuesday to weaken the powers of a state watchdog agency whose reports on government corruption, waste, and fraud have embarrassed and irritated public officials around the state.
The bill by Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who is the Senate president, would hand the investigatory powers currently held by the state comptroller to the State Commission of Investigation. Officials targeted by the comptroller and groups including the New Jersey Association of Counties have pushed for a probe of the office, complaining about its practices in publicizing its findings.
While the bill says the comptroller’s office would be able to continue its “core work … unabated,” the office would be stripped of its investigative and subpoena powers. That means it could audit public agencies but couldn’t investigate wrongdoing or compel reforms.
A state watchdog forges ahead, in an era of endangered oversight

A public hearing on the bill is set for 10 a.m. Monday before the Senate’s state government committee at the Statehouse in Trenton. Lawmakers often use the brief lame-duck session between November’s election and January’s start of a new legislative session to fast-track controversial bills.
Scutari did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday, but his bill characterizes its goal as “eliminating duplication among State government oversight entities.”
“The investigations operations of the Office of the State Comptroller is smaller than, and different from, its main responsibilities, which are Medicaid fraud, procurement oversight, and audit functions.  Transferring the investigations function to the State Commission of Investigation does not curtail those responsibilities and is a more logical fit that will capitalize on its experience and success,” the bill says.
Kevin Walsh, the office’s acting comptroller, doesn’t buy that explanation.
“NJ ‘transparency’ at its worst. Sen. Scutari sneaks in a bill before Thanksgiving to kill OSC investigations. A vote for this bill is a vote for corruption,” Walsh wrote on social media Tuesday night.
The plan has also sparked outrage among critics who have long lamented that New Jersey doesn’t have enough watchdogs to keep up with all its corruption.
Attorney General Matt Platkin said on social media that he would testify against the bill Monday.
“This Thanksgiving, the NJ Senate is killing a gov’t watchdog that stops wasteful spending, giving politically powerful individuals broad powers to intimidate law enforcement fighting corruption & even letting them tap phones. Outrageous,” Platkin wrote.
The comptroller’s office formed in 2010. Since Walsh became acting comptroller in January 2020, his supporters have praised him as New Jersey’s leading watchdog on police accountability, government waste and fraud, and other issues involving taxpayer money and public misconduct.
His work has irked public officials at nearly every level of government though, and senators have blocked his confirmation. He has said his work is bound to “upset powerful people,” underscoring the need for his office to remain independent.
Scutari’s bill also would more than double State Commission of Investigation commissioners’ annual salary, from $35,000 to $75,000. The agency now has three commissioners and an executive director, although it’s supposed to have four commissioners by law.
It would also take the power to appoint the State Commission of Investigation’s chair away from the governor and give it to the Senate president and Assembly speaker.
A commission spokesperson, executive director Bruce P. Keller, and John P. Lacey, its chair, did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment.
Keller told the Asbury Park Press this month that he does not support eliminating government watchdogs.
“There’s plenty of work to go around,” Keller told the newspaper. “So if your question is a version of the thing that we’ve all heard – which is, are there too many watchdog agencies – my answer is, hell no, there aren’t enough.”

But most of the questions still have to clear several hurdles before making it onto the ballot.  
A major potential obstacle, one that has tripped up several would-be ballot referendums in recent years, is a court challenge that questions whether the measure, as crafted by proponents, can legally go before voters. 
In 2024, Massachusetts stared down six potential ballot measures, four of which consumed the time of the Supreme Judicial Court for months and pushed a critical ruling on controversial state housing policy off to the next year.  
Now the state could be heading toward an even messier collision of legal, legislative, and political forces. 
As the secretary of state’s office certifies hundreds of thousands of signatures submitted on behalf of the proposed 2026 ballot questions, campaigns and ballot initiative veterans estimate about half of the questions could be vulnerable to legal challenges, though not all may materialize.  
It sets up a busy next year of stress testing through courts assessing whether measures are appropriate for the ballot, lawmakers weighing whether to preempt questions through compromise legislation, and campaigns shifting into high gear to make their case to voters. Housing policy, taxes, and government transparency are among the issues that hang in the balance. 
Attorney General Andrea Campbell certified 44 potential questions earlier this year, and 11 campaigns confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon last week that they had secured enough signatures to clear the first threshold, sending the signatures to the secretary of state’s office for certification. 
Massachusetts ballot campaigns that submit 74,574 certified signatures to the secretary of state’s office by December 3 will then be sent to the Legislature in January. While lawmakers consider whether to act on the ballot proposals, several may head for lengthy court fights.  
Because ballot measures are blunt instruments, allowing voters only a yes or no vote, the questions cannot include separate and unrelated provisions. Other restrictions on ballot measures include petitions relating to the courts or judiciary, specific municipalities, certain parts of the state constitution, and some fiscal policy matters. 
One measure is already on the road to legal challenge, though opponents usually wait to file with the court until the early months of the election year. Business and landlord groups are agitating against a ballot question that would impose statewide rent control, limiting annual rent increases to the rate of inflation. 
This measure would permit an uncompensated taking of private property, which is not an appropriate matter for a ballot question, the conservative Fiscal Alliance Foundation argued in an objection to the attorney general’s certification. 
Real estate industry groups told CommonWealth Beacon that they also would be considering taking the rent control matter to the high court. 
“This is something we are taking very, very seriously,” said Tamara Small, chief executive of industry group NAIOP Massachusetts. “So we are looking at this from every single angle. If we believe that there is a court challenge, that’s something we’d certainly pursue.” 
Greg Vasil, CEO of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, said, “We’re doing everything that we can to minimize the risk to the members. This is uncharted territory on the legal side, so we have to look at every opportunity available to us.” 
In recent cycles, the state’s high court has struck several potential ballot measures for flunking the so-called relatedness test.  
In 2018, a first crack at what became the “millionaires tax,” or Fair Share Amendment, was broomed by the court for including too many unrelated provisions. Another version of the measure survived a court challenge four years later and was passed by voters into law.  
The SJC heard challenges to four measures proposed for the 2024 ballot, with three on “relatedness.” 
Those disputes swallowed months. When Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued Milton over the MBTA Communities housing law in February 2024, the SJC didn’t schedule oral arguments until October. The delay stemmed partly from the court’s ballot measure workload, justices said. Since opinions are generally issued about three months after oral arguments, a critical deadline for the housing law passed while justices deliberated. 
Along with the brewing challenge to the rent control question, Andrew Farnitano, a strategist working on several campaigns, expects organized opposition to form if two tax-related ballot measures move forward, which could find its way to the courts. 
The Massachusetts Opportunity Alliance is heading up ballot question campaigns to reduce the income tax and limit the amount of money Beacon Hill can collect and keep when revenues hit a certain threshold. Both would send shockwaves into the state budgeting process as officials work to fund health care, transportation, and other areas during a period of federal funding threats. 
Opponents of a measure that would roll back the legalization of recreational cannabis – itself a ballot referendum almost a decade ago – are focusing their ire on claims of misleading signature gathering practices for now. Depending on whether the secretary of state’s office certifies the group’s signatures, the cannabis industry may pursue legal challenges down the line or focus on defeating the measure on the ballot. 
For the 2026 cycle, Secretary of State William Galvin is not only responsible for overseeing the ballot referendum process as the state’s chief election official, he’s leading one of the ballot question campaigns. Galvin is pushing a ballot measure legalizing Election Day voter registration. 
For any would-be ballot question, the Legislature has a certain window of time in which they can simply pass the measure into the law, preempting a ballot showdown.  
Lawmakers are not responding eagerly to the workload. 
Proponents say the jump in ballot measures, which would eclipse the previous nine-question record, signals disillusionment with the Legislature, which they say refuses to take up issues that have popular support when filed as bills. Legislative leaders instead decry it as a sign of intrusion into their work by special interests. 
“Forty-four of them is a huge number of ballot questions. It makes you wonder: How easy is it for these special interest groups to go out and pay someone to get signatures?” House Speaker Ron Mariano said this week, referring to the original number of questions that were filed. “They design questions that support their topics or their personal interests.” 
The signature-gathering process whittled the number of potential measures by three-fourths, but the Speaker said he wondered if the Massachusetts ballot system will start to look like California’s. Voters in the Golden State, well known for its penchant for lawmaking by ballot question, considered 11 statewide measures in 2024, plus specific municipal- and county-level questions. 
The Legislature has until the first Wednesday in May if it wants to simply enact the ballot measure as written. Lawmakers last cycle created a new special committee to hold hearings and consider legislative action on the eight measures. They ultimately decided, as the high court deliberated, not to recommend legislative action on any of the ballot questions.  
Ballot campaigns are marathons of public and private negotiations, and a flurry of challenges would slow the regular work of the courts and the Legislature alike, but horse-trading can last until the final signature submission deadline in July.  
The final stretch can be a nail-biter — the SJC didn’t hand down its final word on the challenged ballot measures until June last cycle, just in time for one of the most controversial questions of the season to decide against going before voters because of a settlement in a completely different court case. 
If the Legislature decides not to act, and the courts allow the measures to head toward the ballot, proponents and opponents battle it out on the campaign trail.  
For some questions, though, an organized opposition seems unlikely to form.  
Ballot efforts to subject the governor’s office and the Legislature to public records laws and to rein in legislative stipends both go after the insular ways of Beacon Hill – something generally popular with voters and unlikely to draw organized opposition. A recent Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found more than 80 percent of respondents would support the public records change. 
These efforts carry a strong echo of state Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s successful ballot campaign last year seeking to audit the Legislature and, not coincidently, the crusading auditor has now turned her focus to leading the public records campaign.

Kennedy Jr., speaking here at a September event, reportedly ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to update a website page to add disproven information about autism and its causes. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A new page on a federal government website that provides inaccurate information about vaccines and autism is concerning to Kansans who work in autism research.
A majority of studies and researchers say there is no connection between autism and vaccinations, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated a page to share contradictory information.
“The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism,” the site says.
The page was updated last week, and in an interview with the New York Times, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, said he instructed the CDC to change the information.
“The information posted on the CDC website unfortunately contains multiple inaccurate or misleading statements,” said Matt Mosconi, director of the Kansas Center for Autism Research and Training. “The CDC message ignores many studies that have been conducted on this topic. And, my expectation is that this statement is confusing for individuals and families, and it has strong potential to be harmful.”
The Coalition of Autism Scientists, which Mosconi and other researchers at K-CART belong to, published a statement saying the harm caused by questioning the safety of childhood vaccines cannot be overstated.
“By altering and distorting the evidence on vaccine safety, the CDC can no longer be relied on to provide the public with accurate information,” the statement said.
Mosconi said if there had been evidence that vaccines caused autism, scientists would have followed that evidence.
“Rigorous study after rigorous study failed to find that link, so we, as scientists, follow the data to identify those factors that are associated with autism and do have potential to be informative for supporting the autism community,” he said.
Kathryn Unruh, an assistant researcher at K-CART, said the new information presented on the CDC site is concerning for several reasons, including whether people will hesitate to vaccinate their children.
Kansas has seen vaccination rates for kindergarteners drop in many areas across the state. The state also had a measles outbreak, which has since ended.
“As an autism researcher, we are also quite concerned with how this may misdirect attention as well as the critical funding we may need for studies that will support autistic individuals and their families,” Unruh said.
Two “very large” and rigorous studies have shown no association between autism and vaccinations, she said. The studies were well-controlled and had large samples. The initial and since discredited study that started the misinformation about vaccines and autism included just 12 children, Unruh said.
A 2002 Danish study included more than 500,000 children and looked at the risks of developing autism in children who were vaccinated and unvaccinated. The study controlled for multiple variables, including the age at which children received vaccines, their gestational age, birth weight and their economic status, Unruh said.
No connection was found between autism and vaccinations in that study.
Another large study in the United States also looked at familial factors because of the high likelihood of developing autism if the individual has a sibling with autism, Unruh said.
“Even if kids already had one likelihood factor for developing autism, they also found no increased association with developing autism and vaccines in those children,” she said.
The information being put out by the CDC on its official website worries Unruh.
“As a scientist, I’m quite concerned that they have ignored decades of rigorous research, including multiple studies that use CDC data,” she said. “On their own website, an archived page now, they do have a long list of studies that they have documented that show no association between vaccines and risk for developing autism.”
Scientific studies have shown a genetic component to autism and other studies have looked at environmental interactions that might increase the risk for autism, Unruh said.
A 2015 study published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, researched possible connections between children who have a genetic likelihood of developing autism — identified because siblings had autism — and vaccinations causing them to develop autism, she said.
That study found no connections between the two, Unruh said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rfkjrsept222025-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

Women’s Leadership Conference: RISE brings record attendance, powerful stories, and a renewed call for intentional leadership.
WILMINGTON, Del. — The New Castle County Chamber of Commerce’s annual Women’s Leadership Conference: RISE drew hundreds of business leaders, students, entrepreneurs, and community advocates to a sold-out gathering that blended professional development with honest conversations, economic insight, and the celebration of Delaware’s rising and established female leaders.
The full-day event — built around the theme of rising together — offered attendees the chance to network, learn, and hear from some of the most influential women shaping Delaware’s economic and social landscape. With keynote speakers from health care, higher education, and national nonprofits, plus five leadership award presentations, the program highlighted both the challenges women continue to face and the progress they are steadily driving.
For many, the event’s energy and sense of community were just as impactful as the formal programming.
“I’ve been here many times before and every year it keeps getting better and better and bigger and bigger,” said attendee Eve Pappas, Vice President of Business Development at Hoffman’s Exterminating. “Women are very intuitive to employee and client concerns, and to have an event like this that lifts them up to become better leaders is tremendous.”
A Showcase of Leadership, Ambition, and Collective Progress
The morning program opened with a strong focus on empowerment and perspective, reinforced by rows of exhibitor tables featuring employers, universities, nonprofits, and companies committed to elevating women in the workplace.
Among them was Diamond State Financial Group, whose representatives said the environment creates a sense of alignment and momentum.
“I think the impact is huge,” said exhibitor Allison Oberembt, Financial Advisor. “Seeing a lot of women in different paths just gives you ideas. If you’re unsure of where you belong, you’ll fit in here. The speakers and workshops are just filled with inspiring stories.”
For companies like Fulton Bank, a long-time sponsor, the conference reflects a commitment to economic and community investment.
“This is my first year attending, so I’m excited to be in the room with these amazing women,” said Jvonne Oliver, Financial Center Manager. “Fulton Bank has been sponsoring the event for 15 years or more. It fits into what we’re about — changing lives for the better, one conversation at a time.”
The atmosphere resonated beyond exhibitors. Educators and community leaders also leaned into the networking and shared purpose.
“I love it. I love all the connections we’re making and the feelings of sisterhood and camaraderie,” said Dr. Aisha Monroe, Executive Director of Graduate Programming and Student Success at Delaware State University. “My advice to the attendees is to stay open, never leave the mindset of a student, and be available to the opportunities around you.”
Keynote Speakers Emphasize Intentional Leadership and Personal Well-Being
This year’s keynote speakers tackled the deeper realities of leadership: navigating stress, leading through change, showing up with purpose, and sometimes simply admitting that you can’t do it alone.
ChristianaCare President and CEO Dr. Janice Nevin delivered an honest reflection on the responsibility and weight leaders carry — particularly women, who often juggle multiple roles.
Dr. Janice Nevin: “Leadership Isn’t Accidental”
ChristianaCare President and CEO Dr. Janice Nevin delivered an honest reflection on the responsibility and weight leaders carry — particularly women, who often juggle multiple roles.
“I think this is really, really important to the leaders in this room,” Nevin said. “It’s not a sign of weakness to feel you can’t do it alone. You have to be willing to say, ‘Hey, I could use a little help right now,’ and that’s OK.”
Nevin emphasized that leadership requires self-awareness and intentionality.
“Leadership isn’t accidental. You have to know your values, your purpose. And when those hard times come, and they will, you have to be intentional about your leadership,” she said. “What is it the people, whom you care about deeply, who are doing the work, need from you in this moment? It may not feel comfortable, but it is your job, as a leader, to do that.”
Her remarks resonated strongly with attendees navigating their own leadership journeys in industries ranging from finance to education to public service.
Dr. Laura Carlson: “Show Up — and Notice the Joy”
Dr. Laura Carlson, Interim President of the University of Delaware, focused on showing up fully, even amid demanding schedules and competing pressures.
“You have to show up, right,” Carlson said. “There’s a certain expectation, and taking care of yourself is important so that you can show up. But I also think it’s important to pay attention to the little joys that happen every day.”
Carlson pointed to the conference itself as a source of energy and optimism.
“This event will carry me for the next few days,” she said. “The fact that all of us are assembling and the energy that is here — that is awesome.”
Her remarks tied directly into the conference’s broader message: rising is not a solo act. It takes community, collaboration, and acknowledging the daily moments that keep leaders grounded.
Rosie Allen-Herring: “Respond — Don’t React”
The final keynote came from Rosie Allen-Herring, President & CEO of the United Way of the National Capital Area, who delivered a powerful message about resilience amid constant change.
“It is about, at the end of the day, what does resiliency look like,” she said. “I had to come to a point where I said to my team, ‘respond, but don’t react.’ Responding simply says, I acknowledge what’s happening.”
Her remarks acknowledged the challenges facing communities and nonprofits — rising needs, limited resources, shifting priorities — but stressed the importance of perspective.
“These times are challenging, but they don’t have to last always,” she said. “And so, this is an opportunity for us to think about who we serve, to focus on the community we serve.”
Leadership Awards Honor Women Shaping Delaware’s Future
One of the most anticipated portions of the conference each year is the presentation of leadership awards — recognizing women whose work, impact, and leadership stand out across Delaware’s business, nonprofit, and civic landscape.
This year’s honorees represented students, entrepreneurs, attorneys, community advocates, and emerging professionals — demonstrating the vast range of leadership pathways available to women.
Student Leadership Award: Billi Roman
University of Delaware freshman and Ice Hockey Team member Billi Roman delivered a heartfelt perspective on what she’s learned about leadership at a young age.
“This journey is how I finally understood what leadership means to me,” Roman said. “Leaders speak up when something matters. They ask for what they need. They advocate for themselves, not because it’s easy, but because it’s necessary.”
She emphasized that leadership isn’t only about directing others.
“There’s another side to leadership, a willingness to help,” she said. “Helping others is leadership because it shows you care.”
Young Woman Professional Award: Jacqueline Flowers
Jacqueline Flowers, Project Estimator at EDiS Company, offered one of the most personal reflections of the day — crediting her mother for instilling the foundation of her leadership style.
“Standing here today, I feel grateful, humble, and honestly a bit in awe to be surrounded by so many remarkable women,” she said. “My mom… taught me countless things, but one lesson has become the heartbeat of my life: always look for inspiration in the women around you.”
Her remarks captured the spirit of the event — women learning from women, generation to generation.
State Service Award: Lisa A. Schmidt
Lisa A. Schmidt, Director and Immediate Past President of Richards, Layton & Finger, spoke about the importance of civic stewardship and legal leadership.
“Today’s recognition isn’t just one person’s work,” Schmidt said. “It’s all about Delaware’s shared commitment to stewardship. To protecting what works, improving what we can, and ensuring that future generations inherit a system as strong as the one we have.”
Her comments provided a reminder that leadership includes sustaining systems that work — and courageously addressing those that don’t.
Impact Award: Katie Kutler
Entrepreneur and café owner Katie Kutler, of kaffé KARMA & KARMA’s korner, delivered a message centered on integrity and action.
“Impact does mean so much to me, and thank you for recognizing me today,” Kutler said. “I just think that you have to do the right thing. Even when you’re not sure somebody is going to recognize you and support you for it.”
She also spoke about the misconception surrounding “manifesting” success.
“The universe doesn’t hand you things when you manifest,” she said. “Manifestation without action is just daydreaming.”
Her story, rooted in small business resilience, aligned with broader statewide conversations about entrepreneurship, local economies, and community support.
Female Leader of the Year: Yvette Santiago
The conference’s top honor went to Yvette Santiago, Regional Director of Community Engagement and Impact at Nemours Children’s Health.
Her speech was emotional, grounded in identity, family, and determination.
“For so many reasons, this award means a lot. One of the reasons that sticks out the most is defying the odds,” she said. “As women. As women of color. As Latinas, we have to defy the odds. And that’s what sticks out to me.”
Santiago credited her parents for shaping her discipline and character.
“Their sacrifice, love, and support enabled my success,” she said. “Success… requires discipline, sacrifice, patience, and consistently working hard to achieve your goals and dreams.”
Her remarks earned a standing ovation — a fitting finale to the award ceremony.
A Conference That Builds Momentum — and Community
By the afternoon, the conference had transformed into more than a networking event. It had become a shared experience — a blend of mentorship, professional development, and affirmation for women across Delaware and the region.
The exhibitors, speakers, and award winners offered a textured narrative of what leadership looks like today: intentional, values-driven, community-minded, and grounded in real lived experiences.
For many attendees, the power of the event wasn’t just in the formal sessions, but in the connections sparked between them.
As DSU’s Dr. Monroe put it: “Stay open. Never leave the mindset of a student.”
And that sentiment — curiosity, growth, and willingness to rise together — is exactly what the Women’s Leadership Conference continues to cultivate year after year.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-26-095830.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

And though there are strict eligibility requirements for private-school scholarships, eligibility isn’t checked after the initial scholarship is awarded or for siblings of students who received a scholarship.
The revelations about the inner workings of Missouri’s private school voucher program came to light over the course of a two-day trial in Cole County Circuit Court this week.
The focus of the arguments Monday and Tuesday were over whether the state can use general revenue for private school tuition, with the attorney general’s office defending state funds as transformative for the program and Missouri’s largest teacher’s union saying the funding is unlawful.
But witness testimony pulled back the curtain on certain details about the MOScholars program that have stayed largely out of the public consciousness.
MOScholars, which is in its fourth year of operation, awards scholarships to K-12 students who meet certain criteria.
When state lawmakers created the program in a 2021 bill, they set it up to run on donations that are eligible for a 100% tax credit up to half of a donor’s tax liability. In the first three years of the program, donations totaled $33.8 million.
Gov. Mike Kehoe announced in January that he intended to bring a major infusion of funding to the program through a $50 million appropriation of general revenue. This windfall for MOScholars has allowed the state to nearly triple the amount of scholarships awarded this fall.
“If not for general revenue, would many of (the new) scholars be able to receive a scholarship?” Assistant Attorney General Peter Donahue asked the treasurer’s director of programs, Trent Blair.
“No,” Blair answered.
Loretta Haggard, an attorney representing the Missouri National Education Association, questions the State Treasurer’s director of programs in a trial challenging the constitutionality of Missouri’s funding of school vouchers Tuesday morning in the Cole County Courthouse (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Of 6,418 scholarships awarded this school year, only 111 are funded through tax credits. That includes the 2,405 students who were in the program last year. So if MOScholars did not receive the state appropriation, the funding would cover less than 5% of the renewal students going into the school year.
The State Treasurer’s Office, which oversees MOScholars, has previously admitted to problems with the timing of funding. The bulk of donations hit the accounts of educational assistance organizations — intermediary nonprofits that connect students with the funding — in December.
With tuition due in August, MOScholars had to either with eight months to award the funds or put stress on the system. Blair testified that the educational assistance organizations largely chose the latter and that the organizations themselves choose when to use donated funds. 
In 2023, two of the six educational assistance organizations acknowledged they used their private funds to pay tuition in the fall and paid themselves back once they received donations. In October, two organizations told The Independent that they were able to fund scholarships for all their renewal students and clear their waitlists with the new state funds.
The state money “stabilizes the program,” Blair testified Tuesday.
Representing the Missouri National Education Association, attorney Loretta Haggard unearthed issues with the administration of the program as she cross-examined Blair.
She honed in on MOScholars’ eligibility requirements. State law limits the program to students with an individualized education plan or those whose family makes at or below 300% of the income standard used to qualify for free and reduced price lunches.
The treasurer’s office uses an education management system called FACTS to review applications and determine eligibility. Haggard asked if the software checks if renewal students still meet eligibility requirements. 
It doesn’t, Blair said.
“So a student can receive a scholarship even though they don’t meet the IEP or income requirements?” Haggard then asked.
“Yes,” Blair said.
When a student is eligible one year, the system presumes that they retain eligibility. The siblings of renewal students are also deemed eligible.
The treasurer’s office has faced criticism before over how it has administered MOScholars, including complaints from Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck that the office wasn’t transparent about program data. And in July, a report from the State Auditor found the treasurer’s office didn’t conduct annual audits of the MOScholars program required by state law.
But Tuesday’s testimony was the first time the state has admitted to not rechecking eligibility, something that is routine for other state-funded programs like food assistance or Medicaid. 
Bryan Cleveland, an attorney with Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice, spoke on behalf of families who say they benefit from increased MOScholars (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Any questions about the administration of the program don’t impact the legality of the appropriation, said Bryan Cleveland, an attorney with Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice, who intervened in the case on behalf of three parents whose children have received assistance through MOScholars.
“The case does not depend on whether any one treasurer is doing a good job but rather on interpretation of statutory provisions,” he told the judge. “The rest of the discussion of what the treasurer or the educational assistance organizations do after (the appropriation) is not relevant.”
Blair, stepping off the witness stand Tuesday, sighed, head tucked as he walked back to his seat. The trial marked one of the few occasions the treasurer’s office has answered questions publicly, apart from occasional statements to the media.
When Cole County Judge Brian Stumpe denied a request for a temporary restraining order, which would have blocked the spending of the general revenue during the trial, the treasurer’s office held a joint press conference with the Missouri Attorney General’s Office but did not take any questions.
On Monday, attorneys argued over whether the Missouri NEA or its individual members had standing to challenge the state appropriation to MOScholars. 
A decision on the case is not expected until after Dec. 8, when attorneys’ post-trial filings are due.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112425_blair1-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Photo by Karsan Turner for Iowa Capital Dispatch) The cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner set for 10 people, at $55.18, is 5% less than the cost in 2024, annual data from the American Farm Bureau Federation shows.
While key meal items like turkey and dinner rolls decreased in price this year, fresh vegetables and Thanksgiving dairy products are substantially more expensive. 
Overall, the report found the cost of the meal is still higher than it was in 2020, when the meal cost $46.90.
Farm Bureau said the table items with price increases reflect some of the hardships that farmers faced this year. 
Christopher Pudenz, Iowa Farm Bureau’s research and economics manager, said declining prices for some Thanksgiving staples is good for consumers, but profitability “continues to be a challenge” for farmers in 2025. 
“Iowa farmers face historically low crop prices, high input costs and tight margins, yet they remain resilient and committed to doing what they do best—caring for their land, practicing good stewardship and raising healthy animals to provide abundant, affordable food for families here at home and across the country,” Pudenz said in a statement.

Turkey
While turkey is typically the star of the show – and the top billed item on the table – turkey represented just 39% of the cost of the Thanksgiving meal this year, which Farm Bureau said is the lowest share of the meal cost since 2000. On average, the bureau said the bird accounts for 43% of the total receipt.
This year the average 16-pound turkey cost $21.50, or $1.34 per pound, which is more than 16% less than the average turkey cost last year. 
While the price has declined, popularity has not. A consumer survey from the National Turkey Federation found that 87% of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving plan to serve turkey. The majority, 74%, serve the whole bird at the holiday and 65% choose to roast their turkey in the oven. 
The overall size of the turkey flock, according to USDA data, has declined. Farm Bureau said these flock sizes reflect the impact the highly pathogenic avian influenza has had on the industry. Since 2022, according to Farm Bureau, close to 19 million turkeys have been impacted by the bird flu. 
Iowa has only had one reported outbreak of the flu this fall – at a turkey farm in Calhoun County. 
And the fixins
Sweet potatoes, vegetable trays with carrots and celery, frozen peas, milk and whipping cream all increased in price this year. 
Cranberries, stuffing and rolls, however, decreased slightly in price for the 2025 meal. 
A 3-pound bag of sweet potatoes averaged $4, a 37% increase from the year prior, according to the report. 
Farm Bureau said natural disasters, like hurricanes in North Carolina — the nation’s largest producer of sweet potatoes —  partially contributed to the increase in cost. 
Produce costs have also increased in the country due to labor shortages, increased labor costs and supply chain or transportation setbacks, according to Farm Bureau. 
Group blames tariffs
The campaign Tariffs Cost US blamed tariffs for the increase in cost, citing farmer statements that have said increasing input costs have lead them to hike local produce costs. 
The organization also launched an ad campaign, ahead of Black Friday and holiday shopping, pinning tariffs for higher price tags. According to the group, local businesses are especially feeling the added costs and hoping the busy shopping season will keep them in the black. 
Rachel Lutz, owner of the Peacock Room in Detroit, said a $700 shipment of jewelry recently came with the added cost of $100 tariff. She worries the added fees will force more small businesses to close. 
“That adds up fast and is unsustainable in the long run,” Lutz said in a news release with Tariffs Cost US. “It has been heartbreaking to wake up so many mornings and see yet another family-owned business closing in our community because they cannot absorb these costs.”
Local business owners in Iowa have also expressed concerns about the impact tariffs will have on holiday shopping and their overall margins.
At the farmers’ table 
While consumer prices fluctuate from year to year, farmers continue to earn just a small percentage. USDA data shows farmers receive less than 16 cents for every dollar spent on food in the U.S.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, in a news release Monday, reminded Iowans of the role farmers play in the Thanksgiving meal. 
“As we gather this week with our family and friends, I invite everyone to pause for a moment and give thanks for Iowa’s hardworking farm families who produce the delicious Thanksgiving meals on our tables,” Naig said. 
National Farmers Union’s annual “Farmer’s Share of the Food Dollar” report shows farmers receive “only pennies on the dollar” for the typical Thanksgiving fare. 
The report shows farmers earn the least amount, 6 cents or 1.3% of the price, on a 12-ounce box of stuffing. Producers also score just 6 cents per pound, or 2.4% of the sale price of turkey. 
Farmers who sell turkeys direct to consumers and with free-range or organic traits earn more per dollar, but also charge more, between $5 and $7 per pound. 
Cranberry and green producers receive the highest percentage of the Thanksgiving food dollar for their commodities at nearly 32% and nearly 25% respectively. 
Farmers Union President Rob Larew, in a news release, said there is “continuous inequality” in the food system. 
“Every Thanksgiving, the numbers tell the same story: farmers aren’t asking for a bigger slice of pie, just a fair one,” Larew said. “It’s long past time to fix a food system that works for corporations but not for the families who grow and consume our food.”

The allegations are nothing new. Mississippi has cycled through five private prison health vendors over the past three decades amid recurring concerns about staffing shortages, weak oversight, unpaid bills to hospitals and inadequate care provided to patients. One report published nearly two decades ago by the Legislature’s watchdog committee echoes many of the questions raised by state lawmakers this year. 
Meanwhile, Mississippi Today’s Beyond Bars, Beyond Care series has documented alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons: potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons. 
The Legislature appropriated $690,000 this year for monitoring and review of its current prison health contract, held by Kansas-based VitalCore Health Strategies, Inc. A report is due to legislators by Dec. 15. 
Mississippi Today took a closer look at Mississippi’s contracts for medical services and asked experts what changes can be made to strengthen them. 
How long has Mississippi relied on private medical contractors?
Incarcerated people are one of the few groups in the United States with a constitutional right to health care. In the 1990s, faced with frequent lawsuits filed by incarcerated people, consent decrees and ballooning prison populations, an industry of private companies sprung up to shoulder the state’s responsibility of providing health care to people in prison. 
The Mississippi Department of Corrections began contracting out its medical services in 1998 after years of providing health care itself. The University of Mississippi Medical Center was the first entity chosen to provide the services, and since then, the department has held contracts with four other companies. 
Mississippi selected VitalCore for a three-year contract worth over $357 million in 2024. The company won out over Wexford Health Sources and Centurion of Mississippi, both companies that have held the contract for prison medical services in the past, in a competitive bidding process. VitalCore was awarded over $315 million in emergency, no-bid state contracts from 2020 to 2024.
VitalCore holds correctional health contracts in several other states, including Massachusetts, Michigan and Delaware, and it has faced legal battles and scrutiny in other jurisdictions. 
VitalCore was sued last year by its former chief officer medical of operations in Vermont, who alleged the company forged his signature on policy documents and fired him after he raised alarm bells about conditions in the state’s prisons. A 2019 lawsuit alleges that a 48-year-old with documented heart problems collapsed and died in a New Mexico county jail after VitalCore staff failed to properly monitor his condition. And significant understaffing of medical positions in Massachusetts prisons led VitalCore to pay back $1.4 to $1.7 million a month to the state, according to reporting by the Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism.
Dan Mistak, the director of health care initiatives for justice-involved populations at Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, described the process of states contracting corrections medical companies as a “revolving door.” 
When a new company is awarded the contract, it often rehires many of the same staff members. If controversy arises over the quality of care or another issue, the company carries the blame and either receives more money from the state to fulfill its obligations or leaves. A new company then rotates in. 
“Rinse, cycle, repeat, over and over again,” Mistak said. 
Centurion, a company previously tasked with providing health care to Mississippi’s prisoners, terminated its contract with the corrections department in 2020 amid an ongoing legal battle with prisoners, arguing that the state’s failure to invest in infrastructure and correctional staffing prevented the company from performing its duties. Centurion was brought in under an emergency contract, like VitalCore, in 2015.
The prior contractor, Wexford, was accused of funneling consulting fees to a former Mississippi state legislator, Cecil McCrory, who pleaded guilty to bribing a Mississippi corrections commissioner, Chris Epps, in exchange for Epps’ efforts to steer state prison contracts. The state collected $4 million from the company in a lawsuit. 
How have prison health care costs changed under the new contract? 
Mississippi’s per capita spending on prison health care has risen steadily over the last 25 years, according to reports by the Legislature’s watchdog branch, the Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee. 
In 2000, the state spent $5.07 per day on health care for people in its custody. In 2024, the cost was three times as high – $16.03 per day. In recent years, spending on basic medical care has risen starkly while the costs of specialty care have grown more slowly or dropped. 
Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain attributed the rise in costs to inmates overusing medical services. Speaking at a legislative budget hearing Sept. 24, he likened the business of providing medical services to people in Mississippi’s prisons to caring for animals.

“It just goes up, and these inmates go to the doctor for everything,” he said. “And the problem is, it’s like being, I hate to say it, sometimes it’s like being a veterinarian to say what really, what’s wrong with you.”
The Department of Corrections did not respond to questions about why costs are rising or what Cain meant. 
Marc Stern, a faculty member at the University of Washington and former assistant secretary for health care at the Washington Department of Corrections who serves as a medical adviser for the National Sheriffs’ Association and American Jail Association, said the rise in basic care costs may be the result of rising costs for salaries and medications. 
He said health care in jails and prisons in the U.S. is often not funded as well as it needs to be to ensure that people receive quality care.
“As a result, you get what you pay for,” Stern said. “… Is it the fault of the company or is it the fault of the legislature? I guess that’s a philosophical question.” 
Mississippi’s prison population is growing older, which can result in more costly care. The portion of prisoners aged 55 or older has grown by about 10% in the past 20 years, accounting for 12% of the population in 2019. 
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates per capita in the world — 661 people per 100,000. About 19,500 people are currently incarcerated in state prisons. 
How does a fixed-rate model of health spending shape the care prisoners receive? 
VitalCore is paid a flat rate adjusted to reflect the number of people in custody, regardless of their medical needs. It is required to provide onsite care, including mental health, dental, dialysis, laboratory and optometry care, and cover the costs of offsite care at hospitals or for specialty care. In the first year of the contract, VitalCore is paid about $115 million, with adjustments of $53.54 for each inmate below 19,000 or above 19,600. The payment rates grow each year. 
This means that if a contractor spends less to provide health care to people in state custody, it reaps a larger profit. But, it loses money if it exceeds cost projections.
The fixed-rate model is more predictable for the state than other models, like reimbursing a contractor for the care they provide. While the state won’t see the savings if less is spent on medical services, it also won’t be required to pay extra if more is spent. It is the most common way to structure prison health contracts among all states, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trust published in 2015. 
This model can, in theory, reward preventive care measures that keep people healthy and reduce expensive interventions. But it can also encourage delayed or inadequate care, since contractors can save money by limiting the care they provide. Strong monitoring is the key to curbing these risks, experts said. 
Because about 95% of people will be released from prison at some point, communities absorb the consequences of delayed or inadequate care in the long term through higher emergency room use, worsening population health or infectious disease spread, Mistak said. 
This can burden hospitals and state safety-net programs, like Medicaid and Medicare, down the road. 
“Those costs are going to be borne by the state and the community,” he said.  
What if a company’s bid isn’t enough? 
In a competitive process for prison health care vendors, the company with the lowest bid usually wins the contract. But when correctional care providers propose a low budget to stand out during the procurement process, they sometimes can not afford the costs of care they proposed and still turn a profit, Mistak said. 
In some cases, contractors will return to government entities that contracted them to ask for more money. This has played out in Missouri and a county jail in Wisconsin in recent years. 
“You end up paying more anyway for a lot of these contracts,” Mistak said. 
That’s what happened in Mississippi. In May, MDOC requested $4 million for a “deficit appropriation” – money to cover a shortfall – for VitalCore, according to House Corrections Committee Chairwoman Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven.
How do staffing clawbacks work?
If VitalCore does not meet staffing requirements outlined in the contract, the company must pay the corrections department back the average hourly wage for each unfilled hour of work, plus a 20% fee for employee benefits, according to the contract. 
“We’re really good at that,” Cain said Sept. 24. “We take back from the money that they didn’t spend on hiring people. They don’t get to keep it.” 
He said the department has used funds recouped from VitalCore for unmet staffing requirements to pay for improvements to buildings and infrastructure. 
But returning the salaries of unfilled positions isn’t enough, Stern said. To truly motivate companies to fill the position, they must face a financial consequence beyond the value of the vacant position. 
“Those penalties have to be stiff enough to be more than what the vendor saves from not filling the position,” he said. 
Why have legislators said VitalCore is ‘slow paying’ its bills to vendors? 
At the Sept. 24 budget hearing, Sen. Daniel Sparks, a Republican from Belmont, said that VitalCore delaying payments to vendors, including the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has been a “continual issue.” 
Currie told Mississippi Today that Bolivar Medical Center in Cleveland, about 25 miles from the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, has faced similar challenges. 
Neither hospital, the Department of Corrections or VitalCore responded to a request for comment. 
Cain said Sept. 24 the issue was due in part to hospitals billing VitalCore at rates higher than the agreed-upon costs for prison medical services. Deputy Commissioner of Administration and Finance Derrick Garner said the agency is monitoring the issue and aims to increase oversight of the payments.
Sparks said that VitalCore could pay the agreed-upon rate rather than waiting to negotiate rates. 
“But to not pay the bill at all, and let the bill get into the millions of dollars when that’s a state entity that’s supposed to be paid by a state entity and the intermediary is holding up the payment, it doesn’t settle well,” Sparks said. 
What kind of oversight does Mississippi use to monitor the contract? 
The Department of Corrections performs oversight of its contract with VitalCore. Monitoring tasks include reviewing service levels, quality of care and administrative practices, meeting with VitalCore to address issues, conducting site visits and inspections and reviewing third-party reimbursements, according to the contract. 
The state examining its own contract reduces the costs of bringing in an outside monitor and allows the state more control over what it tracks, said Stern. 
But the quality of monitoring depends on how willing the state is to hold a contractor accountable, and states may be less stringent out of fear that a contractor will bail. 
“The threats of leaving can really make a state gulp,” Mistak said. “…And so sometimes they lay off the gas when it comes to enforcing their own contract.”
The Mississippi Legislature has made several efforts of its own to scrutinize the medical care provided in state prisons. 
The Legislature tasked the health department with studying the challenges of providing health care to people who are incarcerated in 2024, and State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney presented initial findings at the Capitol in January. The health department will produce a report roughly a year from now, including recommendations to MDOC, said spokesperson Greg Flynn. 
This year, the Legislature appropriated funding for the Department of Corrections to monitor and review the medical services contract, with a report due to legislators by Dec. 15. Cain said Sept. 24 that the contract for the report has been finalized. 
Rep. Becky Currie speaks during a hearing  Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2020, at the State Capitol in Jackson, Miss. Credit: Eric J. Shelton/Mississippi Today, Report For America
MDOC did not respond to questions about who was awarded the contract.
Currie, who has spent the last year probing for answers as to why inmates are getting sicker as the state increases its spending on medical care, said she is curious to see the report’s finding. She authored a failed bill this year that would have tasked the health department with conducting a sweeping review of medical care for people incarcerated in Mississippi at no cost. 
“Yet, we spend $700,000 on a report,” she said to Mississippi Today. 
Does privatizing prison health care make the system better?
Most states contract all or part of their prison health services with private companies. Several states provide their own prison health services through government agencies, like Louisiana.
If a state develops a strong oversight system, they can gain the expertise to manage the contract themselves, said Stern. Providing health care in-house can reduce costs for states, he said, because contractors must make a profit margin and less duplication of services exists between the state and the contractors. 
It also creates more opportunities for continuity between prison health care and community health care, which would make it easier for health providers to care for people when they are released, experts said. 
Some evidence shows that medical services run by government agencies may lead to lower death rates. A 2020 Reuters investigation of more than 500 jails in the U.S. showed that facilities with private healthcare contractors had higher death rates than those run by government agencies. 
Currie said she would like to see prison health care run by the state or a local hospital system, which she said would ensure stronger accountability and quality care. 
“I’m just not able to sit back and watch people die and be treated badly, no matter who they are,” Currie said. 
“…Most of these people are coming out. And the new law is that most of them will come out. And you know, we need them to be healthy and ready to go to work and lower our recidivism rate.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06114603/37b90-prisonercopy.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Getty Images)America’s farthest-west town, Adak, is being sued by a former employee who alleges he was denied overtime pay and pressured into resigning because of racism by city officials.
A city council member named in the lawsuit, Christian Tolliver, declined extensive comment but said the allegation is untrue. A second person named as a defendant, former city council member Elaine Smiloff, could not be reached for comment.
The lawsuit, from Xavier Charles, was filed Nov. 12 in state Superior Court at Unalaska. It names the 67-person town of Adak and two city council members as defendants. Charles is seeking an unspecified financial award, including back pay, front pay, and “compensatory damages.”
Charles, who is Black, was a public works laborer from March 2023 to April 2024, and delivered mail, did maintenance and a variety of jobs throughout the town.
The complaint alleges that a federal contractor who invited Charles to dinner at the Adak Lodge — owned by Tolliver — was told by Tolliver “that Plaintiff’s ‘kind were not allowed at his house.’”
The complaint says Tolliver repeatedly questioned Charles’ conduct and states that Tolliver told one of Charles’ coworkers that Charles “rides around the neighborhood stealing and joy riding” and said “he’s black so he must be stealing.”
The complaint alleges that Tolliver’s wife tracked Charles while he did his work, and that Charles’s supervisor called Tolliver racist.
Charles filed a formal complaint with a third-party firm used by the city of Adak. The resulting investigation “concluded with a finding that the allegations were substantiated,” the complaint states, but adds that “the city of Adak took no meaningful disciplinary action.”
In April 2024, another city council member told Charles, “if I didn’t resign they were going to figure out a way to fire me anyways,” the complaint states.
Charles filed a complaint with the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission and a charge with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the EEOC issued a “notice of right to sue.”
Charles is being represented by Anchorage attorney Isaac Zorea.
“It’s unfortunate,” Zorea said by phone. “Charles came from the Lower 48 up to Adak; you’re moving quite a distance from the South, you would think that you’d have a better reception.”
He noted that Tolliver has a Confederate flag on his truck, something mentioned in the complaint.
“I think it’s just sad, you know. It doesn’t look good for our state,” Zorea said.
Former Adak city manager Layton Lockett, who ran the city during Charles’ time, did not return two phone calls seeking comment. Adak’s current acting manager declined to comment, saying she had not seen the lawsuit.
Tolliver, reached by phone, declined extensive comment, saying that if he is formally served with the lawsuit, he will have a lawyer respond. 
“I don’t know where or who he’s trying to extort money from, but he had just gotten out of prison when he got here, and his uncle was trying to give him a new start, and it didn’t really work out,” Tolliver said. “His behavior wasn’t what many people on the island would have wished it had been, so that was more of a problem with most people that I know than his skin color, and maybe he confused the two.”
Tolliver said he is a retired Army officer and has worked with racially different people before.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Collin Tuthill, president of one of the country’s largest canned and frozen food importers and distributors, said the current state of the U.S. food industry is “like we live in some kind of alternate universe.”
The most efficient industry is being hit the hardest by tariff policies and rising costs, he said Tuesday during a video call with reporters.
“The folks that are taking the punches are the ones that can’t really afford to take the punches,” said Tuthill, president of Royal Food Import, a North Carolina-based company that distributes food to hospitals, food banks, schools and prisons.
Tuthill was part of a group brought together by Tariffs Cost US, a campaign highlighting the detrimental effects of Trump administration tariff policies.
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, said costs were already rising — for consumers and farmers — before President Donald Trump implemented tariffs.
“With tariffs, they are going up more,” he said.
Families see the effects in the cost of their Thanksgiving meals, he said.
Tariffs on imported steel have increased the overall cost of canned goods. Cheeses, spices and chocolates also have become more expensive. The tariffs, which have reached the highest average rate since 1935, stack on top of higher fuel, seed, fertilizer, equipment and transportation costs, Levendofsky said. 
Then farmers see an even smaller share of profits.
For a turkey that costs $2.40 per pound, a farmer receives 6 cents, Levendofsky said. For a $6.99, 8-pound bag of potatoes, farmers receive 94 cents. A $4.49, 18-ounce package of dinner rolls gets a farmer 9 cents. A 12-ounce bag of green beans sold for $2.49 earns a farmer 62 cents.
“So when we talk about tariffs, we’re not talking about an abstract policy. We’re talking about real price increases on the foods that make up a traditional Thanksgiving dinner,” Levendofsky said. “Every added cost in the supply chain eventually shows up at the checkout line.”
The bottom line, he said, is tariffs don’t protect families or farmers.
Mary Carroll Dodd, owner of Red Scout Farm in western North Carolina, grows crops to sell through community-supported agriculture, at farmers’ markets and to local restaurants. Many of the supplies she depends upon — greenhouse materials, potting soil, tools, insect netting and produce bags — come from Canada, Mexico and China.
Costs add up quickly and profit margins are thin, she said.
“Every increase means tough choices,” Dodd said.
That can include price hikes for customers or other cost-cutting measures, which often come at the expense of fair worker pay, she said.
Because of the increase in her farm’s costs, she has raised the price of collard greens, kale and lettuce mix bags.
“We should be making it easier for family farms to survive,” Dodd said, “not harder.”
The Trump administration has touted trade deals and proposed bailout payments to mitigate low crop prices and high production costs. The administration also has claimed Thanksgiving food prices are lower this year than in past years, which the panelists said was misleading and inaccurate.
“A bailout is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” Levendofsky said.
Policy shifts throughout the agriculture industry are needed, he said. Kansas has piles of sorghum that are growing by the minute, but there’s no market for the farmers that grow it, he said. Farmers also need antitrust law enforcement that targets massive companies that have outsized control of markets, particularly meatpackers, Levendofsky said.
“I can honestly say farmers don’t want a bailout,” he said. “They want trade, not aid.”
Dodd said farms need long-term, sustainable solutions that are not one-size-fits-all. Existing programs within the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, such as its conservation stewardship program and cropshare programs, can provide farmers with sustainability.
Tuthill said a bailout is not going to solve farmers’ issues. The food industry needs customers outside of the country to draw dollars back into the country, he said.
For his company, tariffs and rising costs have meant fewer items going to food banks, smaller portions in school cafeterias and lower quality products in hospitals and prisons. Tariffs or taxes on food make no sense, he said.
“We’re at a pretty sad state of affairs to see that we’re raising the price of food for the most in need,” Tuthill said. “We see it every day.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Glickman-levendofsky-20250827_131619-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 09:57:03.026470

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is giving thanks for our readers and other blessings, and will return to your inboxes on Monday, Dec. 1.
Will a cap on student loans discourage Californians from becoming nurses? We may find out.
The Trump administration is proposing to restrict the amount of money nursing students can borrow to advance their education, raising worries that the change could potentially worsen California’s nursing shortage.
The U.S. Department of Education earlier this month wrapped up a rulemaking session ironing out details about new federal student loan rules from President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget bill that passed in July.
The bill eliminates two loan programs — one of which is Grad PLUS loans, a type of federal student aid for graduate students — while also creating what the department describes as the “new and simplified” Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP.
Under RAP, which will be available in July, the total federal debt cap for students in professional programs is $200,000 and $100,000 for other graduate students. The education department is proposing to define professional degrees as degrees in medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, law, clinical psychology and other fields.
Nursing wouldn’t make the cut for the higher loan cap.
California faces a shortage of about 36,000 licensed nurses. The number of students opting to attend private, more expensive nursing programs in California is also rising. In a statement to CalMatters, the University of California, which has four nursing schools, said “limiting access to student loans … for aspiring nurses will only worsen this (shortage) crisis by undermining efforts to grow the workforce.”
The lowered borrowing cap would also make it harder for nursing students to become nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists or other positions that require advanced degrees, nursing organizations argue.

Sandy Reding, president of the California Nurses Association union: “Nurse practitioners currently provide much-needed primary care, particularly in rural and underserved areas. If this rule went into effect, it could have a major impact on nurses’ access to graduate nursing programs. In addition, it will make it more difficult to find nursing faculty with advanced degrees to teach in nursing programs. We want to be clear that this is an attack on the nursing profession.”

The effect of the proposed loan cap for nurses could be similar to what experts anticipate about Trump’s new student loan caps for medical students: That higher financial barriers for students to pursue certain degrees would make the pool of prospective health care workers both shrink and become less diverse.
The education department released a statement Monday arguing that 95% of nursing students already borrow below the loan limit and won’t be affected by the rule change. Ellen Keast, the department’s press secretary for higher education, also told Newsweek that the plan’s definition of professional degrees aligns with “historical precedent.”

Keast: “We’re not surprised that some institutions are crying wolf over regulations that never existed because their unlimited tuition ride on the taxpayer dime is over.”

The department said it plans to finalize the student loan rules by early next year.

A setback for The Wonderful Company

From CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang:
California ag giant The Wonderful Company suffered a setback in its bid to overturn a new law that some of its workers had used to unionize when an appeal court tossed its lawsuit against state labor regulators. 
The Tuesday decision by a three-judge panel of the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno leaves in place a new law backed by the United Farm Workers that was meant to help it gain members. The law allows farmworkers to signal their support for union representation using a signed card, bypassing the traditional in-person, secret-ballot election usually held on the employer’s property. 
The Wonderful Company filed suit against the state’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board last year trying to overturn the law. The suit, alleging the law is unconstitutional, came after the United Farm Workers filed a petition with enough signatures to represent 600-odd workers at the company’s grape nursery in Wasco. 
Elizabeth Strater, United Farm Workers’ vice president, said the decision affirms that “every farm worker in California has rights under the law, and those rights need to be protected.” But the company’s general counsel Craig Cooper dismissed the ruling as only a matter of timing: “The decision explicitly does not address the merits of Wonderful Nurseries’ constitutional challenge.”



The latest on Trump’s immigration crackdown

Let’s get into some immigration news:

Student financial aid: The Trump administration is suing California to block its policy of offering in-state tuition, scholarships and loans to immigrant students who do not have legal status. Federal lawyers argue that California’s policy is unconstitutional, and violates a federal law that bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. An estimated 100,000 college students lack legal status in the state. California is the sixth state Trump is targeting of the more than 20 states that have some in-state tuition policy that benefits residents without legal status. The California Department of Justice said it is prepared to fight the lawsuit. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman and Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Arrests at ICE check-ins: A routine check-in with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement landed a San Diego pedicab driver in detainment — a situation that advocates say more immigrants are experiencing under Trump’s immigration crackdown. In 2022 Idris Demirtas sought asylum in the U.S. after fleeing Turkey to escape religious persecution. He received a five-year work permit and has no criminal history, according to his wife and attorneys. Last week federal immigration agents arrested Demirtas at a San Diego federal courthouse where he was ordered to appear for a check-in. He’s now being held at a detention center, and ICE did not respond to a request for comment about why Dimitras was arrested or why he’s still detained. Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.

One witness after another faced the House Oversight and Reform Committee and described their experience at the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which descended on Los Angeles in June, stirring discontent with a theatrical assault on the city’s immigrant communities. 
One man who has lived in Los Angeles for 23 years and is married with four children, dropped his younger kids at school on June 6 and headed to work, where ICE agents detained him. He ended up at an ICE facility in Adelanto, struggling with his health, waiting for days to see a nurse or doctor. Eventually he was released and is home in Los Angeles. 
A young woman, not present for the hearing but represented by a friend, was up early one morning to sell tamales outside a local school. ICE agents tossed her to the ground, injuring her so seriously she had to be hospitalized. She’s an American citizen and was released but now is so scared of ICE, she refuses to leave her house. She has been inside for 158 days.
Yet another man, detained on June 10 by masked men who had no identification or warrant for his arrest, remained locked up by ICE until Sept. 16, when he was released on bail. He described his 98 days of detention: rotten food, orders to stay silent when officials visited, an atmosphere of danger. 
His voice broke as he acknowledged he had been raped. The experience, he said, “reminded me of the violence that I lived through in my country, Honduras.”
Their stories were piercing, puncturing any glib stereotypes about immigrants, documented or undocumented. These were not dangerous criminals who need to be removed to protect this country. They are working men and women, laboring to support their families and loved ones. 
President Donald Trump promised to go after the “worst of the worst,” but his agents ended up harassing and devastating these decent people. And their detentions benefited no one.
Moreover, there are costs to others around them. Witnesses from local organizations made clear in their testimony that school attendance is down, church pews are half-empty, summer youth programs struggled to stay afloat and businesses are suffering for want of employees and customers.

Some people are afraid to venture out because they lack proper documentation. Others are afraid because they simply “look illegal.”
That apparently was the case for Andrea Velez. The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Velez was born in the United States and is, therefore, an American citizen. 
On June 2, her mom dropped her off at work in the fashion district. But before Velez could get inside, she was rushed by ICE officers, who took her into custody. She was not carrying any proof of American citizenship — few people do — and ICE was not interested in her driver’s license. She was handcuffed and detained.
Denied food, she was told she could only have water if she purchased a cup. She was rebuffed in her requests to contact family or a lawyer. Velez was held two days, until June 4.
To be clear, Velez had committed no crime and is a native-born American citizen. Her only offenses were to come to work and to be Latino. 
She asked the officers who arrested her for their names but was denied that, too. “They told me I didn’t need to know their names,” she said in response to questioning by Congress members who participated in the hearing.
One member questioned her more deeply, wondering if she had done anything to warrant such treatment. Velez said she had not been carrying any weapons and had neither attacked nor threatened any officer. She is 4 feet, 11 inches tall.
The treatment described by witnesses at the hearing should shock the conscience, but some consciences appear too hardened to be moved. 
As Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, who presided over the session, noted, the cruelty of these policies is not a defect — it is the point.
“It was over the top from Day 1,” Bass told me after the hearing, “the way they dramatized it by pulling up on the street and jumping out with rifles at a woman selling fruit. There’s no way in the world you can tell me they thought she was a criminal … It was designed to terrorize. It was to go in and inflict maximum damage.”
These wanton attacks on the fabric of Los Angeles life have had at least one positive effect: In a city that has sometimes seen Black and brown residents turn against each other, this episode has been unifying, something many speakers remarked on, and that was reinforced by the proceeding itself: Garcia, a native of Peru and naturalized American citizen, sat next to Bass, the first Black woman to serve as Los Angeles’s mayor.
Support for immigrants came from a broad range of speakers: from Rep. Maxine Waters to immigrant groups, from union leadership to prominent Japanese-Americans. including some who drew parallels to the 1942 internments that were carried out under the same legal authority Trump is using now for his anti-immigrant actions.
Monday’s hearing was packed, and speakers were often interrupted by cheers and applause. As witnesses concluded their sometimes-harrowing stories, others stepped forward to hug and comfort them. A session called to collect evidence became an opportunity to demonstrate solidarity.
One of the day’s loudest expressions of support came for Waters, when she used her time to denounce Trump, whom she called a “low-down, no-good, filthy president.” The audience — white, Black, Asian, Latino, old and young — cheered loudly for that. Give him his due: Trump has brought Los Angeles together.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070725-MacArthur-Park-Feds-JW-CM-20.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The Trump administration is suing California, asking the state to end its policies allowing students without legal status to access in-state tuition and financial aid. But the administration’s legal argument is weak, according to top legal experts. 



Hours after the Trump administration sued California last week, threatening to end key benefits for students without legal status, Michelle was scrolling social media when she saw a video that made her panic. 
The Trump administration is challenging California’s policy of providing in-state tuition, scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants without legal status — including Michelle, an immigrant who is a community college student in San Mateo County. CalMatters has agreed to withhold her full name because she fears drawing attention to her legal status. 
On TikTok, rumors swirled. Michelle saw a video of a young man, around her age, asking if the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is gone. In reality, FAFSA is still around, and while the new lawsuit could affect some students’ financial aid, some top legal experts say the Trump administration is unlikely to win. Regardless, the court process may take weeks or much longer to resolve the government’s claims against California.
In the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that California’s policy of granting in-state tuition and financial aid for some students without legal status is unconstitutional. Federal lawyers also argue that California’s policies violate a 1996 federal law, which bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. The Justice Department is arguing that California either needs to drop the policy or let all U.S. citizens, including those who are out-of-state, pay the same rate.
In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants. Federal assistance, such as Pell grants and federal student loans, are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen or does not have permanent legal status. California has its own money for college financial aid, which it distributes according to state law. 
As long as individuals meet certain requirements, such as attending three years of high school in California, they’re eligible for in-state tuition, saving as much as $39,000 of dollars each year compared to their out-of-state peers. Once they meet those requirements, students without legal status can also qualify for the state’s cornerstone financial aid program, known as Cal Grant, though only a small fraction of these students actually apply for and receive it.   
To Kevin Johnson, a law professor at UC Davis, Trump’s actions may be more about political wins than legal ones. “The Trump administration is engaged in a full-court press on undocumented immigrants and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and California and Governor Newsom in particular,” Johnson said. That the U.S. Department of Justice named the suit “United States of America v. Newsom” is another indication that this is political, he added.
Others noted that states have already invested in students without legal status and denying them an affordable path toward a college education is a waste of resources. Economists have pointed out that immigrants without status also are integral to the U.S. workforce and aren’t easily replaceable. 
‘We didn’t expect them to go this low’
Even weak lawsuits or outright misinformation can make students nervous during November, when college and financial aid application season is in full swing.  
On TikTok, videos of students panicking about the financial aid system surfaced last winter, after the Biden administration delayed and botched the rollout of the new FAFSA. Among its many glitches, the new form prevented students whose parents lacked a Social Security number from submitting their information.
After Trump was elected last November, fears about the total demise of federal financial aid swirled again on TikTok. Over the course of this year, as his administration targets universities and continues to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, those fears have persisted. 
In California, Trump seeks to impose a $1 billion penalty on UCLA for alleged civil rights abuses, though a federal judge recently handed the White House a temporary loss on that front. His administration is also suing California colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism violations and has sought to freeze or curtail billions of dollars in federal research funding. 
Much of those freezes have been blocked or reversed by federal judges, but hundreds of millions of dollars still remain cut off to campuses. Much, if not all, of those friction points between California and Trump could be resolved through settlements and negotiations, which are political in nature, said UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura in an interview.
Before Trump was elected, state leaders, including Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, pushed for California to offer additional benefits to students without legal status, such as the opportunity to work campus jobs. 
Now, with access to financial aid programs at risk for these students, Alvarez said the focus is shifting. “We didn’t expect it would go this low as to go after students that the president had previously said should be welcomed here.” In 2024, Trump told a podcast host that students should “automatically” receive “a Green Card,” otherwise known as permanent residency, when they get their college diploma. 
Legal scholars doubt Trump’s lawsuit will win
The lawsuit against California is the Trump administration’s sixth against states with policies allowing in-state tuition for students without legal status. The White House went after Texas first, in June. Underscoring how much of a bipartisan issue in-state tuition is, Texan lawmakers were the first in the U.S. to enshrine the policy in 2001. In all, more than 20 states passed some in-state tuition policy benefiting some residents without legal status.Trump’s legal attacks on the policy this year prompted leaders in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas to side with the White House to terminate the benefit in those respective states. Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.Trump has also sued Minnesota and Illinois, states with Democrats as governors and attorneys general who are challenging Trump’s lawsuits.
The U.S. Department of Justice says that the federal law in question bars students without legal status from receiving in-state tuition and financial aid benefits based on their living in the state. This, the federal lawyers argue, violates federal law since public campuses in California require U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.  However, California’s law, Assembly Bill 540, doesn’t extend in-state tuition based on where students live, scholars and a previous court ruling say. Instead, students generally need to prove that they attended three years of high school or community college in California; they also need to earn in California a high school diploma or obtain enough community college credits to be eligible for transfer into a public university.The Department of Justice says those three-year high school or community college requirements are tantamount to an in-state residency criteria and therefore violate the 1996 federal law.But the California Supreme Court in 2010 already struck down that interpretation. The high court observed that some students living in areas bordering California are permitted to study at California high schools. High school students from out of state enrolled in private boarding schools also satisfy the requirement; they don’t count as residents of California either. And students who were residents of California during high school but moved to a different state could still enroll in California colleges or universities paying in-state tuition. 
All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status. The only difference is that students without status must also complete an affidavit that they’ll pursue legal residency as soon as they can. 
In fact, the University of California enrolled more students under AB 540 who were legal U.S. residents than those who weren’t, the state high court said then. 
“If Congress had intended to prohibit states entirely from making unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition, it could easily have done so,” the state Supreme Court wrote in 2010. But Congress didn’t do that, the court noted.Lawmakers in California who passed AB 540 in 2001 knew what the federal law restricted, said Motomura, and they crafted a state law that wouldn’t contravene what Congress intended. “It was drafted to avoid the residency test, and it was drafted to avoid the exclusion of U.S. citizens,” he said.
What’s likely next
California has already signaled that it will fight the lawsuit. “The Trump Administration has once again missed the mark with its latest attack on California, and we look forward to proving it in court,” wrote Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice. 
Both the UC and the community college system said their tuition and financial aid policies have always been legally compliant. The Cal State University system did not respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration may also seek a preliminary injunction to halt California’s in-state tuition law for nonresidents, which would again expose Californians to a seesaw of temporary court orders, sometimes contradictory in nature, while the full legal merits of the case play out slowly in court.Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, thinks the U.S. Supreme Court will likely side with California despite its conservative orientation if the case goes that far.A major legal question underscoring the case against California is when and how federal rules preempt or supersede state laws. The Trump White House is arguing California’s in-state policies are preempted by federal law. But the legal concept of preemption is a pillar in jurisprudence. Liberal and conservative interests benefit similarly from a consistent application of preemption as a legal concept, Saenz said. For example, businesses rely on preemption rules in situations where a state law is more progressive or consumer-friendly than a federal rule and want courts to defend them from following the more demanding state rules.The U.S. Supreme Court is “going to be very wary of making bad law in the realm of preemption, because it could then come back to bite the right wing in protecting businesses,” Saenz said. 
For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic. Financial aid is top of mind, said Michelle, but she doesn’t have time to track the legal back-and-forth of her eligibility. 
In addition to being a full-time student, Michelle works four days a week at a restaurant, saving up money not only to support herself but also her family. She’s the oldest of four kids and said she sends $500 to her parents each month.
College is “an opportunity for me to be someone in life, to make my parents proud,” she said. Asked about the lawsuit at the cafeteria of her college, Michelle made a choking gesture with her hand, as though the threat of losing financial aid next year could kill her. “Trump is taking that opportunity away because he doesn’t like immigrants.” 
The deadline to submit financial aid applications for community college is Sept. 2, but Michelle is already working on her application, just in case.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112823_DACA-Students_AE_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The U.S. deported just five immigrants from Turkey in the 2024 federal budget year. One Turkish immigrant now fears deportation after being summoned to a San Diego ICE office.


A San Diego pedicab driver who fled Turkey after being tortured because of his religious beliefs is the latest among hundreds of people who have been arrested across California at routine immigration check-ins, according to advocates, his attorneys, and his wife. 
Idris Demirtas, 25, sought asylum in El Paso in December 2022 and was legally paroled into the United States that same month. He was issued a five-year work permit. A biomed student in Turkey, Demirtas has no criminal history in his home country or the U.S., according to his wife and attorneys. 
“He is the sweetest, most loving, and kind person. Everyone who meets him loves him. He’s very family-oriented and a fair-minded person,” said his wife, Mae Bovenzi, who was born and raised in San Diego.
His attorneys and Bovenzi said Demirtas has scars on his body from physical violence he suffered in Turkey because he is not a member of the Muslim faith. 
“He’s never told me everything about what exactly happened, but he has scars all over his body,” said Bovenzi. 
In 2023, the U.S. Department of State issued a report finding in Turkey “significant human rights issues included credible reports of: enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government or on behalf of the government.”

The United States during the second Trump administration is deporting people to countries that were mostly off-limits in the past, such as Iran. In the past, authorities have been forced to either hold those immigrants indefinitely in detention or release them into the U.S. That means immigrant communities from countries that previously did not have to worry about being deported now have renewed cause for concern.  
A review of ICE Flight Monitor housed at the Human Rights First organization shows zero deportation flights to Turkey between January 2025 and October 2025. 
In April 2022, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency reported deporting a Turkish national who they said was suspected of providing support to terrorist organizations to Istanbul. The agency reported deporting five Turkish people in the 2024 federal budget year.
Arrests ramp up at immigration court
Federal immigration agents arrested Demirtas in San Diego last Thursday at the downtown federal Edward Schwartz courthouse, where he was responding to a call-in letter he received on Nov. 19 ordering him to appear for a check-in at 8 a.m. the next morning. With less than 16 hours’ notice, Demirtas and his wife decided he would go to the check-in because he was trying to comply with the law, his wife said. Bovenzi said she has barely been able to eat since the couple received the call-in notice. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment about why Dimitras was arrested or why he is still being detained. He is currently being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, operated by the for-profit prison company CoreCivic, according to a federal detainee locator database.
Apprehensions at ICE check-ins have ramped up across California since the beginning of October in cities such as San Diego, Fresno, and Stockton, according to news reports and advocacy groups. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in the first hours of his second term that lifted a previous Biden-era ban on arresting immigrants at sensitive places, including courthouses, schools, and churches. 
In October, activists with an organization called Detention Resistance documented more than 100 arrests at ICE check-in appointments on the second floor of the San Diego federal building. 
Some politicians, advocates, and lawyers argue that apprehensions at ICE check-ins violate people’s due process rights by creating a catch-22 for immigrants: If they go to their appointments, they may be detained for months and potentially deported. But if they don’t appear at a scheduled check-in or call-in, ICE can issue a formal deportation order against them, effectively guaranteeing their arrest and deportation. 
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla visited the San Diego immigration court in September and likened it to “a trap.”
“I think they’re accomplishing exactly what they want, which is basically forcing people into a really difficult decision,” said one of Demirtas’ attorneys, Tessa Cabrera. “You’re detaining someone, separating them from their family and their resources, their ability to make money and support their families … I think a lot of people are going to say, ‘I don’t want to deal with this,’ and just give up.” 
Detention conditions
Demirtas told his wife during a Sunday visitation at the Otay detention center that he was first held for 11 hours in the crowded basement of the downtown federal courthouse without access to food or water. He could hear babies crying throughout the night, according to his wife, Bovenzi. ICE did not respond to a question about whether or not infants are being held in the basement of the federal building. 
After being transferred to Otay, Demirtas told his wife he has been sleeping on the floor because of overcrowding. 
“He has now been provided with food, but none of it has been a complete nutritious meal,
the water is foul, and he has no bed, just a mat on the floor,” according to a draft court document one of his attorneys wrote on his behalf. 
 Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said everyone at the facility has a bed. 
“Any claim of water quality issues is patently false,” he said. Otay Mesa Detention Center “gets the same clean drinking water the local utility supplies to the surrounding community. Staff at our facility drink the same water as those in our care.” 
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Demirtas’ case. 
In late July, KPBS reported the Otay Mesa Detention Center housed more than 100 people over its contractual capacity of 1,358 detainees, citing a report from Syracruse University. Nationally, detention numbers have also spiked, with more than 65,000 people detained –  a record high.  
Over the forty days between October 1 and November 10, Otay Mesa Detention Center held an average of 1,456 people on a daily basis, about 98 people above its contractual capacity, according to ICE data and the site Detention Reports, which shows detainee population fluctuations over time at each ICE facility. 
It’s nearly impossible to determine from the data how many of those arrests occurred at immigration court hearings or check-ins, but mathematician Joseph Gunther identified 2,388 cases nationwide of people (including 76 children) who were likely arrested at immigration courthouses in May, June, and July 2025. His research paper identified 141 confirmed and likely arrests at the San Diego federal courthouse, which was the fourth highest in the country. Gunther noted the actual number of arrests was likely higher. 
Bovenzi said her husband already paid more than $2,000 in fees to file immigration-related paperwork. Now, the family is scrambling to get together another $5,000 for a potential habeas petition. 
Attorneys have increasingly used these federal lawsuits during the second Trump administration to end what they argue are illegal detentions of their immigration clients.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425-Padilla-SD-Court-AH-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

A message was sent to Kiel on Tuesday seeking additional comment.

The bill allows the public to request a list of voters and election history information from the Secretary of State’s Office from the previous 10 election cycles.According to the news release from the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office, it currently charges one cent per voter on the list.
“HB 67 is rooted in government accountability and transparency,” said Wes Allen, Secretary of State for Alabama. “Its passage will establish a clear standard by statutorily aligning the maximum cost for purchasing Alabama’s voter list with our neighboring Southeastern states.”
However, the information will exclude what the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office considers personal information, including people’s birthdays and their Social Security numbers.
Clete Welti, communications director for the Alabama House Democrats, said the changes could limit the usefulness of the list.
“Essentially, right now, someone without a lot of economic means can pretty much afford to get the voter files when running for office,” he said. “Once you get that voter file, you have got those email addresses, phone numbers, you have a physical address and age. Now, if you are saying all the information is ‘confidential,’ then all you are going to get from the Secretary of State’s Office, if this bill passes, is a list of names.”
The names, by themselves, are not useful, Welti said.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe state’s new 24% tax on all cannabis products, which was passed as a part of the fiscal year 2026 budget package, came before the Michigan Court of Claims on Tuesday, with the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association arguing that the tax was unconstitutional.
The hearing was held in Detroit on Tuesday morning.
Since its passage, the tax has been criticized by many cannabis business owners and employees, who say that it will force small retailers out of business and boost the black market.
The association is seeking an injunction to the new law, which is slated to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is hoping that its lawsuit in Michigan Cannabis Industry Association v. Michigan will result in the tax being struck down.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Specifically, the association argued that the new law seeks to change the language of the 2018 ballot proposal that legalized cannabis in the state, the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, which specifically included a 10% excise tax on all recreational marijuana purchases. The association said that because the new tax in the 2025 Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act was passed by only a simple majority vote, and not the supermajority required to amend the law put in place by the ballot initiative, the change bucked the tenets of the amendment.
“As the leading cannabis trade association, we’re here in court fighting to protect the will of Michigan voters,” Rose Tantraphol, a spokesperson for the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association, said in a statement after the hearing. “Michigan voters made their voices heard loud and clear in 2018 when they passed a citizen ballot initiative legalizing cannabis, and this 24% wholesale tax was imposed in violation of provisions in the state’s constitution.” 
In a court filing responding to the complaint and request for a preliminary injunction, the Michigan Department of Attorney General, representing the state Legislature, argued that the new 24% is not an amendment to the original sales tax on marijuana products.
“Given that the (marijuana tax act’s) excise tax is directed only at a retail transaction, the (road funding act’s) wholesale excise tax does not ‘revise, alter or amend’ the (marijuana tax act),” the filing said. 
It also notes that the 10% tax is imposed “in addition to all other taxes,” according to the law, and as such, it did not directly negate or change the initial law.
The new tax was a crucial piece of the current fiscal year’s budget, and will be used to fund road repairs and new construction, a centerpiece of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goals for her final full year in office. It passed on thin margins in the early morning hours on Oct. 1 after a months-long budget fight.
“There are limited public resources for the state and all the various decisions the state makes with the public fisc, including for Michigan’s infrastructure,” the state’s filing said. “That certain entities might have pecuniary interests that are impacted by legislation does not outweigh the public interests of Michigan’s 10-plus million citizens who travel, and should travel safely, on Michigan’s roads.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9305446-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

(Photo: Getty Images)The Latino engagement group Somos Votantes Education Fund partnered with the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt to write down $133 million of existing medical debt for people in Nevada.
Undue Medical Debt uses funding provided by donations to buy medical debt from health providers and collection agencies at steep discounts.
The 128,000 people who qualified are expected to get letters this week informing them which medical debts have been eliminated, Somos Votantes said in a press release.
“Eligible community members did not need to apply, and there was no application process,” the release said.
The move will give people in Clark and Washoe counties “much needed relief as the cost of health care continues to rise and health insurance premiums are expected to increase,” said Emmanuel Leal, the national communications and media director with Somos Votantes.
Individuals with medical debts that are more than 5% of their annual income or those earning at or below four times the federal poverty level ($62,600) qualified for relief. 
“Medical debt carries a very heavy burden on the shoulders of working families that often traps them in this sort of endless cycle of financial difficulty and stress,” Leal said. The group is hoping to secure additional relief in coming months. 
The high cost of health care, which will be exacerbated by the expiration of the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums, were a central part of the recent 43-day federal government shutdown.
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike.
The majority of Democrats refused to sign a continuing resolution to fund the government without a vote to restore the premiums or reverse Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration bill passed this summer.
Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto were among the eight Democratic Senators who broke with the majority of their caucus earlier this month to reopen the government in exchange for a promised future vote on health care costs – not a guarantee the premiums would be extended.  
An estimated 177,000 people in Nevada have medical debt according to a report from Kaiser Family Foundation.
As the cost of living increases, people are often faced with a choice between paying for health care or paying for rent or food, Leal said. 
Removing the medical debt would give them one less bill to worry about. 
Paying off a medical debt won’t take it off a credit report, said Peter Aldous, an attorney with the Consumer Rights Project at the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.
Yet, it can improve someone’s credit score and “even a small amount” of debt eliminated could be beneficial, he said. 
“That can be huge for somebody when they need to buy a car or they need to buy a house,” Aldous said. “Now they can qualify for that lower interest rate, and that’s frequently hundreds of dollars a month in savings by just bringing their credit score up a fairly small amount.”
The decision to add medical debt to credit reports “doesn’t have to be this way,” he added. 
Under President Joe Biden, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced a regulation to prevent medical debt from being included on credit reports. The Trump administration reversed that rule. 
“It’s funny because it isn’t really as strong of a political issue as you’d think or a Democrat versus Republican issue,” Aldous said. “It’s a relatively popular idea that medical debt is not something you choose to take out in the way that you take out credit card debt. You shouldn’t be punished as much for having medical debt as other kinds of debt.”
Industry, including credit agencies and lending groups, have lobbied to assure that medical debt remains on credit reports.  
Nevada Democratic state Assemblymember Max Carter proposed legislation in the regular legislative session earlier this year that sought to prohibit health care providers and collection agencies from reporting medical debt to consumer reporting agencies.
It passed in a mostly party line vote but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
Even if it did pass, Aldous said it would have likely faced pushback. 
The CPFB issued a guidance in October saying “that the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) generally preempts State laws that touch on broad areas of credit reporting”
“There are states that have laws that prohibit reporting of medical debt,” Aldous said, many which are currently being challenged. “I don’t know exactly how that’s all going to go,” he said, adding he wasn’t optimistic.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/medical-bill-past-due-getty-1024x643-1.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The company contends the law is unconstitutional.","In summary
The Wonderful Company sued to overturn a farmworker unionization law, but a California appeals court found the lawsuit was premature. The company contends the law is unconstitutional. 


California ag giant the Wonderful Company suffered a setback on Tuesday in its bid to overturn a new farmworker unionization law when an appeals court tossed its lawsuit against state labor regulators. 
The  decision by a three-judge panel of the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno leaves in place a controversial new law backed by the United Farm Workers that was meant to boost organizing in a heavily immigrant workforce. The law allows farmworkers to signal their support for union representation using a signed card, bypassing the traditional in-person, secret-ballot election usually held on the employer’s property. 
The Wonderful Company — owner of the Wonderful Pistachios brand and Fiji Water, Pom pomegranate juices and Halos oranges —filed suit against the state’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board last year trying to overturn the law, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023. 
The suit, alleging the law is unconstitutional, came after the United Farm Workers filed a petition with enough signatures to represent 600-odd workers at the company’s grape nursery in Wasco. 
In a contentious public dispute, the company accused union organizers of tricking workers into signing cards supporting unionization and provided over 100 employees’ signatures attesting to being deceived; in turn, the union accused the company of illegally intimidating workers into withdrawing their support. Regulators at the agricultural labor board filed charges against Wonderful after investigating the claims. 
All of those allegations were being heard before the labor board last spring when Wonderful took the matter to court, arguing the new law deprived the company of due process. A Kern County judge initially halted the board proceedings, but the appeals court allowed them to continue last fall. After weeks of hearings this year, the labor board has yet to issue a decision on whether UFW can represent Wonderful employees. 
In the meantime, the company has shuttered the Wasco nursery and donated it to UC Davis, making the question of an actual union at the worksite moot. 
In the new ruling, the appeals court judges issued a sharp rebuke of the company for suing over the unionization instead of waiting for the labor board decision. 
“Wonderful filed this petition notwithstanding approximately 50 years of unbroken precedent finding an employer may not directly challenge a union certification decision in court except in extraordinarily and exceedingly rare circumstances, which Wonderful does not meaningfully attempt to show are present here,” wrote Justice Rosendo Peña. 
Elizabeth Strater, a United Farm Workers vice president, said the decision affirms that “every farm worker in California has rights under the law, and those rights need to be protected.”
But Wonderful Company General Counsel Craig Cooper dismissed the ruling as only a matter of timing:  “the decision explicitly does not address the merits of Wonderful Nurseries’ constitutional challenge.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/080322_UFWmarch_LV_CM_033.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

Teresa Leger Fernández visited the burn scar to brainstorm next steps and meet with a family whose well is contaminated with heavy metals.,"Darleen and Johnathan Ortiz have faced one challenge after another in the aftermath of the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Darleen and Johnathan Ortiz built their fire-proofed home a decade ago high in the forest in Mora County along the Rio de La Casa, which carried enough water down the mountain to feed an acequia and water the vegetables in their greenhouse. 
Early signs indicated the drinking water was as clean as the surroundings were idyllic. The Ortizes tested their private well several times, including to certify their lettuce as organic for sale at a local market, and never detected anything unusual. 
That all changed in 2022 when the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire raged through the area. While their home avoided damage, the fire destroyed 19 structures higher in the watershed and post-fire debris flows carried ash and contaminants down the river. Flooding also changed the path of the river, making it bypass the acequia’s headgate. 
Over the last few years, with the help of various state and federal agencies and nonprofit organizations, the Ortizes restored a level of normalcy. A 10-foot-deep concrete wall that replaced an eroding embankment helped reconnect the river and acequia. Crews downed and removed 800 burned trees, and in their place grew mint, yerba buena and wild raspberries, welcome surprises that the Ortizes enjoyed this summer.

Martin Zamora (R-Clovis), right, around her property, where recent tests discovered contaminants in the groundwater. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
“We tried to do the best that we can,” Johnathan told Source New Mexico on Tuesday as the Rio de la Casa trickled along the brand new concrete below him. “But it just seems that once you get a little bit ahead, there’s just another blow, which is now the well water situation. Now we’re eating on paper plates and really not drinking the well water and that kind of thing. So it’s just one hurdle after another.”
The Ortizes’ private well stands among 72 in the area that recently tested positive for dangerous levels of heavy metals. Kate Zeigler, the independent geologist who discovered the contaminants, has pointed to fire suppressants as the likely culprit. Recently, Zeigler hand-delivered the couple results of her latest round of testing, showing their well had high levels of arsenic, aluminum, manganese and antimony. 
According to a presentation Zeigler gave Tuesday at a library in Mora, at least 400 private wells exist in the burn scar, including about 100 that are not registered with the state. The county also has public wells. County officials have said that the latest samples show no contaminants in public drinking water wells, though they noted Tuesday they are waiting for updated test results from the United States Geological Survey.

Testing the remaining burn scar wells, as well as soil and surface water testing, emerged as a key next step during the meeting, which U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández convened. She joined a handful of state lawmakers from both parties, along with local elected officials and advocates, to discuss the potential sources and extent of the contamination, along with where money might come from to pay for testing and remediation. 
FEMA says NM fire victims will have to prove ‘causation’ to get payment for well contamination

Zeigler said the best tests to capture all of the potential contaminants cost as much as $2,000 a sample, though efforts are in the works to provide free testing, she said. State Environment Department officials collected names of private well owners at a recent community meeting, and they pointed well owners to a list of companies that provide testing. 
Drew Goretzka, a spokesperson for the Environment Department, told Source New Mexico in an email the agency is conducting additional testing, which Zeigler said Tuesday should begin “soon.” Lawmakers like Sen. Pat Woods (R-Broadview) also suggested the Legislature could approve new funding at the 30-day session beginning in January.

Leger Fernández also reiterated her criticism that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees an office with a $5.45 billion compensation fund for fire victims, stop “hedging” about whether it will compensate fire victims for the newly discovered contamination. She called on them to join an emerging partnership between state and local entities, along with her office, that is trying to find solutions. 
FEMA officials told Source New Mexico on Friday that the claims office would consider claims for damages related to the contamination, but only if claimants prove “injuries and causation.” What exactly that could mean is one of many uncertainties attendees described Tuesday. 
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

“I wrote that darn law,” Leger Fernández said of the bill creating the compensation fund. “And this is the kind of thing they should have been covering.”
In the meantime, the Ortizes’ are now afraid of their drinking water and wondering how far the contaminants have spread, perhaps even to the raspberries that at first seemed a post-fire blessing. Meeting attendees stopped by the Ortizes’ property as the last stop on their visit Tuesday, where Darleen wondered aloud about how she’ll handle the latest crisis since the fire three and a half years ago. 
“Without water, gosh, I don’t know,” Darleen said. 
“I thought about the mint that I had picked there,” she said, pointing toward one of the wellheads Zeigler tested. “And I was making little tea bags for my family for Christmas, and I’m thinking to myself, is it okay to give it to them?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1370-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

(Photo by Lauren Sausser/KFF Health News)BOILING SPRINGS — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied more than 1,700 measles cases and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and Kansas. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
Schools and ‘small brush fires’
Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before COVID,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine
requirements, according to data published by the state.
Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.

Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain.
The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago.
During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to data published by The Post and Courier. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
Some schools are more exposed than others.
The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.


‘Health freedom’
In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.”
“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, of course, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates.
“I know measles is a serious disease and is highly contagious, but the answer to that is to make sure that the people, the parents, have all the information they need and have accurate information and let them make what they think is the right decision,” he told reporters, adding, “We’re not going to have mandates. And I think that we are responding properly.”
Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.
In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a COVID-19 vaccine with a free beer or soda.
By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
Dr. Edward Simmer, McMaster’s appointed interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak.
During a legislative hearing in April, Republican senators voted against his permanent confirmation to lead the newly separate agency amid false allegations about his response to the COVID-19 pandemic and his promotion of vaccines.
One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
‘Outrageously false’: Nominated SC health director defends COVID response over opponents’ claims

It was a stark contrast to Simmer’s first confirmation process in 2021, when senators voted 40-1 amid the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to put the retired Navy doctor in charge of what was then the Department of Health and Environmental Control.
Public health officials in other states have been blocked from new roles because of their COVID-19 response.
In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
Following South Carolina senators’ 5-12 vote in April to reject Simmer’s confirmation, McMaster continued to back his nominee, leaving Simmer on as interim director indefinitely.
Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for COVID-19 vaccines.
But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective if the Republican Party became just reflectively against vaccines as a matter of policy.”
The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24.
But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”

Photographs by John Partipilo/Tennessee LookoutFederal officials announced a new crime hotline for residents of Memphis public housing Monday, the latest facet of a task force that deployed federal and state law enforcement in the city starting in early October.
U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner said the hotline is meant to provide residents of HUD-funded housing a direct line to report “criminals, illegal aliens, sex offenders, human traffickers and those guilty of gang activity, drug distribution and fraud.”
Calls will go to the HUD Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, waste and abuse in government-subsidized housing. The office will coordinate with the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, and state and local law enforcement, Turner said.
Turner specifically singled out immigrants lacking permanent legal status in his remarks. 
“We will clean up our public housing so that they can fulfill their function of sanctuaries for the most vulnerable people in our country, where American citizens can get a temporary hand up and then gain independence from government help — specifically American citizens,” he said. 
“Illegal aliens have no place in public housing,” Turner continued. “It’s outrageous that people who should not be here come across our borders and now usurp spots in housing units that should support American people.”
Immigrants without permanent legal status are ineligible for federal housing programs under current federal law, with narrow exceptions for emergency or disaster services, according to the National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant advocacy organization.
Mixed-status families — families with members of different immigration statuses — can still receive housing assistance from HUD, so long as the household has at least one eligible member. The amount of assistance these families receive is prorated, so a household with ineligible members will receive only a portion of the rent subsidy that a household would receive if every member were eligible, according to a HUD report published in 2019.
These mixed-status families make up less than 1% of all households receiving assistance in the United States, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. HUD’s 2019 report records roughly 25,000 mixed-status households, with the majority consisting of three eligible members and one ineligible member.
Federal, state officials tout task force numbers, but do not provide detailed data
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Monday that the Memphis Safe Task Force has tallied more than 3,100 arrests, seized 501 firearms, and located 121 children reported as missing. Federal charges have been filed against 157 people, Bondi said.
Gov. Bill Lee and U.S. Sens. Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn also heaped praise on the task force, which was convened by the Trump administration in September.
But various agencies involved in the task force, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Tennessee Highway Patrol, have yet to publicly release the names of all of the individuals arrested under the task force’s purview, or provide details about their charges.
Arrest counts provided by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Marshals Service initially included a breakdown by category, including homicides, sex offenses, narcotics, firearms, probation/parole violations, ICE administrative warrants, “other” and “warrants.” In the task force’s first week, ICE administrative warrants made up roughly 25% of reported arrests. The agencies have since stopped providing counts for immigration-related arrests.
A data dashboard published by the Shelby County General Sessions Court shows that, while the number of new cases involving traffic violations and drug charges has risen since the task force began, the number of new cases involving violent crime charges has fallen. 
The number of warrants served has increased, and University of Memphis Center for Community Research and Evaluation Associate Director Jonathan Bennett, who worked on the dashboard, told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism earlier this month that arrests connected to pre-existing warrants are “likely a key focus of the task force’s efforts with respect to violent offenders.”
The task force cleared more than 1,000 warrants as of Nov. 9, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The agency periodically posts news releases announcing task force arrests for select individuals facing charges involving drugs, violent crime and illegal firearms, among other charges.
The Department of Homeland Security provided names and photographs of 11 “criminal illegal aliens” that it described as “some of the worst of the worst” arrested by the task force in October, but recent reporting from the Institute for Public Service Reporting shows some of the individuals were misidentified and others had charges that were unable to be verified through an independent search of court records. 
One of the people identified was Christian worship singer Delmar Gomez, whom authorities falsely claimed had been arrested on an aggravated assault charge. Gomez’ record shows only minor motor vehicle violations.
Officials address cost and strain on criminal justice system
Hagerty said he wants the Memphis Safe Task Force to act as a template for law enforcement surges in other U.S. cities. He acknowledged that additional funding will be needed to sustain the operation. 
A federal memo submitted in a legal challenge to the National Guard’s presence in Memphis estimated salaries and benefits for up to 1,000 National Guard members present in Memphis as part of the task force could cost $226 million per year. Additional costs associated with the task force are unclear. A Nashville chancellor temporarily blocked the Guard’s presence, but her ruling remains on hold while the state appeals.
Hagerty addressed Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who will “have a big job in this as a member of the Appropriations Committee.”
As speaker, Sexton can sit on any House committee, but he does not have a fixed seat on the House Appropriations Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Bud Hulsey, a Kingsport Republican.
“At the federal level, we’re going to be doing everything that we can to make certain that we have the proper resources going forward so that we’re able to maintain the safety of Memphis, to bring back the greatness of this wonderful city,” Hagerty said.
Representatives for Hagerty and Sexton did not respond to a request for clarification on these remarks.
The influx of arrests is straining local court systems and adding to overcrowding at the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center, according to District Attorney General Steve Mulroy. 
The task force has “substantially increased the caseload of our office,” Mulroy wrote in a Nov. 21 newsletter. “Daily General Sessions Court dockets are up about 50%. We’ve started to see significant rises in other areas as well. We’re reassigning prosecutors from regular duty to Traffic Court duty to deal with the deluge of traffic cases soon to hit our court.”
Several prosecutors have volunteered to work evenings, weekends and extra hours, Mulroy reported.
Gadyaces Serralta, director of the U.S. Marshals Service, said Monday that the task force is “taking every case we can federal” in an attempt to relieve some of the strain on local courts. 
Serralta also said that criminal cases are “taking too long to see their way through the wheels of justice” in state courts, and his agency is “open to working with the state prosecutor’s office in order to shorten that period of time.”
“If we don’t speed up the process, it’s going to continue to back up,” he said. “Because we can’t put them through the criminal justice system does not mean that it’s a free pass to commit crimes, so we’re going to keep arresting folks. They keep committing crimes, we’re going to keep arresting them.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC05728-copy-DeNoiseAI-clear-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sophie Bowater: The Fish & Wildlife Department should give us a seat at the table.","Dear Editor,


I’m writing in response to VTDigger’s recent article about the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department’s proposal to charge a public access license in recognition of declining hunting, fishing and trapping licenses.
I would support this proposal if Fish & Wildlife were also willing to reexamine and reform the outdated and unrepresentative Fish & Wildlife Board. As VTDigger has noted, in this article, S.258 would modernize the Board’s composition and decision-making — a critical step toward fairness and accountability.
There is no reason the Fish & Wildlife Board should continue operating like a private game club where a small minority controls the process.

READ MORE

Many Vermonters, myself included, used to attend Board meetings and offer public comment, but stopped participating after realizing that those in charge had little interest in listening to non-consumptive voices. Some of the Board members referred to us as “bunny huggers,”, in what appeared to be an attempt to further marginalize us.
If the Department truly wants to update its model in recognition of the fact that fewer people are hunting, fishing and trapping, then it must make a good-faith effort to work collaboratively with non-consumptive Vermonters. By all means, charge us a reasonable fee — but give us a seat at the table where decisions are made. Only then can we work together on the future of conservation in Vermont.
Transformation isn’t just about collecting new fees from the public; it’s about showing Vermonters that their values matter. The Department must address the widespread lack of trust in its leadership and demonstrate that it represents all who care about Vermont’s wildlife and natural lands.
Sincerely,
Sophie Bowater,

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Indiana’s application for a share of the federal government’s $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program lays out a sweeping, multi-year plan to stabilize struggling hospitals, expand essential local services and overhaul primary care in health systems across the state’s 64 rural counties.
The 167-page submission — obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle — details the state’s strategy, branded “GROW: Cultivating Hoosier Health.”
The plan is described as a “collaborative effort” to be jointly led by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration and the Indiana Department of Health.
It outlines 12 major initiatives, including a statewide patient-transfer coordination hub, significant upgrades to Indiana’s health information exchange, and large new regional grants intended to reshape how rural care is delivered.
The proposal was submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Nov. 4, one day before the deadline for all 50 states, as required under the law creating the program. Awards must be issued to states by Dec. 31.
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a five-year federal initiative, with states receiving annual allocations of both formula and competitive funding throughout that period.
Half of the annual $10 billion in federal funding will be divided evenly among states with approved plans. The rest will be awarded competitively based on need, program design and federal scoring criteria.
Urgent needs in rural communities
Indiana has 52 rural hospitals, 25% of which have already cut services, according to the Centers for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Rural Hoosiers experience higher rates of chronic disease, fewer local specialists and repeated closures of maternity and emergency services.
The state also conducted a large rural health survey — drawing more than 2,100 responses — to assess local challenges around access, provider shortages, technology gaps, food insecurity and transportation barriers.

Respondents cited long travel times to care, lack of specialty access, difficulty managing chronic conditions and limited behavioral health services as top concerns.
Story continues below.
RHTP Narrative (State of Indiana) FINAL
 
Indiana’s proposal is organized around 12 multi-year initiatives aimed at expanding care access, modernizing technology, improving outcomes for chronic disease, strengthening emergency and maternity care, supporting behavioral health workforce development and distributing large regional grants.
Proposed “Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again Regional Grants” are the plan’s largest investment. The state’s application proposed awarding $600 million over five years across eight regions, with each receiving $40 million to $100 million.
The grant program would require each regional coalition to file a unified application that includes a needs assessment, data-sharing plans, service-delivery innovations, detailed budgets, letters of support and measurable health-performance objectives. 
Required outcomes include improved maternal health, reduced preventable emergency department visits, increased telehealth utilization and better chronic disease control.
Regions would be judged competitively, with awards based on population served, strength of partnerships, evidence of innovation and sustainability and plans to reduce duplication in services. A dedicated state support team would train regions, review data, and provide ongoing technical assistance.
Improved technology and training
A different initiative would create a Medical Operations Coordination Center, described in the state’s application as a “24/7 hub for day-to-day hospital operational reporting, patient transfer coordination, and EMS resource alignment.”
The initiative also includes analysis of a Medicaid payment model tailored to rural hospitals.
(Presentation slide from the Indiana Rural Health Transformation Program Grant Application Working Group’s November 2025 meeting)
The estimated cost is $56.2 million over five years, according to the application.
Another initiative seeks to modernize Indiana’s health information infrastructure. The state’s health information exchange, or HIE, is the central network that allows hospitals and providers to share patient records electronically. It currently connects about 120 hospitals but leaves roughly 700 rural facilities outside the system, creating major gaps in care coordination.
Indiana officials proposed connecting 450 of those facilities and testing artificial intelligence tools for predictive analytics, natural language processing and reducing medical errors.
The initiative carries an estimated cost of $66.5 million over five years, which includes incentives to help rural facilities adopt required technology and fully integrate with the HIE.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The application further outlines a plan to launch eight rural cardiometabolic care sites statewide through a “collaborative care model” and training programs, targeting Indiana’s high rates of diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The initiative is budgeted at $15.3 million over five years, covering staffing, care-team development and the establishment of new rural treatment sites.
Amid widespread loss of maternity units, a different part of the plan supports hospitals and EMS agencies seeking “Pediatric Ready” and “OB Ready” designations.
Pediatric Ready status means an emergency department has the staff, equipment and protocols to stabilize and treat critically ill children, and the OB Ready designation reflects similar preparedness for obstetric emergencies and coordination with perinatal centers, according to state health officials.
The application noted that pediatric readiness is associated with a reduction in pediatric mortality risk by up to 76%.
The effort would cost an estimated cost of $45.4 million over five years.
Also in the pitch is an expansion of Indiana’s rural behavioral health training tracks and workforce stipends. The goal, according to state officials, is to increase the “local hire rate in rural communities” and support graduates who “work locally post-graduation for the required five-year period.” The behavioral health workforce initiative is budgeted at $5.3 million.
An emphasis on collaboration
The application repeatedly stressed stakeholder involvement and cited application input from multiple Hoosier offices and groups, including Indiana’s Office of Community and Rural Affairs, Department of Transportation, Department of Homeland Security, tribal groups, managed care entities, the Indiana Rural Health Association, hospital systems and numerous clinical and community organizations.
The federal rural health program was created alongside sweeping federal Medicaid reductions.
Federal spending is projected to fall by about $1 trillion over 10 years, with rural areas expected to lose $155 billion. Nationally, more than half of rural hospitals are operating at a loss, and states across the country are submitting similarly expansive proposals as they compete for the same pool of competitive federal funding.
Health groups warn that Indiana’s rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid and often operate on thin margins due to low reimbursement rates.
If the federal government approves Indiana’s plan, grants and formula funds will begin flowing in 2026. The state’s internal schedule shows regional grant applications opening in March 2026, with awards finalized by October.

There is a deep bench of candidates from both parties, and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has set aside his lifelong affiliation with the Democratic party to launch an independent bid for the state’s top office. The dynamic has led some to question whether a third party candidate could garner enough support to secure the governorship. 
Although control of the governor’s office has flipped back and forth over the past 40 years, a strong showing among Democrats this November amid frustration with President Donald Trump’s policies could signal a potential shift in that dynamic.

Here’s the Advance’s breakdown of the race thus far, with details on each candidate and current fundraising totals.
The Democrats
Heading into election year, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla. Mayor Marni Sawicki make up the slate of Democrats aiming to hold onto the executive seat in Lansing.
Benson has emerged as an early favorite amongst Democrats, retaining a cash advantage over her opponents as well as a commanding lead in internal polling with strong recognition over Gilchrist and Swanson.

Jocelyn Benson
Over her tenure as secretary of state, Benson has overseen elections with record-setting turnout and helped implement new laws initiated by Michigan voters aimed at improving access to the ballot box. She has focused on protecting voting rights, to ensure all Michiganders can cast a vote regardless of their race, gender, faith or sexuality.
Benson has also secured endorsements from several state lawmakers, as well as the campaign finance reform group End Citizens United, EMILYs List, Vote Mama PAC,  the Progressive Women’s Alliance, and labor groups including the Michigan Laborers District Council, the Association of Flight Attendants, UA Local 174, Teamsters Local 243 and 406 and UFCW 876 and 951.
Campaign finance reports filed with the state in October show Benson’s campaign has raised the most of any Democratic candidate, bringing in $4.75 million and spending $1.76 million, leaving her with $2.98 million on hand.

Garlin Gilchrist
Serving as Whitmer’s second-in-command since 2019, Gilchrist is the state’s first Black lieutenant governor. If successful in the primary and the general election, Gilchrist would also be the state’s first Black governor. 
A Detroit native and former software engineer for Microsoft, Gilchrist has carried forward the Whitmer administration’s goals of growing businesses and economic opportunities in the state to attract families and retain Michigan graduates. Gilchrist also broke with his competitors in calling Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide, pledging not to accept campaign funding from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobbying group in the U.S. 
He has won endorsements from U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), Democratic National Committee Black Caucus Chair Virgie Rollins and several state lawmakers.Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Gilchrist’s campaign has raised just under $1.13 million and spent $748,632, leaving the campaign with $378,457 on hand.

Chris Swanson
Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson made national headlines in 2020 after taking off his riot gear to walk alongside protestors speaking out against police brutality after the killing of George Floyd. Now he’s looking to be Michigan’s next governor.
Swanson has pledged to protect, serve and unify, telling attendees at his campaign announcement that he would bring a “customer service mindset” to state government. Swanson has also called for support to small business by creating an Office of Innovation, and for the adoption of a statewide model of his office’s  Genesee County Human Oppression Strike Team, which works to combat human trafficking.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Swanson’s campaign has raised $1.36 million and spent $975,997, leaving the campaign with $385,189 on hand.
Marni Sawicki
A Battle Creek native, Sawicki announced her campaign for governor in March, promising a focus on government transparency. 
In her announcement, Sawicki offered her transparency plan, which would  include regular public performance dashboards for all state departments, livestreamed and recorded board/committee meetings and decision-making sessions, a searchable database of all state contracts and expenditures, mandatory ethics training for all elected officials and state employees and require public lobbying logs documenting all meetings between elected officials and lobbyists. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Sawicki’s campaign has brought in $15,930, and spent $14,605, leaving the campaign with $1,324 on hand.

The Independent
Mike Duggan
Breaking away from the Democratic Party, Duggan is looking to shake up an increasingly divided political system citing the “toxic and personal” nature of today’s politics in his decision to forgo a campaign from within the two major parties.
Duggan has pitched his campaign as a balm to the partisan arguments barring government from addressing the issues facing the state, but his split from the Democrats has brought plenty of hurt feelings, as members of Duggan’s former party have gone on the offensive, accusing him of cozying up to Republican donors and labelling him a spoiler candidate who could draw votes away from Democrats. Polling released in October showing Duggan closing the gap with the top Democratic and Republicans candidates. 
He has also secured the support of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce, Lansing Regional Chamber, the Southeast Michigan Chamber of Commerce, several Detroit area unions and former U.S. Rep. Dave Trott (R-Commerce Township), among others. Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Duggan’s campaign has brought in nearly $4.38 million and spent more than $1.96 million leaving the campaign with more than $2.4 million cash on hand.
The Republicans
With a crowded slate of candidates and no clear frontrunner, signs are pointing to a messy primary for Republicans headed into 2026. 
While U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) emerged as an early frontrunner in the race, but interest in the second term Republican could be fleeting. A straw poll conducted among members of the Michigan Republican Party placed James at fourth amid his competitors and other names floated for governor.
James was notably absent from a gubernatorial forum hosted by the Michigan Republican Party at its biannual conference on Mackinac Island, and his absence from the Michigan Republican Party’s first gubernatorial debate prompted immediate criticism from his opponents, with supporters of Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) bringing milk cartons bearing a missing poster with James’ likeness on the side.

John James
Opting against a third term in the U.S. House, James announced in April that he would instead seek the top spot in Lansing, arguing that “It’s time to get Michigan’s government out of fantasyland and back to common sense,” while touting his ties to Trump. 
If elected, James would be Michigan’s first Black governor.
James’ campaign lists affordability as his top priority, with the representative  promising a focus on kids and families in education, a reduction in regulations on business and support for law enforcement while opposing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within government.

(Photo by Michele Jokinen, House Public Information.)Three-term state Rep. Sandra Feist, DFL-New Brighton, recently announced she will not seek re-election in 2026.
Feist was known for her willingness to take on some of the Legislature’s most complex tasks, sorting through thorny issues like property tax forfeiture laws. 
Feist was a vice chair on the Public Safety Finance and Policy committee. She authored laws including a ban on mandatory juvenile life sentences without parole; modernizing Minnesota’s community supervision funding formula; and updating Minnesota’s guardianship system.
Feist is a member of the Legislature’s Civility Caucus, a group of Republican and Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers who meet regularly to socialize and find common ground. 
As an immigration attorney, she works with both employment-based cases — professionals, medical researchers, athletes — and families seeking to sponsor relatives to become legal residents. 
The Reformer spoke with Feist about her decision to leave the Legislature, her ideas about how to fix the U.S. immigration system and her advice for future lawmakers. 
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you decide not to run for re-election? What are you planning to do with the time you will get back from not being in the Legislature?
I have basically been doing two full-time jobs for the last five years, and I just feel that my immigration practice really is demanding all of my time and emotional energy. I don’t believe in doing anything halfway, and I didn’t want to be a legislator who wasn’t able to make the commitment that my constituents deserve — to have my full attention and all of my energy, so I had to make that decision.
In addition to refocusing my energy on my immigration work, I also have two kids and I’m looking forward to spending more time with them. I used to think that every politician who retired and said they wanted to spend more time with their family were lying, and there was some sort of sex scandal behind it, but now I’m realizing that it’s a huge sacrifice — and it’s a worthy sacrifice — but it’s a sacrifice that the whole family makes. 
I also write romance novels, and I’m looking forward to writing and reading and being a creative person again. The work of the Legislature and the work of being an immigration lawyer and doing both of those at the same time really doesn’t leave you with a lot of creative time.
What are you hearing from immigrants these days, especially from professionals who have existing visas? Are they feeling under threat right now?
Yes, absolutely, every single one of them and all of their employers. The visible parts of the immigration crackdown get most of the attention, but there are so many ways in which people who are coming here for work, who have been here for their work for decades, are having the rug pulled out from underneath them, and are being told that they are no longer wanted and that their extensions of status for the 10th time are going to be scrutinized and maybe not approved anymore. So it’s really dire for all types of immigrants.
In your mind, what does the best version of the U.S. immigration system look like?
What I would love to see is an immigration system that can breathe — so expand and contract strategically to address the modern realities. 
So what that means is that when we look at humanitarian immigration, what is the percentage of displaced people in the world right now? What are the factors that are driving people to flee from their homes? Then adjusting our refugee admissions based on that. 
It also means looking at unemployment rates in the United States. Where are there sectors of the economy, such as agriculture or technology, where we don’t have enough workers, or we don’t have the right workers, and how can we expand our immigration system to address that? 
A system like that would also then contract if it’s a situation where we don’t need certain types of immigrants in certain areas of the economy. If we could create a system that adjusts, say, every 10 years, then we wouldn’t have to wait on Congress to develop the political will and consensus to make those adjustments over time. Right now, we have an immigration system that was created in large part in 1965 and updated somewhat in 1990 and really hasn’t been adjusted to adapt over the decades otherwise. And that’s bad.
What are you most proud of from your time in the Legislature?
I am really proud of the work that I’ve done on really gnarly issues where there are many stakeholders and impacted people, and they all have different priorities and concerns, and I bring people together to have productive conversation and negotiations and come to a consensus around workable solutions. 
In 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court found Minnesota’s property tax forfeiture laws unconstitutional and said they had to be totally recreated. And that is a really huge issue that impacts counties. It impacts people who are advocates for the constitutional protections against the government just taking your property and not compensating you. It has a huge impact on the work that local governments do around environmental remediation, and it’s just had a huge financial impact on local governments. So when we were told that our entire property tax forfeiture system needed to be recreated, that created just a lot of heartburn and headache and complexity. 
So I was able to bring together all of these parties who had really strong opinions and concerns. And every single decision we made, we had to re-read the Supreme Court decision and make sure that what we were doing was constitutional, and then we had to talk to the judicial branch and make sure that everything was practical. We came up with a structure that is workable and constitutional and everybody was happy with, and it’s one of those things that, like, people won’t see. They won’t understand what was done and how it impacts them, but they will never have their property taken without being compensated, and counties won’t go bankrupt because of the way we did it. And it’s just and we’re not violating the Constitution anymore, and that’s good. 
The property tax forfeiture reform that I led — (the late Rep.) Melissa Hortman asked me to. She said, this is like a Sandra thing, you know, bringing together a bunch of people over a really complicated, technical, legal issue.
Really complicated, thorny, not-very-sexy bills were kind of my specialty. I did some sexy ones too. But I’m most proud of the technical bills.
My former colleague Deena Winter wrote about your involvement in the Civility Caucus in 2024, before President Donald Trump was elected to his second term. There’s a sentiment among some people on the left who would say that given the actions of the Republican Party and the Trump administration — for example on immigration — that now is not the time for civility or bipartisan collaboration. What’s your response to that?
I feel very passionately that civility is always the answer, and I think that when we have disputes, it’s because we’re defining civility differently. So civility does not mean that we do not acknowledge and confront the differences of opinion and the things that people say that are hurtful or hateful. Civility means that we have dialogue with people who have differences of opinion and build relationships with them so that we can have that dialogue. 
No movement has ever succeeded by berating and insulting and ostracizing the people that they disagree with. If we are not in dialogue — if we cannot see one another’s humanity — then we can’t succeed in ever changing hearts and minds. And so I feel very strongly that if I am able to have a meal with colleagues with whom I passionately disagree on certain issues, that that builds a level of trust and mutual respect that allows us to have more difficult conversations. This is not theoretical. Like, I have seen this happen — I am able to have really difficult conversations with people with whom I disagree, because we’ve built a base of understanding of one another. I think it is counterproductive to say that we need to ostracize the people with whom we passionately disagree.
What is your advice for future legislators?
One of the things that I have found most rewarding in my time as a legislator is corresponding with constituents and hearing from them. That’s one of those things that you don’t see in the news. It’s not a passionate floor speech, it’s not a press conference, it’s not even a bill — but I have received emails from people who said I was the first politician who ever responded to them, and I have a lot of email correspondence with people with whom I disagree that has been really productive and thought provoking, hopefully on both sides. I hope that whoever comes next to my seat, and all legislators, will remember that communication with constituents and making them feel seen and heard and lifting up their voices in our work is a central aspect to being a legislator.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Feist031224-0219MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.
The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat – even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.
Yet, huge amounts of food – on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it – rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.
This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane – a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.
As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.
 Immigration policy

Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.
The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers – with lethal consequences at times.
Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.
News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”
 Foreign aid cuts

When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.
Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.
An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.
 Tariffs

In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.
And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.
Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.
 Other efforts lead to more waste

Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens – which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.
In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.
Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters – including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.
The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients – to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.
Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies – though they claim to be seeking efficiency – have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food – as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.

A preliminary report on New Mexico’s Nov. 4 local elections found that Election Day voting in general went smoothly in every corner of the state — and offered suggestions on how election officials can improve next year. The findings came just hours before the State Canvass Board unanimously certified the official results of this year’s elections and ordered automatic recounts in 34 races throughout the state.
The findings from Observe New Mexico Elections, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for transparency in elections, reflect the observations of 111 volunteers at 106 polling sites across 11 New Mexico counties. The organization’s full findings are expected to be issued in a more exhaustive January report.
“In general, polls opened and closed on time and experienced minimal disruptions to voting in the locations we observed,” Observe New Mexico Elections co-leader Carmen López said in a statement. “Of course, there are always areas for improvement. Observers noted that counties generally did not train poll workers on how to meet federal and state requirements related to translation and interpretation services, posting clearer signage, and providing required accommodations for people with disabilities. That’s why this effort is so important — nonpartisan observation helps show what’s working well and where election processes can be improved and made more consistent and accessible.”
Report: NM 2024 election well-run, but overwhelmed by same-day registration

The report focused on five key areas of elections: logic and accuracy testing, poll worker training, absentee ballot processing, early in-person voting and Election Day voting.
Logic and accuracy testing refers to the computers that tally and read voters’ ballots. Before an election, county clerks test their voting machines to ensure they count without any errors. The Tuesday report from ONME found that election officials clearly followed standard procedures on these tests and noted that, in a few instances, polling locations lacked a space where members of the public could comfortably observe this process.
Poll worker trainings across the state were “professional, organized, and welcoming,” according to the report, and workers learned “how to open and operate polling locations, issue and process ballots, and close the polls.” While the overall quality of the trainings was strong, the report said that observers saw some trainers truncating the sessions when many of the poll workers had served in previous elections. Trainers also rarely fully explained accessibility and language-related voter accommodations, the report said.
Absentee ballot processing was “well-organized, transparent, and secure in all three locations observed,” according to the report. It noted that physical accessibility to the facility was limited in Las Cruces.
Early in-person voting largely went smoothly, though observers noted that some voting sites “lacked instructions inside voting booths about how to cast a ballot or information about spoiled and provisional ballots.” Also of concern: Such information was not always posted in several languages, even in areas where the Voting Rights Act requires it. 
Voting on Election Day generally went well, but observers reported that some locations did not display information “about how to complete a ballot, what to do if they made a mistake, or how to contact election officials” and that some only posted information in English. In a handful of cases, voters did not clearly understand district boundaries and left without voting, according to the report.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Voting-booths-UNM-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

Under Acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire, the federal government filed motions in U.S. District Court to vacate a 30-month sentence against Cade Cothren and a 36-month sentence for Casada when President Donald Trump granted them pardons Nov. 7.
The move by prosecutors to vacate the convictions isn’t considered necessary because the presidential pardon leads to the same outcome.

Without pardons, Casada and Cothren were to report to prison Nov. 21 and Nov. 14, respectively.

With enhanced subsidies due to expire on Dec. 31, many Missourians are weighing their options for coverage in 2026 (krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images).Until last year, Roberta Ross-Fisher had never been in a hospital except to visit friends and family.
The self-employed higher education consultant from Franklin County was so diligent about cleaning her teeth she had a gum graft several years ago to repair where she overbrushed.
Then, on May 5, 2024, she received a phone call. She had cancer in her lower jaw.
She took time off work and underwent surgery to remove the cancer and reconstruct her mandible with bone from her fibula. Now in remission, she gets CT scans and sees her oncologist every few months.
“That’s non-negotiable, whether I have insurance or whether I don’t,” Ross-Fisher said.
What is also non-negotiable is the premium she’ll pay to remain in a health insurance plan she purchases through the federal marketplace. This year, it’s $295 per month. Next year, if Congress extends current subsidies, it will be $479. 
And if the subsidies go away Jan. 1, the price will be $1,216 per month, a 312% increase.
It is enough to give her pause, despite needing cancer follow-up care. Ross-Fisher in 2026 will qualify for Medicare, the federal insurance program for older and disabled adults.
“I’ve been having conversations with my husband,” she said. “What do I do? I’m now a cancer patient. Do I risk going for six months without insurance?”
The conversation Ross-Fisher is having with her husband is the same one being held in thousands of households across Missouri.
The open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act plans opened Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 16. For some, the extra costs for 2026 will mean they go without coverage. 
Others may look for alternatives, such as Missouri Farm Bureau health coverage that does not qualify as an insurance plan under federal definitions. Backers promised it would be cheaper when lawmakers passed the law this year, but no one interested in buying into the plan will know if they will truly save money until it launches Jan. 1.
And the uncertainty makes financial planning more difficult for medical providers.
Care for people on marketplace plans represents about 2% of the revenue for University of Missouri Health Care, said Greg Damron, chief financial officer for MU Health Care in Columbia. 
“That doesn’t sound like a lot,” Damron said, “but if you think about it, when you’re trying to get to a 4% margin or something, 2% of your revenues is kind of a big deal.” 
 Enhanced subsidies

For 43 days, Democrats in the U.S. Senate used the filibuster to keep the federal government shut down in an effort to preserve the enhanced subsidies enacted as a COVID-19 emergency measure in 2021. 
Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the actual premiums paid by lower-income people purchasing individual health plans through the federal marketplace were capped as a share of their income. At the lowest end of the income scale, the cap was 2.1%, rising to 9.96% for people between three and four times the federal poverty level, or between $46,950 and $62,600 for a single person.
The enhanced subsidies reduced those caps so people at the lowest end paid no out-of-pocket premiums and no person purchasing an individual plan paid more than 8.5% of their income.
The enhanced subsidies expire Dec. 31. The U.S. Senate will vote in December on a bill extending the subsidies, but there’s no promise of a similar vote in the U.S. House and no indication President Donald Trump would sign it if passed.
Missouri health premiums to rise as much as 30% for 2026 amid uncertainty over subsidies

One result of the enhanced subsidies was dramatic growth in the number of Missourians covered by ACA plans at the same time Medicaid enrollment declined as eligibility reviews began following a freeze tied to the COVID-19 emergency.
In 83% of Missouri counties, an analysis from Washington University shows, new enrollments in marketplace plans exceeded the decline in Medicaid enrollment.
“The rapid growth in marketplace enrollment likely was influenced by enhanced premium tax credits (EPTCs), which were passed in 2021 and significantly lowered the out-of-pocket premiums recipients pay for the marketplace plans,” the analysis states. 
There are more than 417,000 people in Missouri covered by marketplace plans, up from 257,000 in 2023. Faced with double-digit increases in base premiums and the loss of enhanced subsidies, many may drop health insurance entirely.
“Without that premium support, the belief out there is that it’s largely going to hit younger, lower-income people,” Damron said. “They’re likely going to be the folks that also decide to opt out of insurance coverage altogether.”
 Small business worries

Small businesses that provide health insurance are also facing tough choices — whether to pass more costs to employees or stop offering coverage altogether, said Brad Jones, Missouri lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
The small group rates approved this fall by the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance show average increases of 10% to 19% for 2026.
“For a business with seven or eight employees, it is like buying a suit off the rack,” Jones said. “They don’t have any negotiating power.”
For almost 40 years, the cost of health insurance has been No. 1 among the “10 most severe problems for small business owners” identified by the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Conducted every four years, the Small Business Problems and Priorities survey ranks 75 issues facing businesses with fewer than 100 employees. The cost of health insurance was cited as an issue by 41% of employers, more than 20 percentage points higher than the second problem on the list, the cost of inventory and supplies.
In 2000, the report shows, almost half of all small businesses offered health insurance, with an average annual cost of about $2,600 per employee. Now, with the average cost greater than $8,000 per employee, fewer than one in three small employers provide coverage.
“When premiums go up, there are hard decisions that have to be made,” Jones said. “Deductibles go up to keep costs down. There are a number of things businesses try to do and not drop it all together.”
The smallest businesses may not survive if owners decide to seek employment that provides health coverage, said Marie Murphree, executive director of the Kirksville Area Chamber of Commerce.
“We might start seeing some of those go away,” said Murphree, who estimated that a fifth of the about 300 businesses in her chamber are individual entrepreneurs.
Higher premiums could be especially damaging in rural areas, Murphree said, where “we already see businesses who struggle to recruit people.” 
“Now one of the recruitment tools that you have,” she said, “you really can no longer offer, because it’s out of your ability to afford it.”
Rob Gilligan, president of the Cape Girardeau Area Chamber of Commerce, said the “vast majority” of the chamber’s 800 members have 50 employees or less. While he said they’d like to offer insurance to employees, the cost can be “prohibitive” with fewer staff to share costs.
The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry offers an insurance plan to businesses with fewer than 50 employees allowing them to pool together to share risk and ideally get more competitive rates.
Gilligan said that while some small business owners have expressed that they will be looking at higher deductible plans in anticipation of much higher premiums this year, they’ve already had to adapt to rising insurance costs in recent years.
“You just know that the cost of health is one of those things that’s going to continue to rise,” said Gilligan, whose chamber offers insurance to its employees. “We just have to kind of know that every year we’re going to look at that as something that we need to plan for and adapt to.”
 Farm Bureau alternative

The Affordable Care Act mandates that every plan offered by an employer and every plan on the health care marketplace provide minimum essential coverage. The 10 essential benefits range from hospitalization and office visits to maternity care, mental health treatments and preventive tests.
This year, legislators passed a law allowing the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer coverage that does not include all 10 benefits. 
Many farmers and other members of the Farm Bureau, proponents said, are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy an individual plan on the marketplace or make too much money to qualify for subsidies.
Members will be able to start buying plans on Jan. 2, with coverage set to begin Feb. 1, said Garrett Hawkins, president of the Farm Bureau. The website will be available starting Dec. 1, he said.
Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel

That will leave only about 15 days remaining in the open enrollment period for prospective purchasers to decide if they will sign up with the Farm Bureau, buy a marketplace plan or go without coverage.
Because prospective purchasers will choose from a menu of services, the price for each plan must be individually quoted, Hawkins said.
“We’re working feverishly to get the plan up and running,” Hawkins said, “but we’re just not quite there yet.” 
The Farm Bureau is a nonprofit agricultural membership organization which partners with for-profit companies to sell various kinds of insurance to its members. 
To buy Farm Bureau health coverage, a person has to be a member for 30 days. Anyone can join — the fee is $30 per year.
So far, Hawkins said, the new coverage does not seem to be driving an increase in membership. There are several hundred members who have indicated they are interested in getting a quote, he said.
Once the plan starts accepting applications, Hawkins said, there will be no “open enrollment” period. The coverage will be available for purchase at any time.
Hawkins has big ambitions for the coverage. Affordable health coverage can mean more people will stay in farming and pass their land on to a new generation.
“My goal is that this helps bring young people home to the farm,” Hawkins said. “My hope is it will allow a spouse to return home to the farm who is working off the farm solely to get benefits for the family.”
 A tough choice

Ross-Fisher said the insurance plan she purchased on the federal marketplace established by the 2010 Affordable Care Act was a “godsend” during her cancer treatment. 
And when her business suffered during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the enhanced premium tax credits passed by Congress in 2021 had kept insurance coverage within reach for her and her husband and allowed her to keep working for herself.
With those tax credits set to expire, Ross-Fisher is again considering giving up her business for a job with benefits.
Most people turning 65 are eligible for Medicare, which has its own premiums for the various coverages offered. For Ross-Fisher, the nearness of her 65th birthday in 2026 makes it tempting to drop coverage.
And before her cancer, she said, she would have chanced those six months. 
Now she’s leaning toward seeking full-time work.
“That would mean the end of my consulting business, which I dearly love,” she wrote in an email, “but under the circumstances I think it would be the most financially prudent thing to do.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettyimages-2211388790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 06:57:51.006408

Activists fear immigrant workers are sitting targets there. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Advocates say they worry immigration agents are targeting undocumented immigrants working at New Jersey warehouses that store imported goods.
Called bonded warehouses, these facilities are either owned or leased by the government or privately owned locations where companies can house imported goods for up to five years without paying duties. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for cargo security, can inspect them at any time.
As the Trump administration has ramped up its efforts to detain and deport millions of undocumented residents, immigrant advocates say customs and border agents have teamed up with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to round up warehouse workers because ICE agents can enter them without showing warrants.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials “hold the door open for ICE, and all of a sudden, people are taken away from their job sites,” said Li Adorno, an activist with Movimiento Cosecha, an organization that responds to immigration raids.
This happened most recently on Oct. 29. That was when ICE agents descended on the Savino Del Bene warehouse, a shipping and logistics facility in Avenel. Workers there were already on edge after signs were posted a few days prior describing the facility as a bonded warehouse.

“Warning,” one sign read in all caps. “Under the Customs and Border Protection laws of the United States, this bonded facility is under the custody and control of Customs and Border Protection.”
No other information was shared with workers, and many don’t speak English fluently. Federal officials said they arrested 46 workers, and advocates said the detainees were transported to detention centers in Elizabeth and Newark.
“Folks are going into work thinking that, ‘I’m going to come home.’ Especially if they’re temp workers, they’re being assigned to a workplace, so this sign popped up a few days before, and workers were unaware,” said Viri Martinez of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, who arrived at the warehouse shortly after the raid started.
The arrests carried out by ICE marked the state’s third known enforcement operation at a bonded warehouse. Another 13 workers were detained at a raid in Edison on Aug. 20 at the Smart Supply Chain warehouse, and 15 people were detained on July 8 at Alba Wine and Spirits in Edison.
Immigrant advocates fear that many of the workers at these warehouses don’t know they are taking jobs at facilities that are controlled in part by federal agents. Some of the employees are temporary workers assigned to the warehouses by staffing agencies.
The advocates say they have identified at least 600 bonded warehouses across the state, in port cities like Elizabeth, Newark, and Bayonne, and in towns like Cranbury and Edison.











People are taking whatever job is available if they have families to support ... I think economic survival overrides the fear


– Sally Pilly, First Friends board member



Roughly 475,000 undocumented immigrants are estimated to live in New Jersey. And 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Immigration raids at bonded warehouses are not new. Under President Obama, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees customs and immigration agents, said joint operations between 2005 and 2008 led to the detention of more than 350 undocumented immigrants.
Sally Pilly, a board member of Kearny-based immigration advocacy group First Friends, said she believes federal agents are using their ability to make unannounced inspections of bonded warehouses to help ICE “fill their quota.” Now, she said, “families don’t even know where their loved ones went.”
At the August raid in Edison, Pilly said, workers said they were told customs agents were coming in for an inspection to verify compliance with employment regulations. But immigration agents came instead, Pilly said, adding that she believes the inspection announcement was a ploy to “round up people.”
“We are very, very concerned that ICE is abusing the bonded warehouse designations,” Pilly said.
Immigration arrests and detention have surged to an all-time high under President Donald Trump. In May, the Trump administration set a quota to arrest 3,000 people a day nationwide, which translates into more than 1 million annually. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security bragged that it held a record 65,000 migrants in custody, with arrests and deportations reaching a record pace.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.
After the Oct. 29 raid, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the action was part of “ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with customs and immigration regulations, safeguard the integrity of the supply chain, and verify that warehouse operators are adhering to all applicable security requirements.” 
Calls to the warehouses on Tuesday went unanswered.
Pilly thinks protections granted by the state temporary workers’ bill of rights could help here. That’s a law that requires staffing agencies that arrange employment for third-party companies to provide basic information to temporary workers ahead of their shifts.
While the law doesn’t require staffing agencies to inform workers if they’re being assigned to a private warehouse overseen by customs and border agents, activists allege workers don’t know which warehouses they’re assigned to until they show up that morning, and because of that, some workers don’t know they could be taking jobs where federal agents could be present.
“The big gap is that agencies are not providing the information to workers for the warehouses, and we’re trying to raise the awareness to people so they know,” said Adorno.
While some workers without documentation are unaware that working at a bonded warehouse could increase the chances that they get detained and deported, others know and take the risk because they need to care for their families, Pilly said. Undocumented immigrants are often fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries, she added.
“People are taking whatever job is available if they have families to support. Rent at home is high. They are sending money back home. So I think economic survival overrides the fear,” she said.

“There were a million choices, but none of them were about keeping the money,” says Nancy Braus, who just donated a seven-figure inheritance to a Brattleboro center offering temporary housing.

BRATTLEBORO — Activist Nancy Braus has protested nearly a half-century on area streets to tax the rich and feed the poor. But townspeople here still did a double take when they learned she was giving a local family shelter her recent inheritance of $1 million.
“It was a bit of a shock and really takes your breath away,” said Chloe Learey, executive director of the Winston Prouty Center for Child and Family Development that will use the money to host up to 10 households at a time.
It’s just one way Braus has defied expectations.

“I don’t believe in inherited wealth,” the 71-year-old said in an interview. “I always knew I wanted to learn how to take care of myself and take care of others. I live in a small house. I shop for clothes only when I need underwear. I have no interest in going on a Caribbean cruise. For me, there were a million choices, but none of them were about keeping the money.”
Braus rewinds to 1984, when she opened an alternative bookstore — Everyone’s Books — near a Brattleboro shop that was such a literary landmark, it boasted an appearance by artist Norman Rockwell and an autograph photo from poet Robert Frost.
Braus, countering with such titles as “Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants” and “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,” turned her store into a downtown anchor by the time she sold it and retired in 2023.
Most locals now recognize Braus for her protest signs and Substack posts. What they didn’t know until recently: She’s the daughter of the late Jay Braus, founder of a namesake Manhattan real estate firm before his death in 2014, and Jane Wolbarst Braus, his wife of 63 years.
As a matriarch, Jane was a “dynamo” in her own right, her obituary noted upon her death on Feb. 6 at age 99. Braus remembers her mother requesting separate checks at a diner, only to bequeath a family fortune to four children and charitable causes including Planned Parenthood and Doctors Without Borders.
Soon after, Braus spoke with her three daughters — one who’s a Brattleboro public school teacher — about the challenges faced by students without housing.
“They get mocked, they’re hungry and without clean clothes, they don’t come to class for whatever hardships the family is having,” she said.
Braus then reached out to the Winston Prouty Center, located at the old Austine School of the Deaf once attended by her youngest daughter. The current nonprofit had run a temporary shelter for families before its state contract expired this summer. The center still had space and staff. Braus had money.

“It felt like everything aligned,” she said. “It was a really perfect fit.”
The new shelter, which debuted this month in a renovated dormitory, offers private rooms for up to 10 families who share kitchens, bathrooms and common living areas.
“I got teary,” Learey recalled of Braus revealing her gift. “It’s amazing when somebody steps up to make a difference like this.”
The money will allow the shelter to operate for at least two years as its host center — situated on a 184-acre campus — aims to develop 300 units of affordable housing in a proposed “Village at Winston Prouty.” 
“The Village will be a model for how rural communities can address interconnected challenges — child care, housing and workforce stability — by bringing people and services together,” Learey said. “The family shelter is a critical first step, but it cannot be the last.”
Braus, for her part, has declined pomp or plaques, although she’s allowing herself to be identified.
“Anonymity is a lot easier, but I wanted people to be aware that activists can also be donors,” she said. “If people can look at this and say, ‘I don’t need to keep all this money that I’m being left,’ I’ll feel like it was worth it. Obviously, if you’re living in dire poverty, you’re going to keep it. But I’m hoping that other people will decide that maybe society could use the money more. There are so many who need so much.”

Eagleton U.S. Courthouse in St. Louis, home of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Missouri (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).ST. LOUIS — A federal judge promised Tuesday that he would decide whether or not to block a referendum on Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting map before petitions to force a vote are submitted.
The state is asking U.S. District Judge Zachary Bluestone, a recent Trump appointee, to declare the U.S. Constitution precludes any popular effort to overturn the new map that was muscled through by Republicans in a September special session. People Not Politicians, a political action committee that has until Dec. 11 to submit enough signatures to force a vote on the map, wants Bluestone to dismiss the case and leave it to state courts to sort out.
Told in court that the signatures would be turned in Dec. 9, Bluestone said he would have a decision by that date.
Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. It is part of a national battle over drawing new lines begun when President Donald Trump pushed Texas to redistrict to win five new GOP seats in the narrowly divided Congress.
The case is one of eight — two in federal court and six in state court — that wrap the redistricting plan in multiple layers of litigation. One, argued Nov. 12 in Cole County and challenging the constitutionality of redistricting when there is no new census data, is awaiting a decision from Circuit Judge Christopher LImbaugh.
The latest lawsuit was filed Nov. 11 by Advanced Micro Targeting, the company gathering signatures for People Not Politicians, accusing competitors of “poaching” employees and “gathering intelligence” on its operations.
In the case before Bluestone, the state argues the federal constitution directs state legislatures to determine the boundaries of congressional districts. And without a clear statement in the Missouri Constitution’s referendum clause allowing votes on redistricting  plans, it is prohibited.
Lou Capozzi, state solicitor general, told Bluestone that he should intervene because the people are trying to infringe on the prerogatives of the General Assembly and it is costing the state money and employee time to process the referendum.
“From start to finish, the defendants’ actions impose significant burdens,” he said.
Jessica Amunson, representing People Not Politicians, said the costs are just employees in three state offices — secretary of state, attorney general and state auditor — doing their jobs. And future costs, for verifying signatures and an election, are speculative because the petitions have not been submitted yet.
The case, she said, is unprecedented. The plaintiffs — the General Assembly and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins — “are suing their own citizens to prevent them from petitioning their government.”
There are very few court precedents on the question of whether citizen referendum power extends to congressional district maps. Missouri voters rejected a redistricting plan in a 1922 referendum but that vote produced no guiding legal cases.
The attorneys did argue over the meaning of a 1916 U.S. Supreme Court decision in an Ohio case that found a referendum on a redistricting plan was a constitutional use of the power. 
Capozzi said the courts found the Ohio Constitution had a “clear statement” granting the power. 
Amunson disagreed. The Ohio referendum power is essentially the same as Missouri, allowing “any law” to be subject to a vote while Missouri says “any act” passed by lawmakers can be sent to a vote.
“In none of those cases was there a clear statement rule required,” she said.
Bluestone seemed more skeptical of Amunson’s arguments at times than Capozzi, but directed pointed questioning to both.
While he promised a decision by Dec. 9, at the beginning of the hearing he said the decision may be to hold the case without acting while other lawsuits play out in state court. 
In state court, Missouri is defending the redistricting plan by arguing the inverse of the argument in federal court —  the absence of words granting or barring lawmakers authority to revise district lines between census reports means it is allowed. Before Bluestone, the state is arguing that the absence of words granting or barring petitioners from seeking a referendum means it is not allowed. 
Richard von Glahn, executive director of People Not Politicians, said after the hearing that he’s not surprised by the apparent contradiction.
“What I saw in the hearing was, frankly, clarity from the state about how afraid they are of voters getting the final say on this,” von Glahn said. “If you think what you did is a good thing, you have nothing to fear from a referendum.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fedeal-courthouse-STL-1024x632.png,,,2025-11-26 06:57:51.006408

(Photo by Wagner Meier/Getty Images)I had the privilege of representing Minnesota at the recent United Nations Climate Conference of Parties. I’ve been attending these summits alongside Minnesota’s educators, elected officials and business leaders for the past 10 years. It is as important as ever that states like Minnesota step up and play a vital role in advancing the goals of global climate action.
Over 50,000 people from 193 nations gathered at the mouth of the Amazon in Belém, Brazil, for a two-week summit to spur further action to limit the planet’s warming and protect vulnerable people and places. Indigenous peoples were present in overwhelming numbers at this COP, with banners that read “Not about us without us” — demanding inclusion in decision making. 
For the first time in the 30-year history of COP climate summits, the U.S. did not send a single federal government official to the talks. The other missing nations were Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino. Even North Korea sent a delegation to Brazil. 
As the U.S. has shirked away from international cooperation, China has stepped into its vacuum, sending nearly 800 delegates to Brazil. From plenary sessions to back corridors, I heard praise upon praise for how Chinese industrial policies have brought down the costs of solar panels and electric vehicles for all.
While the federal government’s presence was lacking, the U.S. was not entirely absent from COP30. A coalition of 100 local leaders, governors and one sole member of Congress — U.S. Sen.Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. — delivered a singular message: Our cities and states are working to be reliable and stable partners in the fight for climate action. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom stole the stage at COP30, moving from venue to venue declaring his climate ambitions. Taking the torch of international cooperation from the federal government, Newsom went on to sign technology agreements with Brazil, Columbia and Nigeria.
Newsom’s leadership should resonate with Minnesotans and our elected officials. As Fresh Energy has calculated, if the Midwest were its own country, we would rank as the fifth-largest emitter globally. Compared with other U.S. regions, our transportation, agricultural and electricity generation systems disproportionately rely on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. 
But Minnesota is also the exception of the region. We lead the Midwest with our 100% clean electricity by 2040 law, and other states in our region are following our example.   
Given this, I was disappointed that Gov. Tim Walz and members of his administration did not attend COP30 and spread our successes. Minnesota often has one of the largest delegations — representing the private, public and nonprofit sectors —  at these climate summits. There were over 60 of us from Minnesota in Scotland for COP26. This year would have been a golden opportunity to showcase our progressive policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions, particularly our unique critical minerals reserves and our metals recycling industries. 
While COP30 did not achieve wide consensus on the phasing out of fossil fuels, it did result in some important milestones, including the first references in the draft action plan to the social and environmental risks associated with mining critical minerals. More than half of the minerals needed for the global energy transition are located on or near Indigenous lands. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems.”

While this initiative was supported by dozens of countries, it was ultimately left out of the final declaration in large part due to opposition from China. Nonetheless, this COP showed us mineral diplomacy will be a key part of climate diplomacy in the future. The material realities of the clean energy transition — including the need to sustainably source lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper — can no longer be ignored.
Minnesota can be a global example of responsible mineral production that prioritizes Indigenous peoples’ participation. We can also be at the forefront of developing a circular economy for energy transition minerals so that we can protect our treasured places. 
At COP30, the International Energy Agency highlighted evidence that the market value of critical minerals recycling could reach $200 billion by 2050. In 2024, the Minnesota Legislature created a Critical Materials Recovery Task Force to advise policymakers on how to increase the recovery of critical materials — including aluminum, cobalt, copper, nickel and silicon — from end-of-life products. These are the kinds of initiatives that can help Minnesota lead on the global climate stage.
I came home from Brazil with a renewed commitment to fighting climate change here at home. This work starts by channeling the leadership of other nations, and key U.S. states, to move forward on emissions reductions while pursuing economic opportunities. 
Charting a path on responsible mineral production in Minnesota could demonstrate to the world how we can meet our global challenges with integrity.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray is in the midst of the greatest political maelstrom of his seven-plus years as the chamber’s leader, facing President Donald Trump’s ire over congressional redistricting.
A deeply divided Senate voted last week to scrap planned December meetings to consider redrawing Indiana’s current U.S. House map — under which Republicans have a 7-2 majority — to improve the GOP’s chances of capturing all nine seats. Bray maintains that too few Republican senators support redistricting for it to clear the Senate.
Things to know about Bray:
As Senate president pro tempore, he is leader of the Senate’s majority party (which has been the Republicans since 1979). Bray presides over Senate sessions when the chamber’s president, Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, is absent. But Bray’s true Statehouse power comes from his authority to pick committee chairs, direct bills to particular committees and broadly set the Senate’s agenda.
Republican senators chose Bray as president pro tem in 2018 following David Long’s decision to step down after 12 years in the office. Bray’s been officially elected by the full Senate to the position each two years since then, with Democrats, by practice, not opposing the Republicans’ pick.
Bray was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and rose quickly within its ranks. Long bypassed many more-senior senators to pick Bray for the No. 2 position of majority floor leader in 2017. That set the stage for his jump into the president pro tem post the following year.
The 56-year-old Bray’s typical calm demeanor obscures his resolve, a former Senate colleague says. “Rod has a quiet confidence about him,” said Jim Merritt, an Indianapolis Republican who served 30 years in the Senate until resigning in 2020. “When he became pro tem, I think a lot of people thought that he was too nice. I think they judged it wrong. I think when people step out of line, if you will, he has quietly disciplined, I’m not going to say punish, but disciplined them.”
Bray is from Martinsville, graduating from Martinsville High School and Indiana University before receiving a law degree from Valparaiso University. An Indiana attorney since 1994, he joined his now-retired father’s law firm before running for office and maintains a Martinsville law practice. He is married with two sons.

Politics is the family business. Bray succeeded his father, Richard Bray, in the Senate seat. The elder Bray served 18 years in the Indiana House, followed by two decades in the Senate. Rodric Bray’s grandfather, William Bray, served 24 years in the U.S. House before losing a reelection race in 1974.
The impact of the redistricting fight on the Legislature colors Bray’s decision making. “I have a deep and abiding regard for this institution and our democratic process, and that’s a result of my grandfather, my father and my family,” Bray told reporters last week. “I always want to treat it with the utmost respect, which is what I’m trying to do here.”
Why not just hold a Senate vote on redistricting? “When there’s an issue, if we know we don’t have the votes for it, we don’t typically come in (for a vote),” Bray said. “This, I recognize, is a little bit of a different issue. It’s got a little more attention than some of our even more public bills. But that is typically how we handle that when we don’t have the votes to pass it.”
Bray represents a heavily Republican district in central Indiana that includes all of Morgan County, where Martinsville is the county seat, and parts of Johnson, Greene and Putnam counties. 
Bray won reelection last year to a term running until November 2028. That puts Trump’s threat to support a Republican primary challenger to Bray on hold for a while. Bray faced an active 2024 primary opponent but won with 63% of the vote.
He’s held off a previous challenge to his Senate leadership. That happened in 2022 when Bray removed then-Sen. Mark Messmer of Jasper from the majority floor leader position after disagreements over handling of the near-total abortion ban bill. Bray defeated Messmer a few months later in a vote among Senate Republicans to remain their top leader. Messmer left the Senate last year for his successful race for a U.S. House seat.
On dealing with Trump about redistricting (and arguing that Republicans should, instead, focus on trying to defeat Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan in northwestern Indiana’s current 1st District): “I’ve had a couple conversations with the president. Honored to talk to the president, frankly. I know that he’s passionate about this issue. I’ve explained to him … that we want to be helpful. We want to see a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, and this is the best way forward, as we see it.”

The Idaho Department of Labor on Friday released the full 2025 Profile of Rural Idaho, a comprehensive report examining population growth, migration, industry shifts, and other characteristics of Idaho’s rural counties. 
The report shows that, while the Gem State has retained the same ratio of rural-to-urban counties over the years, the demographics, economics, crime and opportunities have all changed dramatically. 
Thirty-five of Idaho’s 44 counties are considered rural — defined in the report as a county that does not have a city with at least 20,000 residents. 
However, amid booming population increases to the state over the past several years, just 28% of Idaho’s residents lived in rural counties in 2023, down from 36% in 1990. 
The report was the culmination of a yearlong process by state labor economists, Idaho Department of Labor Director Jani Revier said during a webinar held Tuesday. The first and second installments of the three-part report were released in May and July respectively. 
 Education, child care and internet drive barriers to employment in rural Idaho

The third section of the 98-page report emphasized “critical trends” in rural Idaho, including evaluating employment challenges, education, aging demographics, and transportation and broadband access. 
Between 2022 and 2024, Idaho overall had record-setting low unemployment rates. However, over the past few decades, Idaho’s overall labor force participation has been declining. The number of people working or actively seeking work as a share of the working age population peaked in Idaho in 1998 at over 70%, the report said. In 2024, it was 64%. 
In the last five years of labor participation data, the 20 Idaho counties that had labor force participation rates below 60% were classified as rural. The state’s nine urban counties had a labor participation rate of 64.1%. 
The report points to a combination of an aging population, lack of child care, and lower education rates as potential factors leading to lower labor force participation. 
Between 2019 and 2023, 11.6% of adults aged 25 and older in rural counties did not finish high school, as opposed to 7.1% of those in urban counties. This is an improvement from 2009 to 2013, when nearly 15% of adults in that age group in rural Idaho counties did not get a high school diploma. 
“Continued focus on targeted workforce education programs within rural areas, such as in-school career technical education programs, registered apprenticeships and Idaho LAUNCH, may provide the greatest training benefit to rural areas with high workforce needs that are not within close proximity of a public postsecondary institution,” the report said. 
Idaho Launch refers to a program spearheaded by Gov. Brad Little which provides grants to graduating Idaho high school seniors to use for tuition, job training or an apprenticeship program for in-demand careers.
Rural counties also had much lower ratios of child care employees to children under the age of 5. The report also highlighted that the number of counties where at least 20% of households who don’t have a broadband internet subscription is much higher in rural areas. 
 People in Idaho’s rural counties are aging, including farmers, leaving the future of agriculture in question 

Idaho, following national trends, is facing an aging population as birthrates decline and the baby boomer generation gets older. 
“As birth rates look poised to continue falling and a higher share of the resident population hits retirement age, this is likely to result in a chronic labor supply shortage for many of Idaho’s counties — most drastically in the rural areas,” the report said.
What are called “open country counties,” defined as those with no urban area of at least 7,500 people and no strong commuting ties to a metro area, have the lowest birthrate in Idaho, at 11 births per 1,000 residents. These open country counties have the highest median resident age, at over 44 years old. 
Of the 20 top counties with the highest median age, the majority of them also had labor participation rates below 60%. 
Idaho’s share of agriculture producers aged 65 and older has increased 123% since 2002, the report said. 
The price of agricultural land has also skyrocketed in that time, while revenues have lagged. 
(From the 2025 Rural profile of Idaho)
The number of farms in rural Idaho has decreased 9.8% between 2002 and 2022, the report said, while the price per acre of land increased 151%. These two factors could mean an uncertain future for much of Idaho’s agricultural land. 
“As farm acre prices continue to rise while cost inputs remain elevated,” the report said, “these decisions may tip in favor of farmland being sold and transitioning to other competing uses for a higher monetary return, such as residential or commercial land development.”

 Poverty rates had declined across Idaho, but many rural families struggle to afford cost of living 

Idaho’s poverty rates declined significantly from 2019 to 2023, the report said, but rural counties experienced a more “subdued drop.” 
The poverty rate between 2019 to 2023, compared to the five years prior, dropped 5% in Idaho’s urban counties and 4.1% in rural counties. 
The urban counties still had the highest poverty rates, at 12.7%. The open country counties had the second highest at 12.6%. 
Rural counties saw a slight increase in the poverty rate of residents 65 and older from 9% in 2013 to 9.9% in 2023. 
(From the 2025 Rural Profile of Idaho)
The report also looked at incomes versus cost of basic necessities, like housing, food and transportation. Rural counties had lower expenses for housing and child care, but less access to grocery stores and had longer commutes, the report found. Rural families also tend to have more children than urban families, the report said, “further highlighting the living wage challenge of raising a family in rural Idaho.” 
“While the cost of living is cheaper in rural counties, only 31% of rural households earn incomes high enough to support a family of four, compared with 49% of urban households,” the report said.
 Most crime dramatically decreased in rural Idaho, except drug offenses 

Across Idaho, property and violent crimes have reduced dramatically over the past 20 years. 
Between 2003 and 2023, property crime reduced 72% in rural counties and 55% in urban areas. Violent crime overall dropped 18% in rural areas and 11% in urban counties at that time. 
(From the 2025 Rural Profile of Idaho)
“The cause of this decrease can be partially attributed to the long-term downward unemployment trend,” the report said. “… As more people are able to earn employment income through legitimate means, there may be less incentive to engage in criminal acts which carry a high risk of penalties like incarceration.” 
Drug offenses have increased in both urban and rural areas. 
In rural counties, drug offenses increased 44% between 2003 and 2023, and were up 26% in urban areas. 
Open country counties had the highest drug offense rate of any county type, at 693 per 100,000 residents. 
 Broadband improvements and renewable energy present economic opportunities for rural areas

Access to broadband internet has been highlighted as a “critical labor force trend,” since the 2005 Profile of Rural Idaho, the report said, “that need has only intensified since.” 
“High speed broadband creates opportunities for the highly skilled rural labor force to train or work remotely with less reliance on an employer’s specific location,” the report said.
Between 2019 and 2012, 24 rural and three urban counties had at least 20% of households without internet subscriptions. 
The most up-to-date benchmark set by the Federal Communications Commission for high-speed internet was 100 megabits per second, the report said, and 28 rural Idaho counties are unable to meet those benchmarks with existing infrastructure.  
The report also identified renewable energy projects, amid growing electricity demands, as an area of potential growth in Idaho. 
Idaho produces around 20% of its own energy needs, the report said, and 60% of its annual energy consumption. Idaho contains no significant sources of coal or oil. 
“Renewable energy production and transmission is likely to be another stronghold industry in rural Idaho going forward,” the report said. “Modern technology adoption, such as a higher penetration of electric vehicles, construction of large regional data centers, and continued implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) will be highly dependent on rural Idaho for electricity generation.”

(Courtesy photo)Vivacious and full of life, Dylan Cheatwood was a thrill-seeker with a big heart who enjoyed motorcycles, surfing and riding bulls.
Perhaps it was because he was diagnosed with epilepsy at a young age, but Dylan was determined not to let his illness rob him of anything. He not only embraced life’s experiences but tried everything to curb his unrelenting seizures: a combination of countless medicines, a vagus nerve stimulator implanted in his chest and even a brain surgery that proved unsuccessful.
At just 25, Dylan died unexpectedly of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is identified as a cause of death when an individual with epilepsy dies unexpectedly and in the absence of a seizure. His loss revealed a devastating truth about the lack of epilepsy awareness and care in Oklahoma, a reality shared by more than 41,000 individuals across the state.
SUDEP is a leading cause of death among the 2.9 million Americans living with epilepsy. In Dylan’s case, the seizures began when he was very young, at just two years old: he experienced movement seizures along with day- and nighttime seizures, and unfortunately, he was never able to achieve seizure control.
Despite Dylan having every risk factor, we were never informed of the risks or treatments that could help reduce the likelihood of SUDEP. Risk factors include early-onset epilepsy, tonic-clonic and nighttime seizures, and the inability to achieve seizure control even with medications, surgeries or implanted devices.
While everyone’s epilepsy is different, SUDEP risk may be reduced by achieving seizure control, night monitoring (through devices, co-sleeping or even an epilepsy service dog), avoiding alcohol and stimulants, and talking with a doctor about options like the ketogenic diet. However, patients can’t take steps to prevent something they’ve never been told about. That’s why better reporting — and awareness — is vital.
Passed earlier this year, House Bill 2013, known as Dylan’s Law, represents a major step forward for individuals and families living with epilepsy in Oklahoma.
The law, which went into effect Nov. 1, creates awareness around SUDEP among first responders by providing an option for individuals living with epilepsy to include a special designation on their drivers’ license, an identifier that could lead to faster treatment in an emergency.
Dylan’s Law also directs the State Commissioner of Health to make training about SUDEP available to physicians among continuing medical education credits — a move that will enhance awareness about SUDEP among physicians in the hopes that doctors will be better equipped to share that information with individuals and families living with epilepsy.
The bill also encourages SUDEP investigation in autopsies, effectively creating the nation’s most comprehensive epilepsy legislation. This is important, because while it’s estimated that we lose 1,000 Oklahomans each year to SUDEP, true figures aren’t known due to poor data tracking, a lack of education by health professionals and public stigma that prevents patients with seizures from seeking treatment. Too many people suffer in silence, and too many families are left without answers.
Dylan’s bravery in the face of epilepsy was an inspiration, and as his friends and family, we couldn’t let his death be in vain. In the years since his passing, we have turned grief into action by advocating for greater epilepsy and SUDEP awareness and working with lawmakers to craft legislation designed to better support individuals suffering from recurrent seizures.
In honoring Dylan’s life, we hope that no other family has to suffer a loss like we did and that Oklahoma now has systems in place to support those living with epilepsy. Dylan’s Law ensures his story will not be forgotten and that his legacy will make a difference for thousands of Oklahomans.

Though worker advocates cheer more affordable premiums, some scoff at ""safe workplaces"" claims and say the state is too stingy with its $2.8 billion fund when it comes to helping injured workers.
The post Wyoming employers get a break on workers’ comp premiums for third straight year appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming employers participating in the state’s workers’ compensation program will experience a 15% break in premiums next year, the third rate reduction in as many years. 
That will result in a combined annual savings of $66 million, according to the Department of Workforce Services. Employers in good standing, and with three or more years in the program, may enjoy even bigger savings.
“By lowering workers’ compensation costs, we are helping employers invest in their workforce, strengthen their operations and continue to build safe, resilient workplaces across our state,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement announcing the rate reduction.
All employers of businesses in Wyoming classified as “extra hazardous” are required to participate in the state’s workers’ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Workforce Services. Others may voluntarily enroll, which typically entitles them to legal immunity for workplace injuries. The program is funded by premiums paid by employers to cover lost wages and medical bills for their employees who are injured on the job.
Wyoming is one of the few states that does not offer workers’ compensation benefits to undocumented workers.
$2.8 billion fund
The state can afford to offer lower premiums, Workforce Services Director Elizabeth Gagen suggested, because “Wyoming’s strong safety culture and responsible business practices are paying off, creating lasting benefits for both our workforce and our economy.”

A September report to the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee indicates the workers’ compensation fund is growing at a rate that surpasses expenditures and liabilities.
“The average annual rate of return on the [workers’ compensation] investment portfolio over the past five years is approximately 6.8%,” Workforce Services Deputy Director Jason Wolfe told WyoFile via email. “Coupled with year-over-year declines in the number of injuries, as shown in the report, and sound cost containment and case management strategies, this means we’re typically spending a bit less than we’re making.”
The state’s workers’ compensation fund has risen steadily from $1.8 billion in 2015 to more than $2.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2025, according to the state’s report. During the same period, annual claim expenditures have grown from $178 million to nearly $194 million.
Critics dispute safety claims
Worker advocates question assertions that expenditures remain moderate due to safe workplaces and a decline in work-related injuries. They say not all injuries are reported, while pointing to Wyoming’s chronic worst- or among-the-worst workplace fatality rates in the nation.

Yes, Wyoming’s workers’ compensation program works well when it comes to acute injuries with an easily defined recovery prognosis, some say. But the state tends to fight against expensive and prolonged claims related to things like back injuries, chronic pain and illnesses.
Any notion that Wyoming’s flush workers’ compensation fund is due to a strong workplace safety track record is “bullshit,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said.
“I mean, we may have [fewer] claims,” Kindred told WyoFile, “but we still kill more people than any other state.” And she suggested that the state’s moderate workers’ compensation expenses might derive from Wyoming’s bootstraps mentality, which discourages injured workers from making a claim or fighting a challenge to a claim.
“I’m just picturing my guys having to, again and again, go to hearings and court cases in front of anybody in power and say, ‘I need help,'” Kindred continued. “It’s insurmountable, and it’s hard to get people to admit they need help.”
Asked to respond to such criticism, Wolfe, of workforce services, said, “The evidence actually shows our denial rate of claims to be fairly steady, with a slight decline over the last five years. The denial rate is approximately 5%-6% of annual claims.”
“Because the state is not a for-profit insurance company, it is perfectly appropriate to make sure that Wyoming businesses are paying a fair amount,” Lawyers and Advocates for Wyoming Director Mark Aronowitz told WyoFile. 
“At the same time,” Aronowitz continued, “I believe that ‘sound cost containment and case management strategies’ should include a detailed analysis of all workplace fatalities and serious injuries in order to prevent similar incidents from ever occurring again.”
That type of deliberate, all-inclusive analysis is not happening in Wyoming, according to worker advocates. 
“Resources wisely spent on injury prevention could help save the fund, and employers, millions of dollars over time,” Aronowitz added, “while, more importantly, reducing our perennially unacceptably high workplace fatality rate.”

A recently passed resolution to limit free speech demonstrates how little the state Republican Party believes in the First Amendment, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Charlie Kirk and the hypocrisy of the Wyoming GOP appeared first on WyoFile .","Among the many freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, there is one freedom that is conspicuously absent. Nothing therein guarantees your freedom to not be annoyed, shocked, scared shitless or offended by what someone else says.

Opinion

Pluralism, as we Americans enjoy, almost guarantees that someone WILL be offended by something that someone else says. I’m here to testify that is a good thing. It guarantees that we will not become a nation of frightened intellectual pantywaists.
Censorship in favor of anyone’s tender feelings indicates a lack of faith in our freedom of speech, our collective mental resiliency and in our basic American liberty. I wish the Wyoming Republican Party would realize that.
A hadith is a fundamental precept of the Islamic faith, but one that does not necessarily issue from the Quran. A hadith is a sort of apocryphal truism that has found its way into the Muslim canon by repetition. An example would be the Islamic law that nobody can make an image or draw a picture of the Prophet. Such an act is considered offensive to the faith, and can and has resulted in the artist’s death.
When the Wyoming Republican Party recently passed a resolution to investigate, condemn and punish people who cheered or spoke inappropriately when Charlie Kirk was killed, they created a new hadith that is blasphemous to our constitutional canon. And they demonstrated publicly how little they believe in our First Amendment freedoms.
Apparently, the nasty rhetoric spouted by Kirk’s opponents after he was killed shocked and appalled the Wyoming GOP, and they determined that they had to put a stop to it. But they forgot that the First Amendment to our Constitution contains no penalty for shocking or appalling speech. Nor does it place conditions on speech or mention consequences for speaking freely. It just says that, in our country, speech is free.
In passing the aforementioned resolution, the Wyoming GOP also ignored the “Timeless Truth” in Plank 22 of its own platform, which states, “Freedom of speech includes the freedom of the individual to express his or her beliefs, ideas and opinions without fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanction by government.”
The Wyoming GOP’s resolution says that those who celebrate and condone political murder, such as the murder of Charlie Kirk, should be investigated and punished. Yet, just a few days ago, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump. This is the same Saudi crown prince who ordered the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post reporter whom the Saudi royal considered an enemy.

When a reporter at the meeting asked Trump about the murder, he shrugged and said, “Things happen.”
Will the Wyoming GOP investigate and punish Trump for condoning political murder? Don’t hold your breath.
For a once-proud political organization like the Wyoming Republican Party to dishonor itself by passing a resolution that is clearly contrary to our Constitution, as well as to its own platform, causes us to ask why such forked-tongued hypocrisy occurred. I have a couple of thoughts.
I smell the influence of the Freedom Caucus on this one. This looks like a continuation of their Sharia-esque power grab in the Cowboy State, and their my-way-or-the-highway attitude toward anyone who doesn’t buy into their bullshit.
This resolution also suggests that power has gone to the Wyoming GOP’s head, and their hubris is showing. For a political party to try to supplant the Constitution through its own internal pronouncements appears just a tad bit despotic.
The First Amendment says what it says, and means what it means, and there’s not a thing the Wyoming GOP can do about that, no matter how many hadiths they write to the contrary.
They’ll probably consider this column some sort of unpatriotic hate speech directed toward a tender spot in their insecure self-identity, and call for me and anyone else who points out their hypocrisy to be investigated and punished. Screw ‘em!

(David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)Four members of the West Virginia Legislature signed onto a national bipartisan letter this week opposing a policy under consideration by Congress that would allow the federal government to preempt state regulations on artificial intelligence.
The letter was signed by 280 state lawmakers from across the country, including West Virginia’s own Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, and Dels. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha; Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson and Margitta Mazzocchi, R-Logan. 
In the letter, lawmakers expressed their “strong opposition” to any federal policy that would prohibit states from implementing and enforcing their own regulations on AI. They also shared concerns over how federal preemptive measures on the technology could undo and undermine laws already in place.
“As state lawmakers and policymakers, we hear regularly from constituents about rising online harms and the growing influence of AI on their lives,” the letter reads. “… In the years ahead, AI’s impact will require lawmakers to consider consequential public policy questions, making it essential that states retain the authority to act.”
The opposition to federal preemption over AI comes after a similar provision to stop state regulation was pulled out of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to bipartisan opposition earlier this year. That provision would have implemented a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI regulations.
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson
“I was one of the people that wrote in protest of the provision that would have preempted AI regulation in the Big Beautiful Bill, so when I saw that they’re attempting to do it again, obviously I still feel the same way. Not much has changed here in the past few months,” Rucker said. “I still feel that it is not acceptable that the federal government is trying to co-opt state’s rights when it comes to this, and no, I am not okay with that.”
After its failure in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, national news outlets reported last week that the Trump administration was considering an executive order to ban state regulation on AI. On Nov. 21, Reuters reported that the executive order effort was being put on pause. 
Instead, according to Punchbowl News, the executive branch and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., want to see the same preemption provision included in the National Defense Authorization Act. That legislation sets the budget and policy priorities for the nation’s military and defense infrastructure over the upcoming fiscal year.
Currently, there is little to no oversight for AI nationwide. Some localities have already passed their own laws to regulate the technology and, in some cases, ban it from being used for certain purposes. They’ve also implemented certain penalties for individuals who use the technology to promote harmful deepfakes, misinformation and more.
Proponents for federal preemption over AI regulation have said they don’t want there to be a patchwork of different policies state-to-state regarding the technology. AI industry leaders — specifically companies that create the AI technology in question — support federal control over regulation as opposed to state control. They worry that state regulation could stifle innovation. Under the current administration, it’s likely that federal regulation would be more lax compared to the approach taken in some states. 
Rucker said she’s concerned over the AI industry — dominated by deep-pocketed tech companies and venture capitalist firms — benefitting from a lack of regulation that could ultimately harm regular citizens.
“I know that this push is, again, being pushed by big-money interests and that is very hard for the average American to fight,” Rucker said. “I worry that they’re trying to take advantage of the average citizen not really paying attention to [the National Defense Authorization Act].”
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Young said she holds similar concerns. She said it’s easy to boil an issue like this down to politics, but the concerns are much deeper than that and it’s clear that both President Donald Trump and his administration are betting big on AI development as well as political support from the industry’s leaders.
This week, the White House signed an executive order to “accelerate” the use of AI in scientific research. That followed numerous other executive orders meant to increase the use and dependence on AI in numerous sectors, including education, energy and more.
And Trump, as well as other political leaders, have grown closer to those who head AI companies and others that create the hardware they rely on to operate.
“I don’t want to be hyper-political, but Trump has all the billionaires in his pocket on this. This is why they [the federal government] want to regulate it,” Young said. “They want to be able to do whatever they want to do, and a lot of times they want to do it with state and federal dollars, but they don’t want any safety provisions. That’s a problem and it’s one we should be able to confront as elected lawmakers.”
Young and Rucker both said they were grateful that the fight against federal preemption continues to be so bipartisan. None of the concerns around the industry are partisan, Young said. Rucker said it “gives [her] hope” to see pushback come from both sides of the aisle in time of high political polarization.
“It shows that at the end of the day, people can really win if they put special interests aside, then if we just all focus on putting the people forward — which is our job to do as the government and what we’ve been elected to do as state [lawmakers],” Young said. “We’ve seen that happen and be successful in bipartisan ways. There’s bipartisan AI bills all over the country … that shows that we can just put the politics aside and put people first, but we need to have the right to do that.”

Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta underwent its annual winter transformation last week, with some workers hanging wreaths around the building’s numerous lampposts, and others attending to the monumental task of installing the Capitol Christmas tree.
The tree will eventually be decked out with over 35,000 lights, and ceremonially illuminated during the annual tree-lighting ceremony with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. But the process of installing the tree takes a coordinated effort from a number of Santa’s helpers — along with more than a few hardworking Georgians.
This year’s tree, which is sitting in the rotunda at the state Capitol, measures a whopping 26 feet tall. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
This year’s tree, which is sitting in the rotunda at the state Capitol, measures a whopping 26 feet tall. According to the Georgia Building Authority, it is an eastern red cedar that was donated by a resident of Lindale, which sits about 60 miles northwest of Atlanta. 
Taylor Willingham, a chief ranger at the Georgia Forestry Commission, has helped with the process of transporting the Capitol Christmas tree for the past several years. He said harvesting the tree is typically a three-hour process that begins early in the morning and requires the combined efforts of the Georgia Forestry Commission, the Georgia Building Authority and Georgia State Patrol. 
The process, he said, “is fairly intricate, because you definitely want to deliver a beautiful Christmas tree for everyone to see.”
Once the chosen tree is loaded onto a truck from the Georgia Forestry Commission, it begins the long journey to the heart of Atlanta, with members of the Georgia State Patrol leading the way and the Georgia Building Authority bringing up the rear. This part of the trip, Willingham said, can be precarious at times.
“You have to be extra careful with the tree so it doesn’t catch on signs or anything as you travel,” he said.
But it is also among the most memorable parts of each year’s sojourn to the Capitol, as Georgia residents get the chance to catch glimpses of the tree’s journey.
“You can see the excitement in people’s eyes,” Willingham said. “You can see how people just light up when they realize what’s going on.”
Workers use a crane to lift the tree inside the building, then stand it upright and secure it to the third floor balconies.
A tree lighting ceremony will be held in December, though the exact date has not yet been announced.
Chuck Berry, the owner of Berry’s Tree Farm and the president of the Georgia Christmas Tree Association, said a Georgia-grown red cedar is a natural choice for a place like the state Capitol.
“To me, the red cedar is a traditional Christmas tree,” he said. “It’s what most people, years ago, grew up with.”
However, he added, commercial Christmas tree farms tend to favor faster-growing cypress trees over cedars, so Georgia residents may be unlikely to find one at their nearest tree farm. 
For families who are shopping for a tree this year, the Georgia Department of Agriculture recently published a map of Georgia-grown Christmas trees that includes nearly 100 farms across the state. 
“The advantage of a Christmas tree farm is you actually get to know when [the tree] was cut, so there’s no question as to how fresh it is,” Berry said. “Most Christmas tree farms in the state now offer activities for families and children, so you’re not necessarily just getting a Christmas tree, you’re actually building memories.”

(Photo by Kirk Fisher/Getty Images)Those of us who love Priest Lake cannot help but notice the increased intensity of logging activity on the east side. 
Driving along the east side road, we encounter clear cuts down to the road. Streams such as Cougar Creek and Bear Creek have had extensive logging and road building throughout their watersheds. To explain the changes, I think it is useful to explore how the endowment lands came to be as well as their intended and current use.
With westward expansion after the American Revolution, Congress sought to regulate the acquisition of land in the old Northwest Territories (consisting of lands west of the Appalachians, north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi). Townships were established as 6×6 miles with 36 one by one mile (640 acres) sections. 
Thomas Jefferson felt that an educated electorate was necessary for the new democratic republic and designated section 16 of each township for the benefit of the public school. Prior to this, education was a privilege of the elite with most ordinary children having to work from the moment they could carry a hoe or churn the butter. Income from section 16 went into a fund to support the school. 
The system was workable because farmland in the old Northwest was and remains highly productive. With an increasing population, the land became much more valuable and was sold off. The proceeds went into a school endowment fund. And even today, profit from those state funds goes exclusively to public schools. 
With further expansion of the population westward the landscape changed considerably where there were many areas that were not economically productive. For instance, a section of land in Owyhee County might support one cow, a dozen jack rabbits and a few rattle snakes.  
Recognizing the geographic diversity in the West, the states were allowed to consolidate their section 16’s into contiguous areas. In Idaho, the most productive endowment lands are in the north. These lands do not belong to the state, but to the school endowment. 
They are governed by the Land Board, consisting of the five highest-ranking public officials and managed by the Idaho Department of Lands. Sale of lands, logging and lease arrangements provide money that goes into the endowment fund. The endowment lands, described by the Land Board as their “sacred trust,” are constitutionally mandated to maximize revenue for the benefit of the schools. Each year the Land Board decides how much money goes to public schools. 

 Managing Idaho’s forest lands

Prior to 2000, the Idaho Department of Lands managed the forest with the understanding that from the time to harvest to regeneration and re-harvest was 80 years. This was the standard of practice in the Northwest for the U.S. Forest Service as well as private companies such as Weyerhaeuser. 
In 2006, an industry sponsored nonprofit organization, Forest Biometric Research Institute, was established to study forest inventory, growth and management in Oregon. This organization views their forests as working forests. 
With the logging mills adapting to smaller diameter logs, the institute has determined that a crop rotation of 40-45 years is adequate. They have developed their own proprietary software to facilitate management toward this goal. 
Over time, timber companies all over the West have followed along in lock step. Just in the last few years, this includes the Idaho Department of Lands. What we see now rolling down Highway 57 are large logs that are clearing the senescent forest to make way for the tree farm. Ultimately, after this burst of intense logging of large trees, the steady state working forest will produce logs of 8-10 inches’ diameter. The tree farm will look very different from the forest we have known.
We have concerns. One is that the endowment lands cannot sustain a re-harvest interval of 45 years. Another is that the annual contribution to our public schools is a token amount. We also feel that the Land Board may not be living up its fiduciary responsibilities as trustees.
In the Northern Rockies ecological zone, the growing season is short and winters are long. Therefore, it takes a considerable number of years for a conifer to mature compared to the same species in the milder wetter climate of the Oregon Coast (home to Forest Biometric Research Institute).
 Our soils are young, only established since the last glaciation. The soils are nutrient poor, easily erodible and the terrain is mountainous with steep slopes in many locales. Given these conditions, a rapid crop rotation may deplete the soil of nutrients and abet soil erosion. 
For the last five seasons, the Selkirk Conservation Alliance has monitored the stream chemistries of 18 Priest Lake tributaries. Watersheds that have experienced limited human impact have very low levels of the nutrient phosphorus; however, Cougar Creek which flows into Cavanaugh Bay has consistently demonstrated high levels. We are certain that high levels of phosphorus can be used as a proxy for soil erosion. 
Examining the Cougar Creek watershed, there has been intensive road building and logging over the last 10 years. With GIS modeling, we can predict the intensity of soil loss in a drainage, and we are actively exploring the possibility of engaging a GIS expert to pursue this project. This will help determine the quantity of soil loss over time. Soil loss can occur quickly, but in our region the rebuilding of soil can take 30-100 years.
 Idaho schools face real funding needs

Thomas Jefferson envisioned that section 16 would fund public education. Maybe 200 years ago that was workable, but the population is ever increasing, education for kids is 13 years instead of eight and the amount of information needed to navigate a modern world is much greater. 
In the West Bonner County School District, the cost of educating one student is about $13,500 per year. The state contributes about $10,500, and it is expected that the district will come up with the balance. Unfortunately, the school district has had trouble with passing school bond levies such that last year the local Priest Lake Elementary School was threatened with closure. Fortunately, the last levy passed, although not by a large margin. 
It is not like our district is fiscally irresponsible. Our teachers are poorly paid. Of the 115 school districts in Idaho, our teachers’ salaries are fifth from the bottom. The infrastructure also is in bad shape. So you might expect that the endowment fund would provide a substantial amount of fiscal relief, but in reality, the fund provides each K-12 student in Idaho with a whopping $200 (2024).
The Idaho Land Board is the trustee for the endowment lands. As such, members must act as fiduciaries to invest wisely in order to maximize returns. And they must never erode the corpus of the trust which includes the endowment fund and the endowment lands. 
The current balance in the fund is $3.3 billion. Last year the board allocated around $100 million to various recipients to include $63 million to public schools, $3.6 million to Idaho State University, $12.8 million to the University of Idaho and a lesser amount to Lewis-Clark State College. Appropriately, these recipients are educational institutions, but money was also given to State Hospital South, the Capitol Commission, Veterans Home and to Juvenile Corrections. 
These latter recipients were no doubt worthy, but why should they receive funding from the endowment fund? This looks like mission creep. Altogether, the distribution represents about 3% of the fund, and yet in the last 20 years, the fund has kept track with the S&P 500 earning about 9% per annum.
In January 2023, 18,000 acres of timber land were purchased mostly in Bonner and Boundary counties with the expectation that the lands would generate 4% per year. The $50 million came mostly from the purchase of cottage sites at Priest and Payette Lakes. 
Given the proven successful track record of the fund, would it not have been more judicious to direct the windfall money to the widely diversified general fund? No financial adviser worth his salt would recommend putting all your eggs in one basket. 
With reliance on timber sales, the board is at the mercy of a highly cyclical industry which may not have a bright future. So far, engineered wood products have not reached the point where they can compete with traditional wood products, but they offer tremendous long-term advantages. Some products are as strong as steel, fire resistant and can be made of inferior wood such as southern yellow pine which currently is not used for general construction because it lacks strength. 
The ICCU basketball arena at U of I is made from engineered wood as well as the newly remodeled PDX airport. The aesthetic is warm and inviting, and these structures will lock away carbon for a very long time. The purchase of more timber land with the hope of generating 4% is a giveaway. 
So you ask: Who benefits from the school endowment fund; is it Idaho schools or is it the forest products industry of Idaho? Is the Land Board a fiduciary for the endowment lands or for the industry? 
Our school children’s sacred trust is being profaned.

(Photo: Dollywood)We are a nation and state divided — on paper anyway. 
The last presidential election was decided by a difference of 1.47%. Here in Tennessee, Republicans have held a supermajority in the state legislature for a little over a decade, but when given a choice statewide and gerrymandering is taken out, our Tennessee values are a lot less divided than our legislature would reflect. 
If you look at polling from Vanderbilt University, Tennesseans in clear majorities support recreational marijuana, red-flag gun safety laws and exceptions to the abortion ban for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Our Republican-dominated legislature may not do anything about it, but Tennesseans agree on a lot more than we disagree. 
Another thing Tennesseans share in wide agreement? Our complete adoration of singer, songwriter and Tennessee icon Dolly Parton.
Dolly Parton is universally beloved. In 2019, the New York Times put out a piece entitled “Is There Anything We Can All Agree On? Yes: Dolly Parton”  She has always been a topic that could be brought up around a dinner table or in mixed company and agreement can be found. 



				We’d be a lot better off if we saw each other the way we all see Dolly: familiar, human and worth a little grace.			


I grew up on the Cumberland Plateau and spent my birthdays as a child at Dollywood. When I came out as gay, she was an affirming fixture. I have always called her the patron saint of the Southern Queer. She was never loud about her politics — what once was a Tennessee tradition — but she always made clear where she stood. On her recent “Rockstar” album, a song called “World on Fire” has a line:
“Greedy politicians, present and past / They wouldn’t know the truth if it bit ’em in the ass.”
If there’s ever been a bipartisan sentiment, that is it. 
I’m so tired of division. Not disagreement, which is healthy and part of a strong democracy, but the division that we’ve been experiencing for so many years. I’m a Tennessean. I have Republican friends. I don’t always understand their lifestyle or reasoning for their beliefs, but they are my neighbors and I’d really like to be able to acknowledge their presence in Kroger without wondering if I’m safe to be around them.
We’d be a lot better off if we saw each other the way we all see Dolly: familiar, human and worth a little grace.
We’re starting to see a crop of gubernatorial candidates pop up. When the Aftyn Behn/Matt Van Epps race for Congressional District 7 winds up in a few days, I expect we’ll see some more. For any of the candidates, considering running, I’d point them to Dollywood.
Writer Eric Patton gets a little Dolly Parton magic — and cinnamon sugar in his beard. (Photo: Submitted)
As someone who holds a Dollywood season pass, I’m there often. I love going, because the experience reminds me of what is still good about my home. On any given trip to Dollywood, you’ll see a church youth group next to a group of gay men decked out in Dolly shirts. Newlyweds on their honeymoon shopping for knicknacks. A rural family on the only vacation they can afford this year waiting patiently for their time on board Wild Eagle. Immigrants and folks here on tourist visas, all excited to share in home-spun fun and down-home goodness. 
We need a governor who will ask themself “What Would Dolly Do?” She’d make sure Tennesseans are fed, educated and breathing clean air. She’d make sure they’re getting along. She’d make sure they have access to cutting edge healthcare they don’t have to go into bankruptcy over. She’d make sure if something bad happened to their community, she’d fight for everything she could to take care of them. 
I know we can’t get Dolly herself, but whoever it’ll be needs to be as close as we can get. 
Our next governor should be someone who understands the job is more than policy. It’s about restoring the basic social adhesive we’ve let disintegrate. We will need someone who can walk through Dollywood and see the same thing you’ll see on any given day there: people worth loving, not voters worth dividing. 
And if we’re in need of something to get us to stick together, I’m pretty sure there’s some cinnamon sugar stuck in my beard from the last trip.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)This Thanksgiving, families across West Virginia will gather around the table and bow their heads in gratitude. But for too many of us, it’s getting harder to find something to be thankful for.
We are, of course, thankful for what matters most — our friends and families, the people who stand by us when times are tough. We’re grateful for the roof over our heads, the food on our tables, and the laughter that fills our homes, even when the world outside feels uncertain. We’re thankful for neighbors who lend a helping hand, for the church dinners that make sure no one goes hungry, and for the resilience that runs deep in West Virginia’s hills and hollers. These small blessings — love, community and connection — are what carry us through the hard times and remind us what we’re fighting for.
But times are hard right now. Really hard, and under H.R. 1 — the Big, Beautiful Bill — it will only get harder for West Virginians. People are working full-time jobs — sometimes more than one — and still can’t make ends meet. The cost of living has soared, while paychecks have barely budged. A trip to the grocery store evokes a glimpse at one’s bank balance before completing the clicklist. Gas prices creep higher. Rent keeps climbing. The electric bill is a shock every month. Families are cutting corners just to stay afloat — skipping meals, rationing medicine and hoping nothing goes wrong, because one unexpected expense can send everything crashing down. It’s something I’ve been hearing everywhere lately — the same frustrations, the same fears — especially over the last six weeks.
It shouldn’t be this way in America. It especially shouldn’t be this way in West Virginia, where people pride themselves on hard work, faith and taking care of their neighbors. But instead of finding relief this holiday season, we’re watching Congress make choices that will make things worse.
While families are struggling to put food on the table, our leaders in Washington are choosing to take health care away from millions of Americans — including tens of thousands of West Virginians. Cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies will push people out of coverage, forcing parents to choose between taking a sick child to the doctor or keeping the lights on.
And this isn’t abstract — it’s happening right now. When I re-enrolled in my own ACA marketplace plan earlier this month, my premium had increased by 410%. Let that sink in. Four hundred and ten percent. The same plan — except without dental and vision insurance that I have today — but now costing over four times more. I’m not alone. More than 67,000 West Virginians rely on the ACA for health insurance, and many are seeing staggering increases they simply can’t afford. These are real people — neighbors, teachers, small business owners — now forced to decide between health care and survival. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. These are policy choices — deliberate decisions to favor the wealthy and powerful over ordinary people. Congress found the money for new tax breaks for millionaires and big corporations, but somehow there’s “not enough” to help working families see a doctor or afford their prescriptions.
The truth is, this Thanksgiving, West Virginians are paying more and getting less. Grocery prices are up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Prescription drug prices are up. But wages? They’re not keeping up. And when families finally do reach for help — for Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance or affordable coverage through the ACA marketplace — they’re told, “sorry, you’re on your own.”
That’s not gratitude. That’s greed, dressed up in a suit and tie.
When Congress votes to take away health care from people who clean their offices, deliver their mail, care for their children and stock their grocery store shelves, they’re not balancing a budget — they’re breaking a promise. They’re saying the lives of ordinary Americans are expendable. They’re saying it’s acceptable for a child’s asthma to go untreated, for a parent to skip insulin, for a senior to face eviction because medical bills drained their savings.
West Virginians know better. We know that gratitude isn’t just about counting blessings — it’s about sharing them. It’s about making sure everyone has enough to eat, a safe place to live and the ability to see a doctor when they’re sick.
This Thanksgiving, as our leaders in Washington pat themselves on the back for “fiscal responsibility,” let’s remember who’s really paying the price. Not the wealthy. Not the lobbyists. Not the corporations that got yet another round of tax breaks. It’s the single mom in Beckley who lost her health coverage. The retired miner in Logan who can’t afford his blood pressure medication. The family in Charleston wondering how they’ll pay next month’s rent.
So, this year, let’s tell the truth: there’s not a lot to be thankful for when our leaders choose cruelty over compassion. But there is still something to fight for.
Because West Virginians don’t give up easily. We believe in looking out for one another. We believe that every person deserves health care, dignity and a fair shot at a good life.
And we’ll keep fighting — through every cut, every challenge and every broken promise — until compassion guides policy again.

She and her family have lived in an apartment ever since. She got very little help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), she said. When the government failed her, though, her community stepped up. 
Saint Vincent Mission in David helped her — with food, supplies to help her rebuild and volunteers who helped her and her husband with the rebuilding. In turn, Click started volunteering with the Christian organization and now works as the food pantry director.

Click, 39, has also had benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for years. The Wayland woman’s benefit was paused during the recent government shutdown, along with roughly 600,000 other Kentuckians who need the benefit to buy food. 
“That was pretty scary,” said Click, “not knowing how you’re going to feed your family.” 
During the shutdown, Saint Vincent’s food pantry saw about 15-20 new clients in need of food who came in with the “panic of not knowing where their next meal is going to come from.” It made her job as a worker and volunteer at the pantry “that much more important,” she said. 
The shutdown is over, but the fallout from decisions made in Washington could continue for a while. And as the holiday season kicks in, many Kentuckians will need even more help. 
“There’s probably a higher demand of people (who need) holiday meals,” Click said. “Because what they live on now… they probably really can’t spare.” 



How to help:
Halligan said people who want to help neighbors dealing with food insecurity can help in a variety of ways — through donating time, money or food and through advocating for anti-hunger policies. 
“I think it’s up to a household; it’s up to an individual to decide where they can make the most impact, and if somebody can do all three, great, and if they can’t do one, or if they can only do one, pick the one that you can do and lean in,” Halligan said. “And if it’s not with God’s Pantry Food Bank, it’s with some other organization that is part of the hunger safety net — help them. It’s not about God’s Pantry Food Bank. It’s about 280,000 people who need the hunger safety net to work for them.” 
How to get help: 
People in Central and Eastern Kentucky can go to https://www.godspantry.org/help and search for the food pantry nearest them, by ZIP code. Anyone in Kentucky can search for help by county at https://feedingky.org/get-help/.



An ‘unconscionable level of increased food insecurity’

Michael Halligan, the president and CEO God’s Pantry Food Bank, said the hunger safety net has gotten an energy boost in 2025 thanks to public awareness of hunger that increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I see community leaning in more than I’ve ever seen. Volunteers, neighbors experiencing hunger, sponsors, businesses, elected officials, I see community leaning in more than I’ve ever seen, and some of that is the circumstances of the time,” Halligan said. “We often talk about Kentuckians being resilient. What I see is the blessings of people helping people that allows that resiliency to become apparent, that allows that resiliency to happen, and if it’s not for community engagement, I’m not sure where we would be.” 
During the recent government shutdown, God’s Pantry saw a 40% increase in food insecurity in the 50 counties the organization serves, Halligan said. Before the shutdown, about 280,000 people in Central and Eastern Kentucky were living with food insecurity, he said. From the first week of October to the first week of November, around 400,000 people needed food help.
“Those were federal workers without paychecks. Those were folks who had never experienced hunger before that, all of a sudden, were asking, ‘What do I do? How do I get food?’” Halligan said. “Those were folks that lost SNAP benefits, even for a short period of time, and we’re still seeing the impact of that. It will take a while to recover. It will take a while for everything to kind of restabilize.” 
This increase in food insecurity in an already hungry state was daunting, Halligan said: “The instantaneous impact of that unconscionable level of increased food insecurity was difficult to deal with.”

The organization was able to bump up food distribution thanks to financial and food donations, he said, but food pantries can never replace SNAP benefits, which provide roughly nine meals for every one meal food pantries can offer, according to Feeding America. 
God’s Pantry, part of the Feeding Kentucky network, also got some of the funds from the $5 million pot Gov. Andy Beshear allocated to food banks from the rainy day fund. 
Still, God’s Pantry and other food pantry networks could see increased demand even beyond the holiday season.  
On Nov. 1, changes to the SNAP program passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act went into effect.  Veterans, the homeless, recent foster care youth and adults ages 54-64 are no longer exempt from work requirements to receive food benefits for themselves and their families. 
“We’re prepared to be able to do the things that we need to do to provide assistance, but we don’t know exactly what the number is yet,” Halligan said. 
The expanded work requirements, mandated by the federal budget bill, are expected to cost 114,000 Kentuckians their food assistance, policy experts have estimated.

Volunteers keep the food safety net wheel turning, Halligan said. In 2024, more than 5,000 volunteers contributed about 33,000 hours of work to God’s Pantry. 
“Imagine if we had to pay for all of that,” he said. “We would not be able to distribute as much food, because we would have more payroll costs.” 
At the Sharing Thanksgiving event Monday, at least 30 volunteers were spread across the parking lot to greet meal recipients, check people in, load cars and more. 
Joey Waddell, the chief operating officer at Highlands Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH), was among the volunteers loading turkeys and Thanksgiving meal staples into vehicles.
“We try to be involved in as many community giving events that we can to help those that don’t have the means that maybe other folks do,” Waddell said, crediting his Christian faith with the desire to help others. He also recently participated in a dancing fundraiser for unhoused people and a coat drive for children. 
“Everybody’s appreciative and thanking us,” he said. “Putting others first, that’s where my heart is.”

Phil Mills, a respiratory therapist, God’s Pantry volunteer and the director of Fishes and Loaves, a community food pantry associated with St. James Episcopal Church in Prestonsburg, said he’s always found himself in a “helping role.” Mills was also out at Big Sandy on Monday to help keep the line of cars moving. 
“I do enjoy helping people,” said Mills, 56, who grew up in Martin County. “There’s a big need. There’s a lot of people that need. I always thought I grew up poor, until I’ve seen some other families and (realized) I had a lot. Probably not everything everybody wants, but there’s always somebody in worse shape than you.” 
His father worked in the coal mines, Mills said. He and his four siblings got a small, meaningful present or two at Christmas.  
“Now, I see all these people coming in. We have mothers come in with children; they can’t feed them, they don’t have toys for them,” he said. At Fishes and Loaves, staff try to find little toys and snacks for the kids — something extra to make them happy. 
“I’ve always been a helper. I’ve been a caregiver for parents, partners, relatives that needed other things. It’s just the caregiver in me,” Mills said. “People say I have a big heart. I don’t know if it’s a big heart. I just like helping others. I hate to see people hungry.” 
Anyone can find themselves in a position where they need food assistance, Halligan said. They could lose a loved one or a job, be in a traffic accident or find themselves caught between the politics of a government shutdown. 
“What I see right now is community understanding that more than they’ve ever understood it,” Halligan said. “We often talk about sharing the blessings of life around the Thanksgiving table, and that’s what sharing Thanksgiving is about. But I see people starting to understand the importance of sharing those moments 365 days a year, not one.”

State police will get an additional $69.3 million for operations, enough to fund four new cadet classes to increase its ranks. Staffing is critical for the 1,279 municipalities that don’t have police departments and rely solely on troopers for their law enforcement needs. 
“Our focus is firmly on safeguarding the public and ensuring that every community within the Commonwealth receives the support it requires during critical times,” said State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. “These investments are crucial in providing our members with the tools and resources needed to respond promptly and effectively to urgent situations, ultimately enhancing our collective resilience.”

Emergency management will receive $40 million in its disaster response fund, up from $20 million, “to offset (the) sudden loss in federal support,” according to a press release from the agency. The Trump administration has sought to transform the Federal Emergency Management Agency and publicly discussed shifting more responsibility to the states. 
Another $5 million bump to the Commonwealth Disaster Recovery Assistance Program will increase direct support to impacted Pennsylvanians.
“Programs like DRAP make an immediate and meaningful difference for our communities. After the May 13th flooding, many Somerset County residents were able to rely on DRAP to help begin their recovery when they needed it most. This support filled a critical gap for families who were facing unexpected losses,” said Somerset County Emergency Management Agency Director Joel Landis.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas voters have a good bit to be grateful for this Thanksgiving holiday, as the 2026 election season picks up steam.
Voters in Senate District 26 and House District 70, especially, can thank the state Supreme Court for denying Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request to delay compliance with two circuit court rulings that ordered special elections in those districts be held sooner than Sanders previously set them.
Voters in both districts sued after Sanders set special elections for June 9 to replace a deceased senator and a representative who resigned to take a job with Arkansas PBS. The plaintiffs argued the election date, coming well past the end of the Legislature’s fiscal session, deprived them of representation in violation of the state and federal constitutions.
In defiant Nov. 16 proclamations, Sanders reluctantly rescheduled the general elections in the two legislative districts for March 3, the same day as the 2026 party primaries elsewhere in Arkansas. She set the primaries in the two districts for Jan. 6, barely six weeks from today.
Sanders said she complied with the two court orders she’d tried to stop “under duress.” She stubbornly insisted that the court’s decision was “unlawful” and said she remained confident she’d prevail as the appeal continues.
That confidence requires faith that the Arkansas Supreme Court will reverse itself and the two lower court judges before Jan. 6. I find it hard to believe the state’s high court will halt an election it’s already said needs to be held sooner rather than later. I find it even harder to believe that the justices will declare an election null and void once the votes are cast. Not impossible, but unlikely.
Regardless, voters in Senate District 26, many of whom oppose a Sanders-backed plan to put a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, have a surfeit of candidates to choose from come Jan. 6 as five Republicans vie to replace the late Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch. Stubblefield had been a staunch opponent of the administration’s choice of the site for the prison.
The winner of the primary will face independent candidate Adam Watson, a founding director of Gravel & Grit, a nonprofit dedicated to opposing the prison.
District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
Voters in House District 70, which had been held by Republican Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock, get to choose between two Democrats on Jan. 6, with the winner facing a Republican candidate on March 3. District 70 lies entirely within Pulaski County.
 The bigger picture

Those aren’t the only Arkansas voters who should feel thankful this year, as Democrats field 75 candidates across executive, legislative and congressional races in hopes of loosening the Republican lock on the state’s congressional seats and reducing the GOP supermajority in the General Assembly. 
Those candidates provide voters ample opportunity to decide whether they want “change or more of the same,” to steal a phrase longtime political observer Skip Rutherford used in reference to the national political stage a week ago.
The former dean of the Clinton School of Public Service characterized the election of Democrats with widely divergent political views — from the Democratic Socialist mayor of New York City to the moderate governors of Virginia and New Jersey — as “send-a-message” elections.
From a national standpoint, the dissatisfaction of voters over the price of groceries and the rising cost of health insurance will be a message that Republicans and Democrats ignore at their peril in 2026’s midterms, Rutherford said at an Arkansas Times-sponsored lecture.
Rutherford, an adviser to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, drew comparisons between the recent Democratic victories and that election’s “It’s the economy, stupid” slogan, attributed to campaign consultant James Carville.
I think Rutherford’s right, but Republicans can also use the economy card, and it’ll be interesting to see how that plays out in legislative races next year, especially with Sanders’ active involvement in several races.

(Photo Sharon Sullivan/Colorado Newsline)When the Trump administration requested that Colorado transfer custody of Tina Peters from the state to the federal government, there was only one plausible response: Not in a million years.
But Gov. Jared Polis seems to have a different idea.
For some mysterious reason, he appears to think there might be some merit to the request. No matter how he comes down on the matter, he has already undermined the rule of law and insulted every local official who helps manage honest elections in the face of right-wing extremist threats.

Peters is serving time in state prison, and for good reason: The Republican former Mesa County clerk was the linchpin in a plan to breach the security of her own election equipment to prove the “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen. She was convicted in state court of multiple counts related to the scheme, including four felonies, and sentenced to almost nine years behind bars.
The local district attorney who prosecuted the case was a Republican in a county that favored Trump by 28 percentage points, and there is no credible reason to think the conviction was unjust or compromised by politics.
But in MAGA America, what matters more than anything is personal loyalty to President Donald Trump, which Peters offers in ample measure. That’s why the president has repeatedly demanded that she be released, claiming preposterously that “she did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat in the Election” and promising “harsh measures” if Colorado fails to comply.
In March, J. Bishop Grewell, then the acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, and Peter McNeilly, then an assistant U.S. attorney for Colorado, were among three Justice Department officials who told a federal judge in Colorado they were reviewing the state’s prosecution of Peters. This month, Trump’s Bureau of Prisons formally made a request to the Colorado Department of Corrections to transfer her to federal custody.
The request is corrupt and deserves no consideration. Trump wants to aid a criminal ally, as he’s already done so many times since January.
“One is only left to assume that either the Trump administration wants her moved to federal custody so that they could somehow then release her outside of the jurisdiction of Colorado, which would be a blockbuster obstruction of justice by the U.S. government against a lawful state criminal order, or they want to put her in federal custody to give her some improved conditions,” lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, said during an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen.
Yet more than a week after the Trump administration sent its request to the state, Polis’ office in a statement to Newsline said he was still “reviewing” the request.
There’s nothing to review. As stated by Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general, and Dan Rubinstein, the Republican district attorney who prosecuted Peters, in a joint letter last week imploring Polis to deny the administration’s request, Trump “has no legal basis to interfere with the sentence in this case,” and the request is an attempt “to circumvent Colorado’s sovereignty.”
Even if Polis ultimately decides to deny the request, his long silence in the face of such brazen lawlessness has already made him look weak, and it has done real damage. During a Tuesday press conference, when a bipartisan group of local election officials from around the state exhorted Polis to deny the request, county clerks said they have experienced an “immediate uptick in concerns about safety” in relation to the Peters case.
The clerks said they have yet to even hear from Polis, even though they sent him a letter last week requesting a meeting with him about Peters.
This is hardly the first time Polis has appeared to accommodate Trump or fully sided with team MAGA. His administration has been all too eager to supply sensitive information about Colorado residents to ICE as part of Trump’s inhumane mass deportation program. 
In the Peters case, he risks undermining the rule of law and fueling doubts about voting in a state where brave Democratic and Republican officials have done so much to defend free and fair elections.
He owes it to anyone who hopes systems of justice can withstand authoritarian attacks to quickly, forcefully and publicly tell the Trump administration that Peters isn’t going anywhere.

The measures come as Virginia ramps up for the expected increase in traffic, which is also being driven by travelers avoiding air travel as the federal government cuts back on flights due to a shortage of air traffic controllers. 
An additional 1.6 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home over the holiday period between Nov. 25-Dec. 1, compared to the previous record of 80.2 million, according to AAA.
 Buckle up before taking off

Last March, Virginia passed a new traffic law requiring all passengers, whether in the front or back seats of the vehicle, to be properly buckled up. The previous law only required adults to wear seat belts when occupying the front seat, which contributed to Virginia raking the worst in the nation for seat belt use in 2023 with just 73.2% of residents buckling up, far below the national average of 91.9%, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
After tragic losses, mothers push for stronger driving laws in Virginia

“We are literally the worst at wearing our seat belts,” said Christy King, a Virginian resident, on a recent episode of the Responder Safety podcast. King advocated for the law change last January, following the death of her son, Christopher, in a car crash.
The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles advises rideshare drivers and passengers to comply, as well.
Last year, five of the eight people who died in crashes during the holiday period were not wearing a seatbelt. Virginia also recorded 768 traffic-related injuries in the same time frame. The new law follows the annual nationwide Click It or Ticket campaign, which raises awareness about seat belt use.
“Whether you’re traveling across the commonwealth to visit family or just heading down the street, remember that everyone wants to make it home safely for the holidays,” said DMV Commissioner Gerald Lackey, the governor’s highway safety representative, in a statement. “Be patient, be courteous, and buckle up. The best gift you can give your loved ones is your safe arrival.”
 Express lanes, closures

On Friday, the 2.5-mile extension of the Interstate 495 Express Lanes in Northern Virginia opened, which officials say will ease congestion in the area. The new lanes have already created some concern about the possible bottleneck the traffic would create going into Maryland.
The extension starts near the Dulles Corridor Interchange and terminates just before the American Legion Bridge, and includes new connecting ramps. The extension also includes new bridges carrying sidewalks and a shared-use trail parallel to Interstate 495, upgraded noise walls to protect nearby neighborhoods, and express bus service connecting Virginia to Maryland via the American Legion Bridge.
The extension is part of the $660 million 495 NEXT project between Virginia and Transurban, private partner and operator of the existing I-95, I-395 and I-495 Express Lanes. Construction began in March 2022. Final completion is expected to occur mid-2026.
Beginning Wednesday at noon, the Virginia Department of Transportation will suspend many highway work zones and lift temporary lane closures on interstates and other major roadways statewide until noon on Dec. 1. The transportation agency said motorists may encounter semi-permanent work zones. 
Travelers can check VDOT’s list of travel advisories for notices around the commonwealth.
Express-lane directionality on Interstates 95 and 395 will be adjusted for holiday traffic, providing a cost benefit for motorists. On Thanksgiving, the lanes will operate southbound all day.
Drivers with three or more people in the car and an E-ZPass Flex set to “HOV ON” can ride for free. 
Travelers who need to cross bodies of water between the Hampton Roads Peninsula and Southside during construction of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel Expansion Project are encouraged to use alternate routes such as the I-664 Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, the Route 17 James River Bridge, the free Jamestown-Scotland Ferry or I-95 to minimize potential delays.
Motorists using Route 17’s George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge should expect delays between 45 and 60 minutes due to mechanical issues. No work requiring lane closures will be conducted at any of the water crossings during the Thanksgiving holiday.

(Photo by Getty Images)On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets – William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels – he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
 Devotion in the service of unity

It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The firsttook place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 – Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving – which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November – it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”


Washington’s proclamation was printed in newspapers throughout the country. George Washington’s Mt. Vernon
 ‘Pardon our national…transgressions’

As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals – just like the prisoners in the New York City jail – thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message – not simply a message, but a “proclamation” – sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

The center is trying to get a handle on industry-wide financial issues. (Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)At first glance, The Growing Years Early Childhood Center in Manchester doesn’t look like it’s financially struggling. The parking lot is full, and the hallways are loud with the sounds of infants and playing toddlers. But the main hall leads to an empty classroom because Kitty Larochelle, the center’s executive director, can’t afford what’s necessary to reopen it. 
“That could fit up to 14 toddlers,” Larochelle said. “We would need four teachers for that classroom, and right now that’s just not feasible.” 
Despite being at capacity and having a waitlist, The Growing Years and other early childhood education centers in New Hampshire are struggling to stay afloat. Even centers in the state’s more populated areas are finding it difficult to make ends meet.
Centers barely, if at all, break even because they cannot charge “the true cost of care” without raising already-expensive tuition. The most recent data shows that the average annual price for an infant in center-based child care was $17,250, and the average price for an infant and a 4-year-old was $31,868 in 2023, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. 
Meanwhile, low salaries for child care workers have contributed to a workforce shortage and exacerbated capacity issues as a result. According to Larochelle, it is a “balancing act” for her and other center directors to get a handle on the challenges, as everything goes hand in hand.  
“We have to be highly, highly aware that most of our income comes from our families, so we can’t overcharge our families and feel good about that,” said Larochelle. “But at the same time, we’re trying to get our staff wages to a reasonable amount so that we maintain our workers.” 
Expensive expenses
Nearly everything that goes into running a child care facility carries a high price tag. 
“We’re broke all the time,” said Marianne Barter, executive director of Merrimack Valley Day Care Service, a nonprofit in Concord and Boscawen that prioritizes care for children at risk of abuse and neglect.  
Salaries and benefits are the biggest expense of most centers, Barter said. Additionally, providing healthy food and diapers, paying the mortgage or rent on their five locations, utilities, and building maintenance contribute to tight finances. 
“I have horrible buildings,” Barter said, including one that experienced heating and plumbing issues in late October. “Many child care facilities are in buildings that were not intended to be child care facilities. … [It] is a constant nightmare.”
Additionally, businesses must have insurance and keep up with state child care licensing standards, both of which providers say are expensive. Centers struggle to find affordable liability insurance because agencies offer it sparingly, and those who do can charge high premiums due to the risk.  
Barter almost had to close her center’s doors when her former insurance agency stopped offering child care insurance, but ended up securing a policy from a different insurer.
“You’d be out of your mind not to have liability insurance,” Barter said. In New Hampshire, child care businesses are only required to have workers’ compensation insurance. “Kids get hurt all the time. You could get sued at any time. These are other people’s children. This is the most important thing in someone’s life and they’re entrusting it with you every single day. The risk involved with that is incredible.” 
There is a financial difference between nonprofit and for-profit centers, but both Barter and Larochelle said it is small and comes down to taxes and grant eligibility. Across the industry, employers are managing employees who are struggling to pay rent, fix their cars, and care for their own children. 
“I assume it’s on average with everyone else,” Barter said about how running a nonprofit early education center is different. “Even if we’re doing a little bit better, it’s like being the skinniest kid at fat camp. Nothing glorious about it.”
The Growing Years raised tuition for the first time in two years this year to try to combat their financial challenges. Larochelle said it is “extremely difficult” to balance her budget. 
“Even though we are a for-profit center, I can tell you it’s like for very little profit, because we are taking care of our staff the best that we can and are still being mindful of the families we serve,” she said. 
Workforce shortage ripples
For the past decade, the child care industry has experienced high employee turnover, and businesses are struggling to recruit workers due to low wages. According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the median yearly salary of child care workers is $32,490, less than that of preschool teachers, kindergarten teachers, and almost all other occupations in the state. 
A bachelor’s degree, an associate’s degree, or a certificate in the field is required for early childhood education providers. People with degrees can make more at a pre-school than at an early learning center, which draws them away from the field. 
“There’s not a lot of people who want to enter the field making $15 an hour,” said Shannon Tremblay, director of New Hampshire’s legislatively enacted Child Care Advisory Committee. 
The inability to pay employees properly is a personal burden for child care directors. When asked about it, Larochelle could not put it into words. Barter said said she wasn’t sure she could describe it.
“The fact that I cannot pay these incredible people what they are worth is just constant frustration,” she said. “As a person who runs this agency, it feels awful when I know one of my staff is struggling. God, I hate that and my board hates it, too.” 
As a result, businesses lack a sufficient number of employees to maintain the legally required child-to-adult ratios, resulting in a capacity shortage. There are more children needing care than spots available, even if a business has the classroom space in its building. Without the staff, those classrooms stay closed. 
“They may have one or two classrooms that they’re not filling and they can’t fill them because they don’t have staff,” Tremblay said. “They could fill it with their wait list, probably threefold, but they can’t bring in those kiddos because they don’t have the staff.” 
The empty classroom at The Growing Years has been that way since the COVID-19 pandemic. Larochelle said that hiring new employees is a “gamble” because if they quit, families could risk having care stripped away. 
“We don’t want to open up a classroom and then find out that employees don’t stay more than two months because that puts in jeopardy care for 14 families,” she said. “We want to make sure that we have a solid base and that we can provide care on a daily basis, and even if someone calls out that we have someone who can fill in and we can still meet our ratios.” 
To address staffing issues, Larochelle said she tries to “cultivate” her own staff by hiring and mentoring interested people at the center while they earn their degree or certification in early childhood education. She said it’s necessary because “early childhood education is not really promoted as a sustainable income to live off of.” 
For veteran providers, Larochelle has tried to increase the incentives. Providers have a half-day off each week, leaving by noon. In the past, the center has held fundraisers for families and employees to help during difficult times. Larochelle said the center’s owner has helped with household expenses, such as new car tires.
“We care for our staff as if they were family. We support each other, we’re always checking in,” she said. “It’s an extremely difficult and challenging job if done right,” said Larochelle. “Those who don’t care don’t stay in the field.”
State investment is low but growing
The state offers the Child Care Scholarship Program, but it helps families, not businesses. The CCSP reduces the cost of child care for eligible families by providing direct payments to qualified providers. 
While the program is great for easing a family’s access to early education for their children, Barter said it does not help businesses, since the state is not paying them the actual cost of care, just the average. 
“We do not collect a cost share, we just bill the state and this is a gap,” Barter said. “From an affordability standpoint, when the state moves over to a cost-of-care model instead of a market rate model, that’s going to be hugely impactful for child care centers, because it’s going to mean that the rate they pay for scholarship students is going to be based on the actual cost, not just the average of what we all charge, which is never enough.”
The Department of Health and Human Services has made child care a priority for the biennium, but has also left $15 million in funding for child care employers in limbo by trying to fund it with federal dollars. 
In the 2026 legislative session, legislation is proposed to give businesses a tax credit for expanding child care, to use state funds for $15 million in child care for employers, and to ease municipal zoning requirements that are making it hard for new businesses to open. However, there is also legislation to repeal the state’s $15 million allocation to child care employers. 
“When we don’t show up, there’s an awful lot of people who do not show up for work. That on its own should have more value than it does in this state,” Barter said. “For every person I hire, eight other people get to go to work. I can’t think of any other job that’s like that.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/growingyearsbiz-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 05:56:18.786224

One of the main debates at the Ohio Statehouse this year has revolved around how to fix and reduce the skyrocketing property tax burdens.
“People are suffering, they’re losing their homes,” Lakewood resident Beth Blackmarr said.
But the legislature has to remember they need to support public schools, Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt said.
“We continue to need operating dollars,” Hunt said.
Lawmakers passed four bills that Republicans say deal with the first issue, providing help for taxpayers.
“These are very, very important reform bills that are really the most consequential in almost half a century,” state Rep. David Thomas (R-Jefferson) said.
House Bills 186 and 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation. These bills passed both chambers in a bipartisan fashion.
H.B. 309 allows county budget commissions to reduce property tax levies. It mainly passed along party lines, but a few Democrats joined the Republicans to pass it, while several members of the GOP voted no.
H.B. 129 implements a check on tax increases from school levies. In the House, it passed overwhelmingly, but in the Senate, all Democrats and state Sen. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) voted no.
“We will no longer have huge increases in people’s property tax bills if they did not vote for that,” Thomas said.
Schools have been arguing for months now that these bills take away much-needed dollars for kids, when they are already facing cuts from the state in expected funding.
“We’ll talk about [cutting] staffing, which impacts what programs we might consider to remain here at Parma and those that we might not be able to support,” Hunt told me. “Certainly, those things impact the quality of education we can provide for our students.”
The district will need to dramatically reduce its services if its levies continue to fail, he added.
“Everything will be on the table: transportation, potentially participation fees, we’ll be looking at our buildings,” Hunt said.
But Lakewood homeowner Beth Blackmarr, who is fighting to abolish property taxes altogether, said she doesn’t want to hurt the schools. Lawmakers aren’t doing enough to actually provide relief, she said.
“They knew they were supposed to do something,” Blackmarr said. “They ignored it in favor of pet projects like the Browns stadium.”
Instead of spending months focusing on how to use unclaimed funds to move the Browns to Brook Park, she said, affordability should have been the legislature’s focus.
Thomas said it has been his priority, and he plans to continue that.
“It is not enough,” Thomas said. “We need to do much more.”
It’s unclear how much money this legislation would actually save taxpayers like Blackmarr. But she said one thing is clear — these bills needed to pass years ago to actually impact her bills.
“This is a huge problem, and, by the way, a problem of the legislation’s own making,” Blackmarr said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-26 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT begins broader debate over vanishing federal funds,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/26/ct-begins-broader-debate-over-vanishing-federal-funds/,State leaders now must decide whether CT should indefinitely dedicate millions to reverse gaps created by retreating federal funding.,"State officials recently reserved $500 million, on paper, to bolster federal human service programs for roughly two months.
But this emergency funding really represents the start of a much broader debate.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the Democratic-controlled General Assembly now must decide whether Connecticut should indefinitely dedicate state dollars — potentially for several years — to reverse new gaps in health care, nutrition, and energy and housing assistance created by retreating federal funding.
“The need to be looking holistically, long-term, at these things is important,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told the Connecticut Mirror this week.
“We don’t know how dire the [federal funding] crisis will be,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who noted Connecticut could be dealing with a devolving federal funding situation for an array of core programs for years to come. “Are we really going to go over a cliff?”
At the bottom of that potential cliff are more than 140,000 enrollees in Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance exchange, who stand to lose federal subsidies that cover all or a portion of their premium costs. The New York Times reported this week that President Donald Trump is weighing a possible extension of those benefits but hasn’t reached a decision yet.
Also at risk are an estimated 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness who are at risk of losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits between Dec. 1 and March 31 because of new work requirements and other rules changes.
Both stem not from the 43-day federal government shutdown, which ran from Oct. 1 through mid-November, but rather from ongoing cutbacks ordered in July by the Republican-led Congress and Trump.
Most of the federal funding cuts in that bill, particularly those centered on Medicaid, don’t take effect until 2027 or 2028.
But there are others, besides nutrition assistance and health insurance subsidies, that will be felt sooner.
Since federal funding for the thousands of Connecticut students who receive free and reduced price school meals is determined partly by SNAP caseloads, school districts could be facing reductions there.
And to help pay for federal tax cuts also enacted as part of that omnibus July measure, the Trump administration has recommended cuts in 2026 to some forms of affordable housing assistance for many more.
So, while state officials agreed to use $500 million from last fiscal year’s surplus to potentially mitigate federal cutbacks in human service programs between now and Feb. 4, when the regular 2026 General Assembly session starts, the populations at risk now still could be in jeopardy two months from now and likely long after, absent state intervention.
“What’s more, excessive tariffs have made life more unaffordable — from groceries to housing to holiday gift-giving,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children. “Connecticut must be vigilant and proactive so that our residents are protected.”
Lamont, who has sole authority to propose disbursements from the $500 million response fund this winter, already has begun talks with legislative leaders on how to use that money.
The governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, traditionally been wary of using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
But Lamont also said last week that “we’re going to take care of people in need.”
When asked earlier this month whether he would support a state-funded SNAP benefit to protect the 36,000 recipients affected by recent federal rules changes, the governor was open but noncommittal, saying only “we’re looking at that.”
He also said his administration is working with state Comptroller Sean Scanlon to develop a new option to help residents and small businesses buy affordable health insurance. The governor last week tapped Scanlon’s chief health policy aide, Josh Wojcik, to become the administration’s new budget director.
But regardless of whether Lamont dedicates portions of the $500 million reserve to bolster weakened federal human service programs this winter, legislative leaders say they expect many Democratic state legislators next year will want to commit state funds on an ongoing basis toward this social safety net.
“This is just not a normal situation,” Ritter said, predicting Connecticut and many other states may spend the next few years deciding what degree of federal cutbacks are intolerable. And if so, Ritter added, states also must decide how much of their own funds they can afford to spend to improve the situation.
But while Lamont and top state lawmakers also say Connecticut never can afford to reverse all federal cutbacks, they also note it has more options financially than do most other states.
With more than $4.3 billion in its rainy day fund, equal to 18% of the annual General Fund, Connecticut has one of the larger budget reserves in the nation.
And unlike most other states, Connecticut also has a complex series of budget caps that force large annual surpluses.
Surpluses here since 2017 have averaged more than $1.8 billion per year, about 8% to 9% of the General Fund. Connecticut has used those dollars to build reserves and whittle down its considerable pension debt.
And if Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly seek to bolster federal human service programs by scaling back those surpluses somewhat, they could face strong opposition from minority Republicans.
GOP leaders during the federal government shutdown last month, when state aid from Washington was stalled temporarily, endorsed using $500 million from last fiscal year’s state budget surplus to prop up federal nutrition and heating assistance programs.
But if Connecticut is going to launch new state spending, year after year, to replace vanishing dollars from Washington, it shouldn’t come at the expense of local efforts to pay down pension debt, Republicans say.
Connecticut entered this fiscal year with $33.5 billion in unfunded pension obligations, a burden created by more than seven decades of improper savings prior to 2011, and still carries one of the highest debt levels in this category nationwide.
If Connecticut is going to start providing nutrition benefits, heating assistance or health care subsidies on an ongoing basis, said state Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, then officials here should pay for them through matching spending cuts elsewhere in the state budget.
“We always need to make sure everyone is fed and everyone’s home is heated,” he said. But “it’s about prioritization.”
Harding added that “it’s a very dangerous precedent to set if we basically say we as a state government are going to address every single cut that comes our way from the federal government.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_6004.jpg,,,2025-11-26 05:56:18.786224

States have gotten creative in trying to lower patients’ prescription drug copays by targeting different parts of the drug supply chain. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)Fruth Pharmacy, a small chain that once had more than 20 stores in southeastern Ohio and nearby towns in West Virginia and Kentucky, has announced that it is closing and selling its prescriptions to Walgreens next month.
Given Walgreens’ own financial woes, the news could add to the growing problem with pharmacy deserts in rural areas of both states. 
Lynne Fruth, president of the 73-year-old chain, has been a vocal critic of pharmacy middlemen owned by giant health conglomerates. Each is among the 15 largest corporations in the United States, and together, their middlemen control nearly 80% of prescription drug transactions.
The middlemen are called pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs. Their owners — CVS Health, UnitedHealth and Cigna-Express Scripts — have pharmacy operations of their own, and their middlemen determine how much to reimburse their competitors and affiliated pharmacies for the drugs they dispense.
That’s an obvious conflict, Fruth has maintained.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By reimbursing pharmacies less money than a medication costs, PBMs have caused the closure of thousands of pharmacies across America,” Fruth said in a written statement that was reported by WCHS in Charleston. “The continued closings of pharmacies must be a wake up call for lawmakers to hold PBMs accountable before all pharmacies disappear.”
Andy Becker, the chain’s CEO, said that it’s been under stress from PBMs for years, but a cyberattack against a company owned by one of the conglomerates was the proximate cause of the demise of Fruth Pharmacy.
Change Healthcare, which is owned by UnitedHeath Group, handles payment and prescription processing for thousands of pharmacies. It was the victim of a ransomware attack in early 2024.
It meant that Fruth couldn’t fill any prescriptions for six days. Then it couldn’t fill electronic prescriptions for another week.
“That’s 90% of our new prescriptions that were coming in,” Becker said in an interview. “Then for another eight to 10 days, our controlled substance prescriptions weren’t coming in. We couldn’t win. If I can’t fill your prescription, you’re going to Walmart or wherever. And once somebody moves somewhere else, they’re not coming back until they get mad at Walmart or Walgreens or wherever they move. In that three or four-week period, we lost 15% of our customers.”
The Fruth closing comes after 223 other Ohio pharmacies shut their doors last year, according to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. The number still in operation dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory.
In addition to small chains and independent pharmacies going out of business, Rite Aid declared two bankruptcies and closed all its stores — including hundreds in Ohio and Michigan.
Pharmacy closures can be particularly hard on the poor and elderly in small communities such as Wellston, Ohio, where a Fruth store closed earlier this year. If customers’ prescriptions are transferred to the Walgreens in Jackson, that means they have to find a way to travel 10 miles each way. That”s not an easy task if you can’t drive or if you lack reliable transportation.
For many such customers, a pharmacist can be the only medical professional to whom they have ready access. A pharmacist can help them manage chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.
Fruth is transferring prescriptions to Walgreens, which has faced troubles of its own. In March, the pharmacy chain announced that it was selling itself to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Such businesses are known for aggressively cutting what they see as underperforming assets.
Unlike CVS, Walgreens doesn’t own a PBM. Such middlemen decide which drugs are covered by insurance, and they negotiate huge, non-transparent rebates in exchange for putting drugmakers’ products on their formularies. That’s a mechanism that pushes up list prices of drugs, according to the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center.
The conglomerates that own the big-three PBMs also own top-10 insurance companies. 
In addition, CVS owns the largest retail chain. And it, UnitedHealth and Cigna-Express Scripts own mail-order and specialty pharmacies as well. Their PBMs decide how much to reimburse their own pharmacies and those of their competitors — raising suspicions that they favor their affiliated stores.
In January, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report accusing the big PBMs of wild price hikes and possibly steering patients away from competing pharmacies.
But the term expired of the FTC chair who led the effort. Then President Donald Trump tried to remove two Democratic appointees who also supported scrutinizing PBMs.

“Members of my generation want the ability to shape our future,” Fromuth said in an interview this month. “It’s really important to bring them together and give them hope, get them aware, get them angry, but also say, ‘Hey, we’re in this together, and we’re going to be in this together until we get the job done.’” 
Since Donald Trump was reelected, she’s been joining actions, such as those organized by her local chapter of Indivisible, a progressive organization initiated as a reaction to Trump’s first presidency. And, while she respects the work being done, when she looks around at those leading it, she sees people twice her age. 
So she decided to start The Franklin Project — named after U.S. Constitution drafter Benjamin Franklin — a network of 16 to 35-year-old Mainers united to fight authoritarianism through non-violent protests and canvassing. 
“It’s our future,” Framuth said of her and the handful of other young Mainers who have joined her effort so far. 
Framuth intends to shape that future using two distinct methods: demonstrations and one-on-one conversations. 
The project will have a human rights rapid-response team that works with local groups to stage protests, such as immigrant advocacy organizations to respond when someone in the community is mistreated by federal immigration authorities. But these won’t be typical protests with signs and chants, she said. 
While the group will eventually come up with its methods together, Framuth said she’s inspired by groups that push for change through financial pressure. One example is recent protests against Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration through boycotts of his company Tesla and demonstrations in showrooms. The company’s stock has since plunged. 
Closer to home, Framuth is inspired by the tactics used by the group that organized against the Wells Police Department’s contract with federal immigration authorities, specifically sun-up to sun-down protests, which she thinks show determination. The police department ended its contract in October after months of objections through local protests and comments at select board meetings. 
The Franklin Project will also organize what Framuth calls the citizen’s canvass, which will involve its members knocking on doors in their communities to speak with their neighbors about their broad concerns with what’s happening to American democracy, rather than a specific issue or candidate. 
“In most cases, I’m sure they will say ‘no’ at the start,” Framuth said, “and then we will just recalibrate and figure out, ‘OK, what are the ways in which we can communicate better?’” 
When Trump began his second term in January, Framuth had been taking classes abroad through the School for Ethics and Global Leadership, a semester-long residential program for high school juniors focused on ethical thinking skills and leadership development. 
She was placed in an apartment with people of various political ideologies, as the school selects a diverse cross section of students from across the U.S. to attend, and she said that experience taught her that everyone has more in common than they think. 
“These people, who before that program I thought gotta be somewhat out of their mind, turned out to be very good friends of mine,” Framuth said. “We worked through a lot of our political differences — we are still working through those differences.” 
She’s now hoping to scale up her own personal experience through the citizen’s canvass, which she sees as an antidote to authoritarianism.  
“That’s one of the ways that an authoritarian government succeeds, is when it really divides the population,” Framuth said. “If you want to prove them wrong, then say, ‘Hey, you actually can’t divide us.’” 
The first meeting of The Franklin Project will occur at 6 p.m. on Dec. 7 in Portland at a location to be determined.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Katya_no-kings-portland-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-26 04:57:20.259765

Ohio has 24 counties without an OB-GYN, including two that border Union County — Champaign and Hardin, according to the nonpartisan nonprofit KFF, an independent source of research and information on national health issues. The data they used was from 2021.
The 24 counties without an OB-GYN according to KFF are: Adams County, Athens County, Belmont County, Carroll County, Champaign County, Fayette County, Fulton County, Hardin County, Harrison County, Hocking County, Jackson County, Meigs County, Monroe County, Morgan County, Morrow County, Noble County, Ottawa County, Paulding County, Perry County, Pike County, Putnam County, Shelby County, Vinton County, and Wyandot County. 
“We do have patients that travel 30 plus minutes from Champaign County, they either travel to us or they travel to Springfield,” Martter said, who has been an OB-GYN in Marysville for 16 years. “There’s also Hardin County, which is a maternity care desert. I have patients that travel from Kenton to see me, which is probably 45-ish minutes.”
Patients might have to take time off work to get to their appointments or might need to get a babysitter to watch their other children. A lot of times patients driving farther distances have to rely on back roads, Martter said.
“There’s no freeway,” she said. “We’re hoping that the roads are safe to travel on, that there hasn’t been an accident that puts them behind even more trying to get back to their job or their children. It does really impact them and their availability to come to us.”
Critical situations can happen during delivery. 
“You need to get to a hospital in a pretty short span of time in order to have the baby and mom still be viable, still actually surviving and being not just the baby living in the NICU,” said Maya Dunson, a second-year medical student at Ohio State University.
Those long distances can sometimes prohibit patients from getting prenatal care.
“I have a lot of patients that share a car with their partner, and they can’t always drive the 30 to 45 minutes or afford the gas money to come see us for adequate prenatal care, which obviously affects not only the mom, but the baby at that point,” Martter said. 
Despite the challenges, she enjoys practicing in a smaller town. 
“There’s something to be said about a small town … and knowing that when you go to the grocery store, you’re going to potentially see multiple patients that you’ve delivered,” she said. “I take care of entire generations of families.”
Nationally, there were 38 practicing OB-GYNs per 100,000 women in the United States and nearly half of the nation’s counties had no OB-GYNs in 2021-22, according to KFF’s data. Nearly 80% of rural counties had no OB-GYNs, according to KFF. 
“The biggest issue is obviously access,” said Ohio state Rep. Anita Somani, D-Dublin. “What happens is people don’t get care.”
Telehealth appointments increased in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the lack of bandwidth in rural areas can get in the way of telehealth appointments.
“They have dial up and so you can’t really have adequate visits with them,” Martter said.
Ohio has 13 counties that are maternity care deserts — meaning they lack hospitals with obstetric care, birth centers and obstetric providers like OB-GYNs, according to the March of Dimes.
“If you’re in one of those areas, you’re traveling anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to get care,” said Somani, who has been an OB-GYN for more than 30 years and works in Columbus. “It’s going to take a long time to rebuild and improve maternity deserts.”
The 13 counties that are maternity care deserts are Belmont County, Carroll County, Champaign County, Fayette County, Hardin County, Jackson County, Meigs County, Monroe County, Morrow County, Noble County, Perry County, Putnam County, and Vinton County. 
“The situation is only getting worse,” said Maya Neidhart, a second-year medical student at Ohio State. “There are still patients in those areas that need access to prenatal care. … Minutes do make the difference.”
Neidhart is from Meigs County and hopes to return to southeast Ohio after graduating to practice as an OB-GYN.
“It has always been my goal to be able to return to the community I’m from and serve it, but it really just depends on if I feel safe to practice in the state,” Neidhart said. “Not having access to abortion care also leads to poor maternal mortality outcomes when people terminate pregnancies in unsafe ways.”
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. Ohio voters passed a ballot measure in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.
Ohio has six surgical abortion clinics located in Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Bedford Heights, Cuyahoga Falls, and Dayton. Toledo’s abortion clinic switched to just a medication abortion facility in 2019.
The state had 45 abortion clinics in 1992, Somani said. 
“There’s been just a huge decrease in a lot of those clinics,” Somani said. “The bigger problem is, when you restrict abortion, you can’t train the next generation to be able to do the care that they need to.”
Dunson and Neidhart are both members of Medical Students for Choice, an international advocacy organization focused on educating medical students about reproductive health care, including abortion. They have more than 300 chapters on medical school campuses. 
“Med Students for Choice is there to make sure that medical students get the training that they need to become abortion care providers,” Neidhart said. (Abortion is) part of full spectrum obstetric and gynecology care, so it’s absolutely something that it is health care, and it’s needs to be part of the conversation when we’re talking about access to reproductive health care.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)In June 2024, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump charged on his social media platform that “much of Higher Education has lost its way, and is now corrupting our Youth and Society with, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology.” He vowed to remove such “wokeness” from U.S. education.
Trump has primarily targeted elite private universities in his attacks on higher education, but Kansas state universities may not escape collateral damage. For example, Kansas State University, not known to be a hotbed of “socialist and anti-American ideology,” has taken on more than its fair share of flak.
A bit of history is in order.
Upon his first day in office this past January, Trump took his first stab at terminating “wokeness” in education. He declared by executive order that the words “diversity, equity, and inclusion” were “illegal and immoral” in their application throughout the federal government, including in grants and contracts with colleges and universities. He ordered the threatening words and related practices to be banned.
A few weeks later, the national office of Young America’s Foundation filed a detailed civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, asserting: “On behalf of our YAF members at Kansas State University and all truth-seeking students on that campus, YAF requests that you open a formal investigation into Kansas State for its promotion of DEI, racialism, and gender ideology in violation of the First Amendment, civil rights laws, and President Trump’s executive orders.”
YAF, likely an organization most Kansans have never heard of, promotes itself as “the leading organization for young conservatives” and has an active chapter on the K-State campus.
In the meantime, Kansas Republican state lawmakers were considering how Trump’s demands could be applied to higher education in Kansas. They finally settled on attaching a directive to an omnibus appropriation bill with financial penalties for state universities that failed to:

Eliminate any positions that relate to DEI.
Eliminate any mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities relating to DEI.
Eliminate any training requirements in DEI for any employee.
Cancel any state grants or contracts relating to DEI.

For good measure, state lawmakers also outlawed gender-identifying pronouns or gender ideology in email signature blocks on state email accounts and any other form of communication.
The Kansas Board of Regents provided guidance to state universities on the matter, and the universities, including K-State, dutifully complied. The forbidden words were scrubbed from their websites, program descriptions, and personnel. In some cases, potentially offending units were eliminated or consolidated, or rebranded to avoid being a target.
For the conservative students at K-State, this cleansing had not gone far enough. The K-State chapter of YAF claimed the university’s actions were a “shell game,” and there was “much work to do.”
Then, in early September, former Gov. Jeff Colyer, now a gubernatorial candidate, saw an opportunity to score political points with Trump’s MAGA base by calling for the firing of a “far-left extremist” on K-State’s staff. Colyer issued a formal campaign statement, asserting: “Kansas State University has made a serious mistake hiring far-left extremist Derron Borders into its Office of Civil Rights.” According to press reports, K-State suspended Borders.
Next, days after the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Colyer found another opportunity to target K-State. He posted on social media a video in which Kirk called out K-State as “the worst” university in the country for infringing his free speech. The video reminded followers of an incident one year earlier in which university officials had cut Kirk’s microphone during his “You’re Being Brainwashed Tour” to the campus. In fact, Kirk had arrived late and spoke for an hour but had exceeded university time limits for blasting loud speakers in the student plaza during class time.
Colyer promised that if he were elected governor, students at state universities would be protected from “woke overlords” that seek to silence them.
Then, a couple weeks ago, state Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi claimed that state lawmakers were hearing complaints from parents of K-State students. According to Blasi, “some of the universities are rebranding these programs to do the same things that the Legislature has explicitly prohibited.” State lawmakers are now investigating course syllabi in selected academic units at K-State and other universities.
Does the banning of forbidden words mean that our state universities will now be committed to becoming less diverse, less equitable, and less inclusive? I doubt that. I doubt further that most Kansans want state universities characterized by homogeneity, inequity, and exclusiveness. Our state universities have long histories as powerful equalizing forces in American life, and I expect that to continue.
With experience as a student, alum, faculty member, and administrator at three state universities in Kansas over a period of 50 years, I do not believe one would find much “wokeness” in our state universities. Nor are those universities corrupting students with socialism, nor with anti-American ideas, nor with left-wing or right-wing ideologies.
K-State’s experience this past year provides a cautionary tale for all state universities in this Trump era. I forewarn my faculty colleagues that they are ripe targets for agents near and far if they wander outside their respective disciplines into this political quagmire. University officials should remain agile, diffuse incidents that arise, and protect their faculty and staff. And the Kansas Board of Regents should continue its strong defense of academic freedom.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Every Thanksgiving there is a brief (underscored) kumbaya moment in my household before everyone digs into the traditional spread. We join hands to acknowledge the benevolence and beseech the blessings of the Almighty. 
In recent years, I started tacking on an addendum to our prayer, a petition for divine intervention to save the country we love. 
Sure, my one-more-thing entreaty has irked some in the motley crew gathered, but it has become ever more pertinent as America stares into the abyss. 
Even the most apathetic among us know something is deeply wrong in the nation we pledge allegiance to from an early age. 
People are noticeably on edge, worried, broke. 
Sticker shock at the grocery store has blown a gaping hole in monthly budgets. Rent increases are ridiculous. Electric bills have spiked. 
Paychecks do not keep up with inflation. Wages are down for Ohio’s most common occupations.  
It is impossible for many to get ahead in a state that ranks 18th in the country for financial hardship. 
To make things worse, Trump’s erratic tariffs are raising prices for Ohio consumers and businesses. 
Commerce has slowed. The labor market has softened. Company layoffs surged to a two-decade high in October across the country. 
Pessimism is only growing about the state of the economy. Agriculture, Ohio’s largest industry, has been bankrupted by the trade war Trump started. 
It has left Ohio farmers, who depend on foreign market demand, in the red.  
The promised “golden age” from the convicted felon rings hollow for family farms going under. 
It also rings hollow for low-income MAGA faithful left adrift with shredded safety nets after food stamp and Medicaid funding was slashed by hundreds of billions to offset trillions in Trump tax cuts to the ultra-rich.

Working class Trump supporters, who augment their meager take-home pay with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy groceries, got a rude awakening recently when their hero callously let SNAP benefits lapse for the first time in the program’s history. 
Food aid for the poorest Ohioans was delayed in the longest government shutdown on the books while the Republican-controlled U.S. House left town, the Republican-controlled  Senate killed time, and the Republican president preoccupied himself with destroying the East Wing of the White House to build a glitzy ballroom as families went hungry. 
Trump fixated on his marble remake of the bathroom off the Lincoln bedroom as more than half a million Ohioans feared being priced out of affordable health insurance if cost-saving subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans were not extended. 
But Trump wants to scrap Obamacare altogether and Republican majorities in Congress prefer padding the portfolios of the wealthy to helping constituents who could lose health coverage when the ACA subsidies expire at the end of December. 
Meanwhile, when the convicted felon isn’t consumed with garish vanity projects and pocketing $1.8 billion in cash and gifts since his 2024 reelection, he is bent on militarizing U.S. cities with boots on the ground. 
Ohio National Guard troops, deployed on nebulous grounds to Washington D.C. in August by a spineless governor, have (inexplicably) had their landscaping and trash removal deployment extended by Mike DeWine until the end of February. 
Simultaneously, Trump is presiding over aide Stephen Miller’s unspeakably cruel (and unconstitutional) campaign to brutally terrorize largely law-abiding undocumented and documented citizens with masked goons operating without constraint (or warrants) as the regime’s secret, unaccountable police on a mission to fill deportation quotas with brown people who speak Spanish.
As a child sex-trafficking scandal involving Trump’s longtime wingman inches closer to the adjudicated sexual abuser dozing behind the Resolute desk, Trump is throwing whatever distraction sticks to the wall. 
He’s siccing the Justice Department on political opponents, calling for the execution of congressional Democrats, conducting extrajudicial killings of alleged drug smugglers with blown up fishing boats in the Caribbean, threatening an unprovoked attack on a sovereign country (Venezuela) with a massive military build-up off its coast, and rewarding Russia for invading Ukraine.
It’s a lot. 
Trump and his sinister Project 2025 architects are moving with all deliberate speed to establish tyrannical rule in America 250 years after Americans fought to the death for freedom from absolute power. 
They fortified themselves with the armor of inalienable rights that were non-negotiable. 
It was a lot. World-changing. But somehow, enough colonists summoned the courage of their convictions to live free and wrested independence from a despotic monarchy. 
They risked much to secure “the Blessings of Liberty” for themselves and their posterity. Until now.
This imperfect union, founded on the intrinsic worth of every human being and rooted in ideals from self-determination to equal protection under the law is hanging by a thread in 2025. 
But somehow, those lucky enough to inherit what past generations died to preserve have summoned the courage to push back, to mass protest, to litigate injustice, to hold power to account, to resign on principle, to decry vindictive prosecutions, sadistic ICE indignities, denied due process, threats against judges, election workers, the press. 
They often risk much to stand up. But their fearlessness inspires others to follow and secure “the Blessings of Liberty” for Americans not yet born. 
At least that’s what I pray for this Thanksgiving and always.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-26 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Academic freedom should extend to UConn graduate assistants,Robert T.F. Downes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/26/academic-freedom-should-extend-to-uconn-graduate-assistants/,"Graduate assistants following UConn’s values by speaking clearly, honestly, and frankly in class or as a private citizen deserve the same protection as any full professor.","The University of Connecticut, the state’s flagship public university, prides itself on its R1 research status — a status built heavily on the commitments, contributions, and labor of graduate student employees (also known as Graduate Assistants, or ‘GAs’). 
Currently, GAs are fighting to protect academic freedom in their workplace, as the Graduate Employee Union (GEU-UAW) continues bargaining its contract with the university.
In labs and classrooms, graduate student employees teach undergraduates, run experiments, conduct surveys, and generate much of the scholarship credited to UConn. They are not casual “students” on the sidelines living by the motto of “C’s get degrees.” They are employees who keep UConn’s research and teaching enterprise running. As dedicated researchers, curious scholars, and paid employees, GAs perform essential research, writing, and teaching labor that faculty, given other commitments and time constraints, cannot shoulder on their own.
Although UConn’s Graduate School does not yet have its own academic freedom policy, the UConn Law School approved its own Policy on Employee Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression in May 2025. The law school’s academic freedom policy makes clear that protections apply to every law school employee, “without regard to their status” — i.e., tenured or adjunct, student-worker or professor. Indeed, the law school’s policy explicitly extends to student-workers in their capacity as employees. The policy states that, to serve its “mission,” the law school “should not insulate students from ideas because they may find them controversial, offensive, or disagreeable.”
On the basis of this policy alone — one that resembles the very same language proposed by the GEU-UAW, and one that has been approved within the very same university — it makes no sense for the university to deny graduate student employees either the same freedom to teach and discover that it grants to full professors or the same protections that it affords a select group of student-workers in the law school.
In effect, the GEU’s proposed Article XX on academic freedom would write into the existing contract what the law school’s policy — and both the U.S. Constitution and state law — already imply. That is, graduate student researchers and instructors deserve the same freedom in teaching and research as anyone else on campus. Crucially, for graduate student employees, academic freedom is not merely an intellectual value — it is a workplace protection that ensures research and teaching are governed by scholarly judgment rather than managerial preference.
Academic freedom in the classroom and in the law
Academic freedom means that students, professors, instructors, and researchers can pursue and discuss ideas freely and in the open — even controversial ideas. High courts have long held that students enjoy this right. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court famously ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) that students may wear anti-war armbands because “[i]t can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”
By the same token, a UConn graduate assistant, professor, or student should be able to investigate or speak up about any relevant topic in class or research. As both John Stuart Mill’s ‘Harm Principle’ and decades of free speech case law make clear, limits on open thought and discussion in a democratic society should kick in only when the speech in question threatens a material disruption to the educational environment, or incites violence and causes direct harm.
What this means in a democracy is that speech, expression, and inquiry cannot be curtailed because they might merely provoke discomfort or disagreement. As Justice Fortas wrote for the Court in Tinker, “Any variation from the majority’s opinion may inspire fear. Any word spoken, in class, in the lunchroom, or on the campus, that deviates from the views of another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance.” Nonetheless, this potential for contention does not constitute grounds for suppression.
We can (and universities have) set reasonable rules, such as requiring classes to end on time or banning in-class interruptions. However, another important point emerges: any restriction must be viewpoint-neutral. In constitutional terms, “time, place, and manner” regulations on political speech must be content-neutral and narrowly tailored. The law school’s policy reflects these constitutional principles, making a public commitment to “protecting the rights [of employees] as provided by law.”
Beyond the U.S. Constitution, the law school’s academic freedom policy notes its compliance with Article 1 Section 4 of the Connecticut Constitution: “Every citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.” It also cites Connecticut General Statute Section 31-51g,[6] which both protects employees from retaliation for exercising their federal and state constitutional rights to free speech. It further notes that its rules comply with articles XIV and XV of UConn’s by-laws, which contain the university’s provisions on “academic freedom for faculty and professional staff” and “the expression of dissent” (as described in the law school’s policy).
Academic freedom: a policy and a principle
The Graduate Employees Union’s proposed Article XX on academic freedom would write into the contract what UConn’s mission already implies: that every scholar can teach, research, and speak freely. The GEUs proposed language states that GAs may “present and discuss all relevant matters in and beyond the classroom” and “speak or write without any censorship, threat, restraint, or discipline by the University” in the performance of their duties. It similarly affirms GAs’ right to openly express themselves on any issue, including university policy or governance.
What does this mean? It means, per the proposed language in Article XX, that graduate instructors could cover any course-relevant topic or pursue any line of research without fear that unpopular conclusions will lead to lost funding. Instead, controversial questions would be fair game for study and debate. Graduate students could write articles, testify in public forums, or post on social media about social or political issues without fear of retaliation by the institution.
In a serious R1, scholars should not worry that open-ended inquiry will jeopardize their degrees or appointments. As Albert Einstein said, “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence… Never lose a holy curiosity.” Indeed, as one learns from the famous philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, science is supposed to be disruptive, perhaps even revolutionary.
The UConn Law School’s academic freedom policy evidently echoes this sentiment in its commitment that the university “should not insulate students from ideas because they may find them controversial, offensive, or disagreeable.” But it is not enough for these principles to sit on paper. They need clear, enforceable language in our agreements and in our relationships so that existing policies carry real weight in practice.
So where do we go from here? The answer: “shared governance.” This is the answer put forward in a CT Mirror op-ed authored by Political Science Professors Jeffrey Dudas and Jeremy Pressman. Dr. Dudas is the current president of UConn’s American Association of University Professors (AAUP) chapter, while Dr. Pressman serves on the chapter’s executive committee.
GAs are not asking for much in the proposed language of Article XX. They are simply asking to be met and heard in good faith during this bargaining process and in future negotiations. These are not radical demands; they restate the core principles of academic freedom, open discussion, and transparency in public institutions. UConn’s own by-laws, state law, and the First Amendment already underwrite these guarantees. Writing them into the union contract would affirm that UConn genuinely values free inquiry at every level of the university.
Upholding UConn’s public mission
Academic freedom, open debate and discussion, access to information, and spaces for contestation and experimentation are not luxuries. They are the vital organs of higher education, if not of democratic society at large. A public university that disciplines scholars for inconvenient truths or compels instructors to sanitize their syllabi abandons its fundamental commitments to dialogue, learning, and the common good.
UConn’s reputation depends on independence from partisan influence, a willingness to innovate by taking intellectual risks, and a steadfast commitment to truth even when it is uncomfortable. Attempting to polish its image or placate critics through brand management is, as a philosopher might say, a preoccupation with form over substance. Put differently, no amount of messaging, fed hand-to-mouth from consultants to administrators, can ever substitute for the real work of protecting free inquiry, open discussion, and the people who carry them out.
GAs following UConn’s values by speaking clearly, honestly, and frankly in class or as a private citizen deserve the same protection as any full professor. For example, a teaching assistant in an American politics course should not fear discipline for answering a student’s question about gerrymandering, immigration policy, or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the best of their knowledge and ability. When even one instructor — from a senior professor to a first-year TA — is chilled or pushed out for doing their job, the intellectual life of the entire campus diminishes. And when such pressures accumulate, the prognosis is clear: the fall of academic freedom leads to an intellectual anemia that weakens the entire institution.
If UConn truly values its position as the state’s flagship public research university and its central role in shaping Connecticut’s future professionals and leaders, then it must do more than count publications or measure productivity by the spreadsheet. As Professors Jeffrey Dudas and Jeremy Pressman remind readers, the university must begin listening to the academic departments, faculty, and student-employees, who are “the beating hearts of the UConn community.” That means supporting fair pay, due process, and unequivocal academic freedom for graduate employees. Graduate employees are not asking for perks. They are asking for parity with existing university policy and with the values UConn professes publicly.
At the end of the day, defending academic freedom is defending democracy. UConn must be a marketplace of ideas, not a walled garden for the ivory tower. Granting GAs the protections in Article XX is not a labor concession. It reaffirms, as Justice Oliver Wendall Holmes said, that “the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas.” That is a lesson worth teaching every student.

The Prince George’s County Democratic Central Committee chose Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) on Tuesday night to fill the District 47 Senate seat vacated this month by Michael Jackson, who is now the State Police superintendent.
Tbe Democratic Central Committee in neighboring Charles County also selected Harris last Saturday. The Calvert County Democratic Central Committee is still set to meet Saturday for the seat, which includes parts of all three counties, but with two counties already in Harris’ corner, Calvert cannot change the outcome.
Once a majority of county central committees have decided on a candidate, that one name needs to be forwarded to the governor’s office, according to an Oct. 21 letter from Attorney General’s office that summarized the process.
Of the 26 Prince George’s committee members, 16 chose Harris and the remaining 10 nominated Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Calvert and Prince George’s). Attorney Jason Fowler of Calvert County received no votes Tuesday.

“We have three great candidates. Greatly appreciate all the people who came out in the rain,” Harris said after the vote. “Always remember we’re still one community … [and] still going to work together as one team, no matter what.”
Harris had two major supporters who spoke on his behalf: Jackson, the former senator, and Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D).
“I know that we need a leader who can be effective in Annapolis, and I know that Del. Harris is that leader,” Braveboy said. “He’s a good person. He’s a great leader, and he knows how to bring people together.”
Tuesday’s more than one-hour public hearing in Prince George’s included a break while the committee checked on whether Fowler’s paperwork had been received on time. It had and he was able to participate.
All three candidates answered eight questions that included opinions on data centers, strategies to help Marylanders who lost their jobs and benefits due to Trump administration policies and how would they balance the needs of a district with three counties that each govern differently. The candidates were interviewed one at a time while the other two were out of the room, so they could not hear each other’s answers.
All three said they would support continued funding for the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
In terms of immediate priorities, each candidate offered a different answer.
Fowler, who has experience in tax law, said he would figure out how to decrease a nearly $1.5 billion deficit state lawmakers are expected to face in next year’s budget.

“How do we derive tax revenue, and how do we do it the most efficient way?” he asked. “That’s some experience that I can bring to the table, and I believe that that’s what we need.”
Harris said he would continue to focus on education and economic development. He highlighted his work on the state’s Promise Scholarship, which is for eligible high school graduates, or those who earned a GED, to attend a community college.
“I believe when folks get certifications, they can actually get in the workforce on day one,” he said. “You still go back and finish your degree, or at least you have in some cases, a full-time job [and] be able to support your family and still go to school.”
Long said he would work to unite the entire legislative district, and to secure investment in rapid transit for Southern Maryland. He also said he would work to diversify “our income tax base to ensure that we can give our seniors that break that they so rightfully deserve.”
Once Gov. Wes Moore (D) receives a nominee’s name, he has up to 15 days to officially appoint him to represent District 27 in the state Senate.
With Harris appearing to get the nomination, his District 27A House seat, which represents parts of Prince George’s and Charles counties, would become vacant.  That means the Democratic Central Committees in those counties will need to meet again soon to nominate someone to fill Harris’ District 27A seat.
The General Assembly convenes for next year’s 90-day session Jan. 14.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore’s new district court building has been open since last month, but a ribbon-cutting Tuesday was for more than just the building – it was to mark its new name, for the first Black woman to ever serve on any bench in the Maryland.
State officials and family members were on hand to rename district courthouse to honor the legacy of the late Judge Mabel Houze Hubbard. John Hubbard, son of the trailblazing judge, said he was “elated” that his mother’s memory and legacy would be honored with the building’s name change.
“She wanted everybody to have a fair chance and to really feel like they were heard,” he said. “I think people really remembered her and she stuck with people because of the way she made them feel … I can understand why people really, really appreciated her.”
The new courthouse, located at 500 Calvert Street, opened for public use in mid-October. After a push from district court judges to have it named after Hubbard and her legacy, state officials approved the name change later that month.
A newly opened district courthouse in Baltimore was renamed to Mabel H. Hubbard District Courthouse, honoring the first Black woman to be appointed to any bench in Maryland
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), on hand for Tuesday’s ribbon-cutting event, said the new courthouse represents a “safer, modern, more accessible system of justice for Baltimore.”
“The fight for justice … takes on an even deeper meaning when people who were once denied access to justice, equality and opportunity rise to the highest levels of the system itself – as Judge Mabel H. Hubbard did,” Miller said.
“She was a barrier breaker and a history maker … at a time when people who looked like her walked into courtrooms only to be told, in ways spoken and unspoken, that they didn’t belong,” Miller said.
Born in Detroit in 1936, Hubbard first worked as an English teacher and administrator in Pennsylvania before receiving her Juris Doctorate degree at the University of Maryland School of Law in 1975, according to state documents.
In 1978, she was appointed as a master-in-chancery for the Supreme Bench for Baltimore City, what is now called the Baltimore City Circuit Court, marking her as the first Black woman to be appointed to a bench in Maryland.
District Court Administrative Judge Geoffrey Hengerer said that Hubbard brought “style and perspective” to District 1, donning bright red lipstick and bright red glasses and using humorous turns-of-phrase in the courtroom that became known as “Hubbard-isms.”
“But ultimately, Judge Hubbard had a calm, deliberate demeanor that resonated,” Hengerer said at the ribbon-cutting.
In her career, Hubbard served on both the District Court and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, retiring from the latter in 1999. During that time, she was also known for mentoring other Black woman attorneys.

The new five-story 168,000-square-foot courthouse houses eight courtrooms, a detention area and multiple state and local agencies, among other features.
General Services Secretary Atif Chaudhry said the facility was a “huge achievement” for the state in both construction and in adhering to energy and carbon neutrality goals.
“We accomplished something really remarkable here in this facility, without acquiring additional land or disturbing the surrounding community,” Chaudhry said. “We took an old state building which was at the end of its useful life … and pulled it back to its steel frame. We then built it back up stronger, safer. More efficient and more accessible.”
The facility’s name change was approved by the Board of Public Works in October, when the facility was only known as the New Baltimore City District Court.
During that meeting, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said the name change would honor Hubbard’s “service … her leadership, and her commitment to the people that that court will serve for generations to come.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_november25_hubbardcourt_ribboncutting_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 03:56:54.161759

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)It’s the not-so-giving season for a group of climate advocates who are losing faith with the Moore administration’s promises to promote clean-energy policies, and they demonstrated their displeasure Tuesday by sending Gov. Wes Moore a “Thanks … for nothing” card.
“We were thinking about what we wanted to thank this governor for,” said Jorge Aguilar with the group Food and Water Watch, as he held the snarky greeting card outside the Department of the Environment in Baltimore. “Our membership could not think of many things, because we think he has not delivered on many of his promises.”
Aguilar and 10 other advocates walked over from a nearby park with the large card in hand to deliver it to the environment department, where they were greeted by the department’s chief of staff, Scott Goldman.
Aguilar handed Goldman the card, walking him through the group’s many criticisms of the Moore administration. Those concerns largely centered around what the advocates see as a lack of follow-through on Moore’s energy platform that he campaigned on. They also worry Moore has backed policies that actively backtrack on clean-energy efforts.
Advocates with Food and Water Watch gathered in Carroll Park before walking over to the Department of the Environment. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“He signed the Next Generation Energy Act, which is going to promote new gas plants and new power plans,” Aguilar told Goldman. “This is after he promised to reach 100% clean energy by 2035. Instead, we’re going in a different direction.”
Aguilar said Moore has been “promoting data centers” which will “demand a lot of energy and a lot of water” at the expense of Maryland residents. He also pointed to the governor’s veto of a bill that would have studied the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland.
“So our hope is that in 2026, the administration rights these wrongs and does better for Maryland,” Aguilar said. “We’re here really to deliver the message that we’re pretty upset.”
Aguilar said there’s “a lot of good stuff” happening at the department, but the advocates lay the blame on Moore for “not showing leadership” in his climate policies.
Goldman respectfully listened to the group’s concerns and accepted the card.
“I will take this in, and thank you for doing all this, being out in the rain,” Goldman told the advocates. “I know we all want the same thing, I know the governor does as well.”
The Other Kevin Anderson
Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday tapped Kevin Anderson to be the new delegate from Lower Shore District 38A.
For those scratching their heads about now, we’re not talking about the Kevin Anderson who served as Maryland secretary of Commerce until January and still works in the administration. This is Howard “Kevin” Anderson, a Somerset County Republican who is the third generation to run the family farm and seed business.
Anderson fills the seat left empty by the sudden death last month of Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) who had just filed to seek election to a fifth term when he died.

Anderson was one of five candidates from the district, which includes Somerset County, southern Worcester County and a bit of Wicomico County south of Salisbury. He was chosen by the three counties’ Republican Central Committees earlier this month and forwarded to Moore.
In making the announcement, Moore called Anderson “a son of the Eastern Shore, with deep roots in Somerset County and a lifelong commitment to growing Maryland’s agricultural sector.”
“He understands the needs of his community firsthand, and I am confident that he will serve his constituents with dedication and distinction,” Moore said in a statement. “I look forward to working in partnership with Kevin to build a Maryland that leaves no one behind.”
Anderson owns and operates Wimberly Farms in Somerset County, growing corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley together with his father, wife, and two daughters, according to the announcement from the governor’s office. It said Anderson and his father also operate a seed conditioning facility where they clean, treat and bag soybean, wheat, and barley seeds, the third generation to do so.
He earned the National Young Farmer Achievement Award in 2002 from the American Farm Bureau Federation, and was named a National Outstanding Young Farmer by the Outstanding Farmers of America in 2007.
Anderson sits on the Maryland Grain Producers board of directors, and serves as vice president of the Maryland Crop Association, in addition to serving on various statewide boards, local civic clubs, and organizations to promote the seed industry.

Braveboy names Okoye to planning board
Prince George’s County businessman Billy Okoye was sworn in last week as the newest member of the Prince George’s County Planning Board of The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, succeeding Dorothy Bailey, the former vice chair of the board.
Okoye, who was appointed by County Executive Aisha Braveboy and confirmed by the County Council, joined his first board meeting last week.
“His experience in business, community advocacy, real estate, and technology will offer a new dynamic to our forward-thinking Planning Board and award-winning agency,” said Prince George’s County Planning Board Chairman Darryl Barnes.
Okoye, who has real estate broker’s licenses in Maryland and the District of Columbia, was founder and principal broker of Sold 100 Real Estate Inc., according to a planning board press release, as well as group managing director of BMO General Contractors. He serves as chairman of the United African Advisory Board which works to strengthen community engagement and representation under Braveboy’s office.
“My professional journey has given me a practical ground-level understanding of our County’s vision for growth as outlined in the 2035 plan – the guiding framework for sustainable and equitable development across communities,” Okoye said in a statement. “I look forward to our collaborative work to revitalize the inner-Beltway neighborhoods into vibrant, transit-oriented economic hubs that attract jobs and opportunities.”
The five-member Prince George’s County Planning Board oversees planning and zoning in the county, as well as administering the county’s public recreation program. Together with the Montgomery County Planning Board, the two bodies operate as the Maryland-National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, which oversees land use, planning, zoning, and parks and recreation in the suburban Washington counties.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)As he argued in Baltimore’s federal courthouse Tuesday, attorney Harris Eisenstein pulled a bright orange hunting vest from his bag and hoisted it into the air.
“This is all that it takes,” he said.
If power line surveyors from PSEG Renewable Transmission simply don the fluorescent orange and pink that hunters are well accustomed to, they won’t face any real danger completing environmental inspections in rural Maryland during hunting season, Eisenstein said.
PSEG, the company behind the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, a 67-mile transmission line planned through Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, doesn’t think it’s quite so simple.
Surveyors for the proposed line could be crouched in the underbrush, rummaging about, making them difficult for hunters to see, even if they wore bright colors, said Kurt Fischer, an attorney representing PSEG.
The company is asking U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson to prevent landowners from hunting, or allowing hunting, on their property on any days when PSEG has indicated that it plans to come and survey — unless they contact the power company to request permission.
The landowners, who number in the hundreds, oppose any court-ordered hunting ban, “even for a minute,” Eisenstein said.
“They are creating a recipe for a tragedy,” Fischer said.
Abelson declined to rule immediately after Tuesday’s hearing, but acknowledged arguments on both sides: The surveyors have a right to enter private property to conduct their inspections, as required by the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, he said, but landowners have a right to hunt on their own land during the proper season.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

“What we have are competing rights,” Abelson said Tuesday. “I’m trying to put these competing rights together and find a reasonable solution.”
Attorneys representing several hundred landowners proposed that PSEG give 72 hours notice of survey activities during any Maryland hunting season, and provide specific details about their activities so hunters can prepare for their arrival. That, in addition to requiring that surveyors wear the bright-colored gear.
The two sides were in the same courtroom in May, when the power company and the landowners sparred over whether the court could require property owners to allow the surveys over their objections.
Abelson concluded in June that PSEG has the authority to complete the surveys, which will ultimately inform the Maryland Public Service Commission’s decision whether or not to allow construction on the power line to begin. The landowners have appealed his ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
On Tuesday, Abelson gave PSEG that same authority over a third group of landowners, over protests from their attorneys, who said new information has emerged since Abelson’s June ruling, calling into question the urgency of the power company’s requests for land access.
Namely, the PSC issued a procedural schedule in September saying it will not make a final decision on the power line until February 2027, at the earliest. PSEG had said it needed surveying authority to meet a deadline from power system regulators to have the line in service by June 1, 2027.
“Their … application is stuck in the mud no matter what happens in this case,” Eisenstein said.
Despite the new PSC schedule, power company attorney Emily Wilson said time “very much remains of the essence here,” citing a letter from regional electric grid operator PJM Interconnection that calls for the line to be placed in service as soon as possible to avoid possibile grid failures.
Review for Piedmont power line will take until at least February 2027, Maryland regulators say

Eisenstein also argued that PSEG will need to conduct geotechnical boring surveys, but Maryland law does not allow it to compel that more invasive surveying, making it unlikely the company can meet its obligations.
Wilson argued that the Maryland Power Plant Research Program could determine that the geotechnical surveys are not necessary. Whether they are or not, it doesn’t change the fact that state law is on PSEG’s side with regard to property access, she said.
“What this case is focused on is the land access,” she said. “They do not have a right to exclude the company in this way.”
David Wyand, another attorney for the landowners, argued that the legislature only gave eminent domain powers to companies that have already been granted permission to construct their line. Technically, a state government entity, such as the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, could conduct the surveys, Wyand said, but PSEG can’t — as a private company.
“The General Assembly has specifically not said that PSEG has that right,” Wyand said.
But Abelson said that none of the new information changed his mind that PSEG should be able to collect its survey data, unimpeded by the landowners who disagree.
It’s unclear whether landowners will sway Abelson on the hunting issue, which they argue is urgent. Maryand’s firearm season for white-tailed deer, for instance, begins Saturday, and runs until Dec. 13.
Matt Moran, an Adamstown landowner in the path of the power line, said after Tuesday’s hearing that he recently received a notice from PSEG advising him that it plans to survey in the weeks ahead. If Abelson rules that landowners cannot hunt on any day when PSEG might  survey, Moran said he would only have one day open to hunt.










They are out-of-state. And they are out of touch.


– Harris Eisenstein, attorney for Maryland landowners, of New Jersey-based PSEG


“That leaves me with one day to go out and get the venison that I need to feed my family, because I rely on venison to feed my family,” Moran said. “If you look in the freezer at my home, you’ll see that there’s more venison than there is beef, pork, chicken and fish combined.”
Attorneys for the landowners argued that hunting is not just a valued pastime for many rural Marylanders, but a relied-upon method for gathering food and reducing the number of animals that eat their crops.
“They are out-of-state,” Eisenstein said of New Jersey-based PSEG. “And they are out of touch.”
Eisenstein said PSEG’s practice of sending one notice to warn landowners about “multiple weeks” of surveying, even though actual surveys may only occur on particular days, “cloud” landowners’ lives. PSEG’s proposed hunting order could restrict the activity for weeks at a time, infringing on hunters’ rights, Eisenstein said.
PSEG’s attorneys argued that the company routinely coordinates with landowners who call with concerns about specific days, and that the company would “ideally” be able to come to agreement with landowners regarding hunting days.
But not all landowners are willing to work with PSEG. Some will not even correspond with the company, Wilson said. On at least one occasion, a landowner referenced hunting season in a Facebook post that PSEG perceived as a threat.

“We need that protection in place to protect our surveyors and their assistants,” Wilson said, “so that a really unfortunate accident does not occur.”
Wilson argued that Abelson needs to universally bar hunting during the survey work, and allow exceptions for particular properties. Eisenstein countered that hunting bans should be the exception — not the rule.
Nancy Gardetto, owner of Copper Penny Farm in Adamstown, said she, her husband and their two children are eagerly awaiting Saturday’s opening of deer season, which they also use to stock their freezers with venison, and cut down on the deer population to protect crops.
Gardetto also got a surveying notice from PSEG overlapping with the weeks of the hunt. She said she called PSEG to advise the company that it should not survey her property during that period because there would be hunting, and she feels the company should oblige. She made sure to emphasize that she was not making a threat, she said.
“They claim to have great coordination with all the property owners,” Gardetto said. “If that’s the case, I don’t understand why we need to ask permission to hunt our own farmland. I don’t understand why they can’t contact us and say: ‘Hey, we’ve got guys coming out tomorrow. Is anybody going to be there hunting?’”
“I don’t know why we had to be dragged into court to be forced into this,” Gardetto said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9664-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 22:56:40.832612

In a time of limited resources and inequitable access, maybe we should try, writes Kalman Hettleman. But he also says that, despite challenges, now is not the time to abandon GTE, but to reform it.","Gifted and talented education is essential, but also divisive, writes Kalman Hettleman, who says the programs need to be reformed in the name of equity and resource allocation. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)What could be wrong with public schools providing instruction tailored to fulfill the potential of “gifted and talented” students (GTE)? Our nation has a vital interest in gifted and talented citizens and workers.
The National Association for Gifted Children states that education for gifted and talented students must move students “at an educational pace matching their abilities and readiness for advanced curriculum rather than restricting them to a set of grade-level standards based on their age.”
That’s the persuasive case for more GTE. Nonetheless, the New York Times reports that GTE is “one of the most volatile issues in public education.” A leading analyst finds that “there is no issue in American education that is more fraught.”
Why is GTE so controversial? Why, despite strong support from parents and vigorous national and state advocacy movements, is progress lagging?
There are two huge obstacles. One is cost. The second is even more fundamental: It’s widespread criticism that GTE is inequitable and elitist; only a small percentage of students found eligible are Black, Latino or poor.
That makes it a political hot potato. Identification is pivotal, and requirements are being revised to replace subjective parent and teacher referrals with, as stated in Maryland’s model, “universal screening … and multiple indicators of potential.”

One dilemma is finding the right age for identification. A recent journal article concludes that giftedness is mobile: It can be influenced by nature or nurture. Policies vary. Maryland requires identification “as early as possible, but no later than Grade 3.”
Beyond identification, the lack of earmarked federal and state funds for GTE is a major barrier. The uncomfortable policy question is: Given very scarce funding for public schools, what priority should GTE get?
When I was a member of the Baltimore City school board in the early 2000s, there was an 8-1 vote to reallocate funds to gifted and talented students. I was the lone dissenter. I reasoned that – because city schools were extraordinarily underfunded and the overwhelming majority of students, predominantly Black and poor, weren’t coming close to meeting reading and math standards, we couldn’t afford the reallocation.
I think back on my vote uneasily. Highest priorities can’t be exclusive priorities. A balance must be struck between extra instruction for low-performing students and other valuable school programs, from art and music to career and technical education to GTE, and so on.
The leading national proponent of GTE is the Fordham Institute education think tank. Its president, Michael Petrilli (a policy star), has written  “How can we depolarize ‘gifted education’?” He points out the U.S. not only trails other countries in basic reading and math proficiency; we are far behind in “advanced” achievement. And his chief recommendations parallel the Maryland model.
But what’s actually happening on the ground? Data is limited but each local district does pretty much its own thing, subject to state guidance on best practices. Among the practices:  professional learning, enriched instruction, grouping, co-teaching, GTE specialists and self-contained classes.
A Hechinger Report in 2021 stated that Maryland’s 16% participation rate in GTE is highest in the nation. Still, Maryland reports that children living in poverty are the most underrepresented group in gifted and talented programs. Even the most committed GTE educators and advocates agree there’s a long way to go.
So now, should we come down on the side of more or less GTE? In a more moral nation, the problem would go away. There would be enough money to provide all students – from low-performing to gifted and talented – with an adequate, equitable education.
Of course that’s a cop-out. In the real world, the inescapable issue is whether the equity issues are so knotty that GTE, as some critics argue, should be abandoned altogether. I don’t think so.
Instead, even without more funding, GTE can be improved in various ways. For example, more data and evaluation of what’s working best. Another is to target scant money to what are called “talent development programs“ that seek to expand the number and racial balance of students qualifying for GTE.
Still, in the near future, I can’t support more funding because of the multiple competing needs. Advocates must, in the midst of the state’s fiscal crisis, set limited priorities.
For now, sorry to say, the best we can do is forcefully advocate for brighter prospects in the years ahead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-52077072-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

Richard Blumenthal sees a “flagrant abuse” of norms and traditions throughout President Donald Trump’s first year back in the White House, the Connecticut Democrat said during an appearance on The Connecticut Mirror’s “In The Room” series.
Appearing Tuesday night from West Hartford Town Hall with host John Dankosky, Blumenthal was peppered with questions about the temporary hold on federal nutrition assistance, Trump’s recent threat to Democratic members of Congress and the dismissal of criminal indictments of officials who have clashed with the president.
As he answered each of these questions, Blumenthal essentially started with a caveat about how he views the administration.
“We are living with an administration that is cruel and stupid in a lot of what it does,” Blumenthal said when discussing the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s unprecedented hold on SNAP benefits during the government shutdown.
The hour-long conversation delved into familiar themes and issues that Blumenthal has waded into in recent months, including his concerns of politically motivated prosecutions and investigations. 
The three-term Democratic senator questioned U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi at a Senate hearing last month about any conversations she may have had with Trump regarding the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. That line of inquiry landed him in hot water with Trump, who issued a threat of an investigation into the senator over a past characterization of his military service.
On Monday, criminal indictments of Comey as well as of New York Attorney General Letitia James were dismissed as the judge found that Trump’s appointment of the interim prosecutor was unlawful.
Blumenthal, who formerly served as Connecticut’s attorney general, said that other than the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration, there has generally been a tradition to keep the Justice Department independent from the White House.
“What we’re seeing is the most kind of flagrant abuse of that tradition and norm. Theoretically, the president could say and he has said ‘go after so and so’ regardless of the evidence, but here’s what happens: The cases are dismissed,” Blumenthal said, referring to the dismissals this week of the Comey and James cases.
He has proposed various bills as a counter, including one aimed at preventing political prosecutions that “would essentially prohibit these kinds of contacts between the White House directing the Justice Department.”
But Democrats have little recourse as the minority party in both chambers of Congress. And Blumenthal was candid about the likely fate of some of that legislation.
“I’m very clear there is not a chance that we’re going to have this legislation adopted any more than my legislation on the Insurrection Act that would prohibit the use of military troops against American citizens without some congressional review,” he said. “There are a lot of measures where guardrails and safeguards should be imposed that we will not see in this administration.”
Blumenthal also aired concerns about the start of investigations into some of the members of Congress who posted a video addressing U.S. service members and encouraging them to protect the Constitution, even if that means defying illegal orders. The video featured six Democratic lawmakers who are all veterans of the military and intelligence services.
Trump called it “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”
“I was just aghast. I would have been astonished, but it is President Trump, so we’re accustomed to hearing pretty astonishing things from him,” Blumenthal said Tuesday.
Blumenthal pointed to the bipartisan reaction a mere two months ago “when all of us agreed to lower the temperature” after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot. He said he expects those members of Congress to face a deluge of threats.
During an appearance on Fox News, Trump walked back the comments about the video, saying he wasn’t calling for the lawmakers’ execution. “I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble,” Trump said. 
Connecticut Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he didn’t agree with Trump’s comments, but he believed people on both sides of the aisle have contributed to the growing political violence in the country.
Blumenthal agreed with the sentiment that political violence has intensified in the U.S. and emanates from both ends of the political spectrum.
“There was a point where I received the intelligence briefings on threats to this country where they shifted from fears about extremists from outside the country to extremists within the country, and this is not limited to [the] right or left,” he said.
Blumenthal was originally supposed to sit down for the “In the Room” event last month but needed to stay in Washington for Senate votes in the early days of the government shutdown. After a record 43 days, the federal government reopened after the Senate struck a deal.
The Connecticut senator reiterated his disappointment over the deal since it didn’t meet Democrats’ demands over health care, specifically on the extension of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans.
Congress remains locked in a fierce debate over the fate of the tax credits, which were established under Democrats’ pandemic relief bill in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025.
The subsidies were intended to be temporary, and when they were extended for another two years in a different Democratic bill in 2022, the party at the time had control of the White House and all of Congress. Shouldn’t they have made it more permanent when they had the chance instead of subjecting it to budget fights?
“It’s probably more frequent than not that government programs go for a period of time and they have to be reauthorized. So that’s not too unusual. But the point here is these subsidies were expected to be wildly popular, and guess what? They are wildly popular, and you know where most of the people who benefit from them live — in red states that Donald Trump won,” Blumenthal said.
He said if Democrats win the majority in the 2026 midterms, there’s “no question that we will try to adopt a more permanent solution.”
But as things currently stand, the enhanced subsidies are set to expire on Dec. 31. And without congressional action, premiums are expected to rise for many in 2026.
Reports suggested Trump was warming to a temporary extension of the subsidies for another two years in a plan that was expected to be released on Monday. It would also limit eligibility to those who make up to 700% of the federal poverty line.
While an announcement was never officially scheduled for Monday and the details were light, the forthcoming proposal was delayed as the framework started to get pushback from some congressional Republicans skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, according to MS Now.The Senate is expected to take a vote on extending the subsidies by the second week of December. But Blumenthal isn’t holding his breath on the outcome.
“Donald Trump over the weekend said, ‘OK we’ll extend the subsidies for a couple of years,’ and he was immediately deluged by his right wing with criticism, so I think you have to recognize that we’re up against MAGA here,” Blumenthal said. “I think there will be a vote, and, unfortunately, I think Republicans will be bludgeoned into voting against health care tax credits extensions.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/blumenthal-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 21:57:01.301727

Twelve score and nine years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  
Now we are engaged in an uncivil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated, can long endure. Each day we are met with a new battle in this war. We acknowledge the heavy price paid by generations that this nation might live in freedom. It is altogether fitting and proper that we do this. We cannot rest until the principles of democracy, decency, and the Constitution are restored.  
But, in a larger sense, we cannot venerate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow our great institutions while the president desecrates and dismantles them. The brave and wise who came before expected that we would add not detract from their unfinished work. The world may little note, nor long remember the falsehood and cruelties now spoken and texted, but it will never forget the lasting damage being done here. 
It is for us the living, who still believe in democracy to be dedicated to advancing this unfinished work. We must take increased devotion to this noble cause for which so many have given their last full measure of devotion. Only by doing so can we be resolved that they did not do so in vain.   
Let it be our solemn request that this nation, under God, shall preserve the freedom so dearly won, free from hatred and autocratic ruin; and that the government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.

Dorene Lorenz of Juneau filed the suit on Friday in Juneau Superior Court, seeking damages from Jeff Landfield and the other owners of the Alaska Landmine, a popular Alaska political website that publishes a mixture of news, commentary and parody.  
Landfield, who backed Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, also publishes the Alaska Political Report, a sobersided news digest priced at $1,299 per year for lobbyists and others interested in activity at the state Capitol. 
Lorenz’s suit stems from a social media post in which Landfield ridiculed a recent appearance by Lorenz at a United Nations event in Switzerland. 
Landfield went beyond that appearance, which he labeled “bizarre,” and said, “This woman is an absolute nut. Remember when she got in trouble for using … state money for the Jesse Lee Home for herself?”
Lorenz asked for a retraction. Landfield refused, and reiterated his belief in a video posted on Facebook.
Lorenz filed her lawsuit in response, saying Landfield’s claim is false. She asked for financial damages for slander and defamation, a correction and retraction. 
Lorenz, who has experience representing herself in court, filed the lawsuit on her own behalf. 
“She’s a f***ing lunatic,” Landfield said of the lawsuit on Tuesday. 
“Anyone who has themselves as a client is a fool, as the old saying goes,” he said, adding that he looks forward to the discovery process and showing what happened with the Jesse Lee Home.
That building was a former orphanage and the home of Alaska Flag designer Benny Benson in the early 20th century.
During the administration of Gov. Bill Walker, state lawmakers allocated almost $7 million to restore the building, but grants given to a Lorenz-chaired nonprofit called the Friends of the Jesse Lee Home were terminated after a series of “reporting issues and accountability issues.”
Lorenz said by text on Tuesday that most of the grant money was never disbursed to the nonprofit she administered.
In 2018, Fred Parady, then deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development, told Alaska Public Media that he didn’t think anyone involved with the project stole money. 
In her legal complaint, Lorenz notes that Landfield was aware of that reporting and repeated his claim anyway.
Under Alaska law — which mirrors federal law — a public official filing a defamation claim needs to prove that someone knew what they were saying was a lie or that they willingly ignored evidence that their statement was a lie. 
By text message, Lorenz said the 2018 reporting by Alaska Public Media shows that the state believed that the Friends of the Jesse Lee Home were spending too much money on classes within the school and not enough on the building itself. 
“Landmine has asserted otherwise, with actual malice, and continues to do so,” she said. “Not cool.”

Department of Veterans Affairs)Caring for South Carolina’s elderly veterans has been one Upstate company’s focus for nearly three decades. A recent state contract will further extend that streak.
Anderson-headquartered HMR Veterans Services operates four of South Carolina’s six nursing homes for veterans.
The company started with the Richard M. Campbell Veterans Nursing Home, located in Anderson and named for the brother of the late former Gov. Carroll Campbell. Richard Campbell was a sergeant in the U.S. Army killed in action during the Vietnam War.
HMR has run Campbell’s namesake home since 1998 and will continue to do so through at least February 2033, along with Veterans Victory House in Walterboro. HMR has held contracts on the Lowcountry home since 2007.
For its services at the two homes, HMR will receive an estimated $375 million, paid by state and federal taxes. HMR was the lowest bidder of three finalists — at a rate of $333 per bed per day, compared to the high bid of $425 per bed per day — for seven-year contracts starting March 1.
Contracts for two other homes HMR runs — one in Gaffney and one in Florence — are out for bid now.
Outside the Palmetto State, HMR also runs all five of Alabama’s veterans homes and six out of 10 in Texas.
That brings the company’s total to 15 homes with 3,000 employees across three states.
SC’s investment in veterans
In SC, hundreds of veterans go homeless. These groups received state money to help.

For all six homes in South Carolina, state taxpayers spend about $80 million annually to collectively care for 800 veterans, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
In a state with 400,000 veterans, the homes always have a waiting list, he said.
Future expansions, including new homes planned for Orangeburg and Horry counties and a replacement of a Columbia home with a newer facility planned for Lexington County, will eventually increase capacity to more than 1,080 veterans.
The construction timeline of those new homes depends on congressional spending, since federal taxes cover 65% of the cost. South Carolina must kick in the other 35%. Total funding could five years away, Hilliard said.
A focus on veterans
Operating homes for veterans is the only thing HMR does, which makes the company unique nationwide, Russell Keogler, vice president of corporate operations, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“There are competitors out there, but their main focus is on traditional nursing homes,” Keogler said. “For us, this is all we do and all we do every day.”
That gives HMR an advantage when it comes to meeting the unique needs of veterans, according to Keogler.
HMR has specialists on hand to treat illnesses more common to veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. As Vietnam and Korean War veterans are aging, they are also facing more health complications from exposure to toxins, such as Agent Orange used during the war to remove trees and foliage in the dense jungle battlegrounds.
A company history
Still, HMR wasn’t always just a veterans-based company.
Michael McBride, a nursing home administrator, founded it as Health Management Resources, Inc., in 1993, after leasing his first six nursing homes.
Its first veterans’ home, the Campbell facility, became part of the portfolio in 1998, seven years after it opened. That’s also when Army veteran William Biggs, the husband of freshman U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs, joined as CEO. He had been the administrator of the home in Anderson when HMR took over the contract.
At one point, HMR had as many as 27 veteran and non-veteran facilities across five states, according to McBride’s biography on the company website. In 2010, the company sold 21 hospice, rehab and pharmacy locations to a private equity firm but held on to the veterans’ services side of the business.
McBride continues to sit on HMR’s board of directors, as does the widow of another HMR co-founder, Ed Childress.
William Biggs retired and Ladeeb Diab replaced him as CEO in May 2023. Eight months later, Biggs’ wife launched her campaign for the ruby red congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Duncan, who chose not to seek an eighth term. Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner, emerged the winner of a seven-way GOP primary contest in June 2024. Her 3rd District win last November sent two South Carolina women to Congress for the first time ever.
William Biggs declined to comment for this article, citing a noncompete agreement he signed upon retirement that prevents him from speaking about the company.
The congresswoman, in financial disclosures filed last month, reported more than $4 million in income  from the sale of her husband’s minority interest in HMR businesses.
Members of Congress are required to annually disclose their finances. But they’re only required to report a range of how much their assets and liabilities are worth, so the couple’s exact earnings are unknown. But she valued the capital gains for each of four HMR businesses at more than $1 million.
‘Push the envelope’
Keogler said HMR has sought to “push the envelope” in other ways as well.
For example, at the request of states it contracts with, HMR began running its own pharmacies at its homes, instead of calling in prescriptions from elsewhere.
“We can do all of our medication reviews right in house, and our pharmacists actually know the residents,” he said. “It’s no longer just filling a prescription. It’s taking care of a veteran who you see every day.”
HMR also weathered staffing shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does so through a scholarship program, paying for the education of any certified nursing assistant employed by the company who wants to pursue a higher-level licensed practical nursing degree.
New SC law aims to ensure no veteran dies without proper recognition

“We help cover the cost of their tuition and books. We provide them a mentor to help guide them through the program, all while they can continue to work on this flexed academic schedule that builds professional growth for the individual and provides us a constant source of new nurses,” Keogler said. “I think it’s those innovative practices, which we’ve accelerated over the last two years, that really caught the attention of our state partners.”
A huge cost benefit
There are other reasons South Carolina’s more than 386,000 veterans and their families may choose a veterans home.
“It’s really camaraderie and connection,” Keogler said. “There’s a true brotherhood that exists in the service and that comes out later on in life.”
Also, there’s a huge cost benefit to families when they select a state veterans home. With military service benefits, the cost is far less than that of a traditional nursing home.
The federal government pays states a daily rate which can cover up to 50% of the homes’ operating costs. For veterans deemed at least 70% disabled due to injuries related to their military service, their cost is covered in full, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
The remaining costs are covered by state taxes or by the veterans themselves, said Hilliard, who was previously HMR’s executive vice president of operations. He joined the state agency in April 2024 after it took over the homes’ operations from the state mental health agency.

Above average
South Carolina also is in the minority of states — one of 13 — that pay private contractors to run all of its homes, though more states are trending that direction, Hilliard said.
While private contractors run the homes, the state public health agency and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are tasked with inspecting them. And the state veterans agency employs someone on site at each home, Hilliard said.
“Our homes consistently perform at or above national averages,” he said.
Three of the four HMR-run homes in South Carolina have recently received high marks.
State and federal regulators inspected the Anderson and Walterboro homes seven times over the past four years. Some reviews were the result of complaints and required the homes to make improvements. But each received a government rating of four out of five stars.
The Gaffney home has gone through four inspections and one improvement plan in that time and has a perfect rating.
The Florence home, however, sits at a two out of five. Federal reports site shortfalls in a handful of patient treatment plans for residents with medical issues including diabetes, a feeding tube and ulcers and bedsores.
The Columbia home, which is run by Avalon Health Care Group rather than HMR, also has a two-star rating. The same group also runs the state’s newest veterans’ home in Sumter, which opened in January. It hasn’t been rated yet.

HMR also made headlines in 2018, when the wife of a U.S. Air Force veteran alleged her husband suffered repeat infections, hospitalizations and unexplained bruises while he was in the Walterboro home, the Independent Mail reported.
And in May 2018, HMR settled a $425,000 lawsuit involving a veteran at the Anderson home who had a latex glove lodged in his airway. He died five days later.
Hilliard, who was still working for HMR at the time, told the Independent Mail: “Health care is a very litigious environment. A settlement does not constitute an admission of liability.”
State Department of Public Health investigations around this time found 13 violations involving “policies and procedures, staff training, resident records, resident care and medication administration.” The agency fined HMR $3,600.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RICHARD-M.-CAMPBELL-VETERANS-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-11-25 20:58:03.536232

Spencer Cox said he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals.,"Gov. Spencer Cox responds to a reporter’s question during the governor’s news conference broadcast by PBS Utah at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. (Pool photo by Tess Crowley/The Salt Lake Tribune)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Tuesday he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals. 
“It’s something that I do support,” Cox told reporters Tuesday during his monthly news conference hosted by PBS Utah.
The governor also said he doesn’t see growing the benches as court packing, a practice members of Utah’s congressional delegation denounced when it was proposed at the federal level by Democrats.  
State lawmakers considered making the move earlier this year as they grew more frustrated with recent Utah Supreme Court decisions, including one maintaining a stay on a ban they passed on abortion while it’s challenged in court. Another decision limited the Legislature’s power to undo and replace voter-approved government reform initiatives.

Rather than citing dissatisfaction with the courts’ written opinions, lawmakers at the time pointed to growing caseloads and complex legal arguments. The governor echoed those reasons Tuesday, saying it makes sense to expand Utah’s Supreme Court from five justices to seven to “start moving justice quicker through the system. I think that really matters.”  
Data provided by the Utah court system points to the appeals’ courts growing caseload, with legal filings at the Utah Supreme Court reaching a high of 270 in the state’s 2025 fiscal year, which ends in June. The Court of Appeals fielded 1,143 filings in the same time frame, up 7% from a year earlier. 
But two Utah Supreme Court justices have said growing their panel won’t help them.
Justice Paige Petersen said earlier this year that it’s “misinformation” and “absolutely false” to say “we need more members of the court because they have a backlog.”
“We haven’t had a backlog for years,” Petersen said in a Utah Judicial Council meeting in February.  
Utah Supreme Court disputes lawmakers’ allegations that it’s not productive enough

Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that adding more justices could lead to more deliberation, delaying timelines further. He told the newspaper he and his colleagues care about being efficient “but more than anything else, we want to get it right under the law, under the Constitution.”
When Democrats in Congress proposed expanding the U.S. Supreme Court in 2021, Utah’s Republican U.S. senators condemned it as an attempt at court packing, saying legislators were trying to undermine the independence of the judicial branch. 
Asked if expanding the appeals courts in Utah would be court packing, Cox said, “I’ve never looked at it that way.” He told reporters he does not share the same consternation lawmakers have with the courts. 
A majority of states have at least seven justices. That includes neighboring Colorado and Nevada. Idaho and Wyoming have five. 
Cox said he also supports setting aside more resources for district court judges, who oversee criminal cases and lawsuits throughout the state. 
“I’ve seen their dockets,” Cox said. “They’re really backed up.” 
The governor last month signed a bill into law last month that allows him to pick the Utah Supreme Court’s chief justice every eight years. Cox had vetoed an earlier version that set the term at four years.

But as the City Council on Tuesday gave its full throttled, 7-0 support to request help via the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act, Gov. Jim Pillen doubled down on his resistance.
Pillen, whose approval is required to tap the incentive, told the Nebraska Examiner this week that the state has been “duped” for too long in approving sales tax exemptions he believes only shift the burdens to property taxes.

“Our state sales tax has been Swiss cheese for 45 years plus,” he said. “We don’t have a sales tax base to afford to do very much of anything.”
The governor has said he will not consider approval of any SAFFAA application until June at the earliest — after the next legislative session during which he hopes lawmakers will pass property tax relief. 
Omaha City Council members pushed back on any notion that the turnback tax incentive for the two Omaha projects would harm the state’s financial picture. Councilwoman Aimee Melton, a Republican, called it a “win-win.” 
“This will be revenue positive,” Melton said. “The state will see an increase in revenue from Day One.” 
 Governor support needed

At issue is a state incentive for arenas and sports complexes previously approved by the Nebraska Legislature. Applicants go through a state board that includes the governor, who must be among the majority for a project to be approved. Nine projects not including the two Omaha athletic complexes already are pending.

Here’s how the financing incentive generally works for qualified Omaha ventures: Up to 70% of new state sales taxes generated within 600 yards of a sports facility goes to help pay off bonds for construction. The “new” tax revenue refers to sales at the facility or at retailers that sprout in the designated zone for a certain time after the project is announced. 
In most cases, city voters must approve the use of such bonds.
Omaha officials Tuesday expressed doubt that the two athletic complexes in question would move forward without the SAFFAA turnback tax approval. If all hurdles were cleared, the state incentive would help cover costs for:

Up to 16 multi-purpose athletic fields, a concession area and parking facilities at Tranquility Park near 120th and West Maple Road. The joint SAFFAA application will be submitted by the city and the nonprofit Omaha Public Facilities Corp. Public records show the city will seek up to $65 million in revenue bonds to pay up front costs. Initial documentation does not indicate how much of the turnback tax is being sought.
An open-air soccer complex owned by the city and used by the Union Omaha professional team near 11th and Izard Streets. Soccer officials project the overall stadium will cost $140 million, including $114 in “hard” costs and the rest for infrastructure. Partners in the application are the city and Downtown Soccer Stadium, a nonprofit affiliated with the Union Omaha ownership group. The city says it will request $25 million from the state turnback tax.

Jennifer Taylor, deputy Omaha city attorney, said if the turnback tax was not granted, Omaha would have to stop and reevaluate.
“We’ll have to put the brakes on,” she told the council.
 New ‘gateway’ to city 

David Levy, an attorney representing the Union Omaha project, described the 6,500-seat stadium as “a milestone in a long and really exciting journey.” It would be home to both the men’s professional soccer “Owls” team and a new women’s soccer team.
New $140M Union Omaha soccer stadium, mixed-use village could hinge on paused state sports incentive

Other community uses, including games by high school teams, are envisioned for the stadium, which would be owned by the city and leased and managed by Union Omaha. 
Levy said that projections show the stadium generating more tourism-related and other revenue for the city and state than the $25 million sought from the turnback tax over 20 years. Other sources, including tax-increment financing and program revenue, also would help pay for the stadium.
Partners expect new private housing, retail and commercial development of between $300 and $400 million near the complex. 
“This will be a great gateway and front door to our city at that location,” Levy said.
Melton said the land on which the stadium would rise currently is largely vacant and draws little property tax revenue. She said new tax revenue to be generated in that stadium zone would not exist if not for the project.
The city is seeking to buy the roughly 25 acres around 11th and Izard Streets from Union Pacific Railroad for $18.7 million for the soccer stadium project. 
In a move not necessarily related to the stadium, the railroad seeks to buy back from the city long-vacant land at 1441 Capitol Ave. That square block, priced at $7.3 million, was once Union Pacific’s headquarters. The railroad told the Nebraska Examiner in a statement Friday that it is considering developing the property, but no firm decision has been made.
Public hearings on both land purchase agreements are to take place next Tuesday.
 Tranquility growth

In an effort to safeguard taxpayers, both sports complex agreements are to include assurances that partners have sufficient funds before the projects move forward, Taylor said. 
City Councilman Pete Festersen, a Democrat, said he was excited to support the projects he sees as a lure for families and young athletes and hoped that state partners would look favorably on the ventures.
At age 50, Omaha’s Tranquility Park athletic complex is getting $54 million makeover

The turnback tax application, he said, “is very important to the overall picture.” 
Around the Tranquility Park campus, which is a half century old, the Mulhall family proposes to build a mixed-use private development — contingent on the new additional sports facilities, council members said. 
The City of Omaha began talking years ago about upgrading the park to draw regional and national tournaments. The park is managed by the Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.
In early 2024, the city selected JEO Consulting Group for planning development and design. The city tapped Kiewit as construction manager.
City Councilman Brinker Harding, a Republican running for Congress in the Omaha-based 2nd District, urged state decision-makers to approve all turnback tax projects if they’re revenue positive. He said he sees benefits to athletic activities beyond physical exercise. 
“It teaches our kids responsibility, dedication, accountability, sportsmanship and those are all good values we want to instill in our youth,” he said. “I’m a big believer in that youth sports can be a great pathway for that.”

But as we transition away from fossil fuels, energy demand will increase as we electrify our lives and as energy-intensive industries proliferate.  
This complicates our state’s path to decarbonization.
As part of the transition, solar energy in Washington could cover tens of thousands — possibly hundreds of thousands — of acres in the coming years.
Where all those solar panels go is a serious question.
Rooftop solar is great. However, the most ambitious estimates show that, at best, it would meet less than 30% of the state’s energy needs.
Farmland is a prime target for solar developers because the land is typically flat, already cleared, relatively accessible and sunny.
But the prospect of farmland conversion to solar energy has created tensions in rural communities and led to roadblocks on agricultural solar arrays.
Rather than converting farmland to solar facilities, we could build solar arrays and continue growing crops and raising livestock beneath the gentle shade of the panels. This approach is called “agrivoltaics,” and it could be one way to ease competition between the agriculture and solar energy sectors.
Solar arrays cast a shadow but don’t fully shade the land beneath.
This means some crops and smaller livestock can be grown and raised underneath and between the panels. And if you raise the panels a few feet higher, beneath them you can grow taller crops, trellised fruit trees, or graze cattle.
Even better, the partial shade from the solar panels can reduce sunburn and heat stress for fruits and vegetables and improve animal welfare. The shading can also reduce irrigation needs.
Solar panels and support posts can be used to replace some farm infrastructure as well, like trellising and shade cloth.
Through a collaboration between American Farmland Trust, Washington State University, The Nature Conservancy, and colleagues at University of California, Santa Barbara, we recently published a report on the feasibility of agrivoltaics in Washington for the state Department of Commerce. The research was funded by Climate Commitment Act revenue.
Our work included cutting-edge modeling to assess the joint production of solar energy and crop yield and quality at the field scale for apples, lettuce and berries. And we surveyed more than 100 farmers statewide to learn about their perspectives on solar energy, including agrivoltaics.
Our discoveries show incredible potential for the future of clean energy in Washington.
Farmers surveyed were substantially more supportive of agrivoltaics than converting farmland to solar arrays without maintaining agricultural production.
Fifty-five percent of the farmers surveyed were more interested in marrying solar and agricultural land when they learned about the idea of agrivoltaics and 57% of the farmers surveyed were moderately or very interested in hosting an agrivoltaics system on their lands.
Washington residents deeply value protecting both agricultural and natural lands. They also value rapidly transitioning to renewable energy sources.
In 2025, the state Legislature passed Senate Bill 5445 to encourage a diversity of distributed energy systems, including agrivoltaics.
This is a great start, and we need more. Farmers and ranchers, solar developers, scientists and policy makers can build on this momentum to support Washington’s agricultural communities, protect our lands and build the renewable energy future we need without losing valuable agriculture and natural lands.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-farm-agricultural-land-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

Jim Pillen for reelection,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/11/25/donald-trump-endorses-gov-jim-pillen-for-reelection/,The key backing comes as Trump donor Charles Herbster mulls a GOP rematch of the 2022 governor’s race.,"Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen speaks at an event at the Washington County Fairgrounds. Oct. 19, 2025 (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump endorsed Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen’s reelection bid at a momentthat some hope might prevent a bruising GOP primary for governor with former Trump donor Charles Herbster.
In a social media post Tuesday, the president gave Pillen his “complete and total Endorsement for re-election.” Trump pointed to Pillen “working tirelessly to Champion Nebraska Values” and other reasons.

“A very successful Veterinarian, Businessman, former Nebraska Cornhuskers football player under the LEGENDARY Coach Tom Osborne, and now, as Governor, Jim has a Proven Record of Success!” Trump posted on Truth Social. 
The president ended the post as he does most of his GOP endorsements on social media, writing, “HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”
Pillen, in a Monday afternoon response to the president on social media site X, wrote that he was “deeply honored to have earned” Trump’s endorsement. 
“Conservative leadership matters, as he has proved time and again,” Pillen said on social media. “Thank you, Mr. President.” 
The endorsement comes as Herbster has increasingly sharpened his criticisms of the governor online. Herbster has said he is considering a rerun of his 2022 GOP gubernatorial bid, which he lost to Pillen, finishing second in a three-way race at the top with then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.

Herbster told the Examiner recently that, “Pillen’s shortcomings make it hard to say no” to running in 2026 and that he will decide closer to the new year. He had criticized Pillen for, among other things, not listening to the business community, for not selling the state aggressively enough to business leaders elsewhere and for resisting voter-approved medical cannabis. 
Herbster, in a statement, said while he is disappointed in Trump’s endorsement, “it is entirely reasonable that he would endorse the incumbent Republican governor.” He said he is still committed to exploring a run for governor. 
“This race is not about President Trump,” Herbster said. “It is about hard-working Nebraskans trying to make ends meet. It is about our farmers and ranchers, who have been asked to sacrifice for far too long. It is about the businesses trying to grow and bring jobs to our state, only to be met with roadblocks and mismanagement from this administration.”

Trump backing Pillen is a dramatic change from the last time Herbster faced the former University of Nebraska regent. In that race, Herbster had Trump’s endorsement, and the governor was backed by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, whom Pillen appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2023. Herbster was the president’s first major endorsed Republican candidate to lose in a 2022 GOP primary.
Pillen cruised to a general election victory against then-Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue after beating Herbster. 
The governor worked hard to earn Trump’s endorsement, taking far more trips to Washington, D.C., and the White House than his predecessors. He also vocally supported the Trump administration locally, including volunteering the state to host a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail for migrants awaiting deportation proceedings at a state prison facility in McCook.
Pillen has taken some criticism at home from Democrats and some in his own party for what they said was putting Trump’s interests ahead of Nebraska’s.
Local political observers were buzzing Tuesday about the endorsement and what it might mean for the potential GOP primary. GOP consultant Perre Neilan of Neilan Strategy Group of Lincoln said the endorsement might make Herbster reconsider running. Most endorsements are “nice to have but not critical.” Trump’s endorsement in a GOP primary is a “big get for Governor Pillen.”
“The Trump endorsement will definitely give Herbster pause,” Neilan said. 
Jacy Todd, another GOP candidate for governor, said, “It’s not about President Trump’s endorsement. It’s about the people of Nebraska endorsing me.” 
“Makes me wonder what President Trump sees in Pillen with the way he has poorly run our state,” Todd said. 
This week, former State Sen. Lynne Walz launched an exploratory committee to consider a 2026 run for Nebraska governor on the Democratic side. 
Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nebraska by roughly 2-to-1, with about 22% of the electorate either registered either nonpartisan or with a third party. The primary is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

NorthWestern Energy said a portion of the new Colstrip shares it will acquire on Jan. 1, 2026, will be transferred to a new subsidiary — one the utility said is not under the authority of the Public Service Commission.
In a recent letter to regulators, NorthWestern Energy also said the deal does not require approval by the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern sent the letter in response to questions from the Public Service Commission about an October filing the utility made with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about the new shares.
In the filing, the subsidiary, called NorthWestern Colstrip 370 Pu LLC, requests federal approval for selling electricity on its own as a separate and “unregulated” entity.
The filing has raised questions from not only the Public Service Commission — charged with regulating monopoly utilities in the state — but also a Montana energy watchdog.
For starters, does the filing leapfrog a critical step?
Does the transfer of assets from a regulated utility — whether Puget Sound Energy or NorthWestern — to a NorthWestern holding company subsidiary require federal and state regulatory approvals?
And either way, what does it mean for existing customers?
In a unanimous decision Friday, the Public Service Commission voted to hire outside counsel to intervene in the docket, and in subsequent motions on Monday, it revised the deal to spend as much as $25,000 on the intervention.
“The Commission felt it was important to intervene because we have deep concerns about whether the actions of NorthWestern Energy were in the public interest and what the impacts to customer bills will be based on these decisions they’ve made,” said Public Service Commission spokesperson Alana Lake.
Acquiring more Colstrip shares
In the last couple of years, NorthWestern Energy announced two deals to acquire additional shares of the coal-fired plant at Colstrip, taking its ownership from 15% to 55% of the plant as of Jan. 1, 2026.
NorthWestern announced the price tag for the acquisitions at Colstrip units 3 and 4 to be zero dollars, even as other companies back away from coal, facing state restrictions on carbon emissions and steep upkeep for old plants. (Units 1 and 2 were shuttered in 2020.)
NorthWestern Energy announced in July 2024 it would acquire Puget Sound Energy’s 370 megawatts of the Colstrip Plant.
The utility said that acquisition, coupled with a previously announced deal to acquire Avista’s 222 megawatts, would ensure Montana customers have “cost-effective generation” available during a transition to a “cleaner energy future.”
NorthWestern said the acquisition of the Puget shares would provide a benefit to existing customers starting on Jan. 1, 2026.
But in its letter to the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern described a different plan for the Puget shares. It said its subsidiary, NorthWestern Colstrip 370 Pu LLC, intends to sell the energy on the wholesale market under federal jurisdiction until NorthWestern customers need the capacity.
“To that end, Colstrip 370Pu entered into a 21-month contract with Mercuria Energy America, LLC, for the sale of all the output of the Puget Share,” NorthWestern said in its letter.
Bloomberg describes Mercuria as an energy and commodity trading company.
Separate from this case, but at the fore in Montana, is significant demand from data centers on the near horizon, a controversial issue that’s unfolding in communities and at the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern acknowledged it included the Puget shares in its own capacity forecasts, but also said analyses, both before and after the announced acquisition, show it could meet its energy obligations without those shares.
So setting the asset aside is a benefit to customers, NorthWestern said.
“Holding the Puget Share outside the Montana Utility (NorthWestern Energy) relieves customers of responsibility for any costs or liabilities associated with the asset prior to it being required to meet utility load, while allowing the company an opportunity to offset O&M (operations and maintenance) costs through wholesale sales,” NorthWestern said.
Is it indeed a good deal for existing customers, as the utility said?
Anne Hedges, head of the Montana Environmental Information Center and one of NorthWestern’s outspoken critics, said other utilities have created similar setups, and the deal isn’t unusual.
But NorthWestern submitted the proposal to the feds just last month, and with the shares set to transfer come 2026, there’s little time to tell how customers will be affected.
“This deserves a whole lot more attention than NorthWestern is allowing, and that is what is so frustrating,” Hedges said.
Energy conservation group moves to intervene
Problems already are apparent in the filing in the federal case, however, said the Montana Environmental Information Center, a nonprofit and conservation watchdog, in its request to participate in the federal case.
For one thing, the nonprofit argues the subsidiary doesn’t show it secured federal authorization for the planned transfers in the first place.
In the absence of that authorization — or, alternatively, an explanation for why one isn’t necessary — the subsidiary’s filing to get approval for selling energy wholesale is “fatal,” the nonprofit argues.
Secondly, in the filing, the NorthWestern subsidiary has not shown existing customers aren’t getting shorted, the Montana Environmental Information Center argued.
The subsidiary’s filing is a request for a pricing structure for the plan to sell energy on the wholesale market. But the nonprofit said evidence suggests existing customers are getting a raw deal compared to anyone who might benefit from the wholesale sales.
For example, the maintenance costs the subsidiary provides in the filing are historical ones, lower than future projected costs, the nonprofit said. Additionally, it said, a new fuel agreement increases those costs at Colstrip as of Jan. 1, 2026.
In other words, the NorthWestern subsidiary “significantly underestimates” actual maintenance and operations costs, the nonprofit said. And it said the subsidiary itself describes its pricing structure as representing “ceiling rates,” meaning actual rates paid by wholesale customers could be lower.
“This means that NorthWestern’s retail customers will likely pay more than the affiliate’s wholesale customers for Colstrip-generated power, and risk being charged the affiliate’s unrecovered costs to maintain and operate the plants,” the nonprofit said.
Citing a statement by NorthWestern Energy, it also said the utility appears to have transferred transmission capacity to the new subsidiary “on terms that may reflect a subsidy by the utility’s retail customers.”
(In the meantime, NorthWestern continues to argue its transmission infrastructure is “severely constrained” and requires additional capital for reliable service, the nonprofit said.)
Hegdes said the cost of operations and maintenance for the Puget shares might be close to $25 million. NorthWestern earlier said the Avista shares would cost $18 million in operations and maintenance, and it asked to temporarily tap a customer credit to pay.
To ensure existing customers aren’t picking up the tab for costs that aren’t theirs, Hedges said state and federal regulators need data from NorthWestern, evidence of firewalls, and time for a rigorous assessment.
Instead, she said NorthWestern is offering a “shell game” and short shrifting the federal review process.
“We need transparency to show that NorthWestern and its market customers are the ones who are going to be shouldering those costs,” Hedges said.
Public Service Commission ponies up to intervene
In a Nov. 5 letter, the Public Service Commission asked NorthWestern Energy questions about the federal filing and pointed out its own role in overseeing utilities.
“The Commission has consistently exercised authority over mergers, sales, and transfers of utilities and utility property,” the letter said. But it said “it appears that NorthWestern Energy intends to transfer property that it has characterized as utility property.”
The letter asked NorthWestern to clarify whether it would seek approval from the Public Service Commission, and it asked for a “comprehensive explanation” if the answer was no.
In its response, NorthWestern Energy said it doesn’t own the Puget shares nor is it acquiring them “at this time,” and a separate “non-utility subsidiary” will acquire them on Jan. 1, 2026, so there’s “no basis” for the Public Service Commission to assert jurisdiction.
“Neither the Puget Share nor the Puget Agreement (the contract to acquire the Puget shares) has ever been used to serve Montana customers, placed in rate base, or recovered through Montana rates,” NorthWestern said. “The transfer of ownership will occur directly between Puget Sound Energy and Colstrip 370Pu, which is not a regulated public utility.”
But Lake, executive director for the Public Service Commission, said the Commission continues to have questions about the deal, including whether NorthWestern’s assertion the Puget shares transaction isn’t subject to state regulatory authority has merit.
Lake said she expects the Commission also will open a docket to investigate that question. For the time being, however, she said the priority is to ensure the Public Service Commission is able to intervene in the federal case given the risk the deal poses to customers.
The Public Service Commission is seeking late-intervener status in the case.
In one of its filings, the NorthWestern subsidiary explains why the call for federal approval of the transfer should be rejected. In part, it asserts the transfer of shares isn’t relevant to its pending request — for a wholesale pricing structure — and the amount of money at stake doesn’t hit the threshold for approval anyway.
Friday, Mike Green, a NorthWestern official, apologized to commissioners for not keeping them better apprised of its plans with the Colstrip plant.
“We’ve had some discussion about whether or not we should have come to the commission and sought your approval,” Green said at the meeting. “I will submit to you, we probably should have told you what we were doing, but I will also respectfully submit we didn’t need to, and there was no basis for us to ask for approval.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

This story by Lukas Dunford was first published in Valley News on Nov. 25, 2025.
QUECHEE — Traffic on the Quechee Gorge Bridge will continue to be limited to one alternating lane this winter due to delays in the ongoing $23.9 million bridge rehabilitation project. This will be the second winter in a row in which traffic on the bridge, which carries Route 4 some 285 feet across the Ottauqueechee River, has been restricted to one lane.
“I think it’s under two minutes … before the light will change,” said Nick Tsouknakis, owner of the nearby Quechee Pizza Chef. “So, you know, once people realize that, then it’s not that much of an issue.”
While the delays may be minor, Tsouknakis does attribute a decrease in the numbers of passersby to the bridge construction, which has been ongoing from spring to late fall since 2023.
“We’re going on 32 years here, and we’ve had constant gains over the years,” Tsouknakis said. “But less so since the bridge has been worked on.”
Route 4 is a primary connector between the Connecticut River Valley and destinations further west, from skiers traveling toward Killington to trucks driving to the New York Thruway. The bridge, which stands 165 feet over Vermont’s deepest gorge, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.
Originally expected to be completed in 2024, the project has been extended by delays due to supply chain issues and staffing shortages, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation, or VTrans.
Work has included rehabilitation and cleaning of the structural steel arch and its framing, which support the bridge deck, according to VTrans. In addition, railings and new sidewalks will be constructed.
In the construction season that is now concluding, workers completed a driving lane and walkway on the bridge’s south side, according to VTrans. Work on the north side, however, won’t be finished by the end of this year’s construction, as was originally planned.
The delay stems from the discovery of “additional deterioration of critical components of the steel arch” in the summer of 2024, according to a news release from VTrans last week. The development required additional design and detailing, the release said.
The extra work required traffic to be restricted to one alternating lane last winter, and is also the cause of this winter’s inability to open both lanes, according to the release. The bridge sits beside the Quechee State Park, which has closed certain trails during construction. Pizza Chef is among several nearby shops and restaurants that have experienced decreased traffic during construction.
Still, Tsouknakis understands the need for the bridge construction.
“It was something that needed to be done,” he said. “At the end of the day, I think it’ll be really nice.”
Although the north side has no accessible sidewalk, the contractor has vacated the southwest parking lot, which is now open to the public for parking, according to the project website. There is a protected sidewalk from the lot to the accessible bridge sidewalk.   
Construction will resume in March 2026 under the project contracted by the Glenmont, N.Y.-based Harrison & Burrowes Bridge Constructors, Inc. VTrans expects the project to be completed with two lanes of traffic and both sidewalks open for public use by late June.

The allegations center on how the state’s email management system handles Honor Wyoming’s emails to lawmakers. 
The post Dark money group questions transparency of Wyoming lawmakers, legislative staff appeared first on WyoFile .","Honor Wyoming, a conservative political group in Wyoming, has alleged since at least January that the state is blocking and censoring constituent emails to lawmakers, threatening to take legal action as a result. 
The allegations have led to the creation of a legislative panel to examine the matter, and even prompted some critics to accuse the group of pushing for transparency while not being open about its own leadership.
Since the organization made an expensive entrance into the state’s political landscape in 2024 via social media ads and billboards, Honor Wyoming has offered a convenient way for its website visitors to bulk email Wyoming lawmakers. 
When that resulted in thousands of emails landing in lawmaker junk or quarantine folders due to the state email management system’s default security settings, Honor Wyoming cried foul, describing the situation as a free speech violation. 
“Whether wittingly or unwittingly, the Wyoming Legislative Services [sic] Office has been censoring communications with legislators,” the group posted on its website in March. Three months earlier, the group had sent a letter to the state, threatening legal action if the situation was not remedied. 
In April, the Legislature formed a subcommittee to evaluate the group’s concerns in the off-season, also known as the interim, and to better understand the inner mechanics of Microsoft Outlook, the email management system used by the state of Wyoming. Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, co-chaired the subcommittee with Sen. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, alongside members Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson. 
Ultimately, the four lawmakers split on whether legislation was necessary, and tensions flared last week as the Management Council discussed the subcommittee’s findings. 
“All of the emails are being delivered,” Crago said at the meeting in Cheyenne. “Every one of us in this room and all of our colleagues are receiving the emails from the group that has showed up here to testify and asked for transparency, oddly enough, but can’t even tell us who their board of directors is. I find that somewhat ironic — asking for transparency when unwilling to tell us who’s paying the bills back home.”

Because Honor Wyoming is a nonprofit, it is not legally required to publicly disclose the details of its funding. When the source of political money isn’t known — unlike funds raised by politicians and political action committees, which are required by law to be publicly disclosed — it is referred to as dark money. According to The Center for Public Integrity, nonprofits and corporate entities, such as limited liability companies, are the two most common vehicles for dark money in politics. 
At the meeting, Sen. Gierau asked the group’s attorney, Drake Hill, about the organization’s makeup.
Hill is married to former Superintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill, and has previously served as chairman of the Wyoming Republican Party. 
“Can you tell me a little bit about Honor Wyoming? Like, who’s the board of directors? Who’s in charge of this outfit, Mr. Hill?” Gierau asked. 
“I know that’s been a question that has been directed, and I know you’ve been interested in that question through the press yourself,” Hill said. “Honestly, I’m not aware of who the board members are, but I do know that the scope of their mission is to bring awareness to issues.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Bear led the charge on a bill to require legislative staff to produce a list of emails received by legislators. That way, Bear said, constituents concerned that lawmakers were not receiving their emails could confirm with staff. 
“There’s another side to this story. And that is that our constituents would like to contact us via email, and I’d like to be an advocate for those constituents,” Bear told the council. 
Ultimately, the council voted 5-5 to sponsor the legislation. Without a majority, the bill failed, but an individual lawmaker is likely to sponsor it for the 2026 budget session.

Staff explanation
The Management Council’s discussion began with a presentation by Legislative Service Office staff members. 
“I think maybe just to start off with, it’s important for everyone to know that these emails in question were all being delivered to legislators,” LSO Director Matt Obrecht said. “It was just a question of whether they’re going to your inbox, your junk folder, or your quarantine folder, all of which legislators have access to.”
Since the subcommittee met in July, “LSO has done a tremendous amount of work,” Anthony Sara, deputy administrator of operations, told lawmakers. 
“We’ve done a deep dive into our legislative email system and probably spent more time on this than anything else this [legislative off-season,]” Sara said. “It’s something that we obviously take very seriously and understand that you have to have your legislative email for important communication with your constituents.” 
That work included extended discussions with Microsoft and education with lawmakers about how to check junk folders and how to release quarantined messages into their inboxes. Staff also updated the Legislature’s website to inform constituents of who to contact if they’re concerned their emails are not being delivered. 
While some changes were made to the system settings, Sara said LSO “also learned that a lot of this is out of our control.
“The scores that Microsoft gives each email for spam, what’s called the spam confidence level, cannot be adjusted by users and is 100% determined by Microsoft,” Sara said. 
Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, asked LSO about Honor Wyoming’s accusations. 
“It’s been insinuated online and on billboards that our staff and certain legislators are purposely censoring emails and content thereof. Is that true?” Biteman said. 
“No, I can assure you that nobody within our IT section is selecting where emails go, nor do we have the resources to do that with the amount of emails that you all get,” Sara said. 
Lawmaker debate
Bear told the council that emails that land in a junk or quarantine folder are less likely to be seen. And as a lawmaker, he said he wants to “hear from everybody that I can.” 
A bill to require legislative staff to publish a partially redacted list of quarantined email addresses each working day of the legislative session and once a week otherwise, Bear said, would help solve that problem. 
“I’m here today to try to come up with a solution so that even though we have [security] risks that we live with, the First Amendment opportunity of our constituents to contact us and discuss things with us via email is continued,” Bear said. “There are people like the good Vice President of the Senate and myself who have fought, many have died, so that we would have a First Amendment, a right for the people to bring their grievances to their government.” 
Throughout his testimony, Bear referred to constituent emails as being “blocked” — a characterization that several members of the committee disputed.

“We’ve established the fact that no emails have been blocked. So you’re being disingenuous when you use the term ‘blocked,’” Biteman said. 
Bear said he would “attempt not to use the word,” but “I will tell you that’s my perception. That’s the perception of probably 99% of people out there.”
Whatever term the Legislature finds appropriate, Hill, Honor Wyoming’s attorney, said, the objective is “that we allow for constituents to be heard in whatever manner” the constituent uses to communicate.
“None is more important than another and none is less important than the other,” Hill said. 
Neiman also spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that the issue is much larger than Honor Wyoming. 
“As I’ve listened to this, I guess the thing that kind of resonates with me is, this really isn’t because of one organization’s issue,” Neiman said. “This wasn’t specific — I mean, we have one organization that came and spoke to us today, but there were multiple organizations that were discussed, [American Gun Owners Association], and others.” 
The bill “isn’t for one organization, it’s for the citizens of the state of Wyoming,” he said. 
But if the issue was one of importance to Wyoming residents, Biteman said, “this room would be full of people testifying. Nobody showed up. Not a single person other than the group who’s caused this whole thing to be before us today.”
Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, took things further, arguing that the bill was about something else entirely. 
“The conversation we’re really having here today is about Wyoming being taken over by large political, well-funded organizations that have the ability to control your elected [officials] through fear and misinformation, wittingly or unwittingly, creating confusion and fractionalization of our great state,” Nethercott said. “It must come to an end.”
In the meantime, Nethercott encouraged residents “to keep communicating with your legislators directly” using the contact information provided on the Wyoming Legislature’s website. 
Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, and Reps. Bear, Neiman, Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland and Scott Heiner, R-Green River, voted in favor of the bill, while Sens. Biteman, Crago, Gierau, and Nethercott and Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, voted against it. 
The 2026 budget session convenes Feb. 9.

(Gerald Herbert/The Associated Press)Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, who rolled back government vaccine distribution as the state’s top public health official, has been appointed to the second highest position at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Abraham, a 71-year-old medical doctor, lives in rural Richland Parish and served as a Republican congressman representing Northeast Louisiana from 2015-21. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Abraham has espoused skepticism about vaccines for years. After becoming appointed surgeon general last year, he scuttled the Louisiana’s longstanding vaccine promotion program, shutting down its advertising campaign and eliminating mass vaccination events the state has conducted for decades for the flu and other diseases. 

Recently, Abraham also drew criticism from other public health experts for waiting several weeks to make a public statement and offer guidance on whooping cough after two babies in Louisiana died from the illness earlier this year. 
Gov. Jeff Landry, who has also expressed skepticism about vaccines, praised Abraham’s appointment to help lead the nation’s leading public health organization. 
“While we are certainly sad to lose Dr. Abraham here in Louisiana, we are thrilled to see the CDC gain a selfless leader,” Landry said in a prepared statement Tuesday. “There is no better advocate for health freedom than Ralph Abraham.”
Prior to his government roles, Abraham worked as a veterinarian treating animals for a decade and then returned to school and earned his medical degree in 1994 at age 40. He operated a general practice  and still treats patients on a part-time basis at a rural health clinic in Louisiana’s Mississippi Delta region, one of the poorest sections of the country. 
Gov. Jeff Landry tapped Abraham to be Louisiana’s health secretary for the first several months of Landry’s administration in 2024. The governor and state lawmakers then created the position of state surgeon general specifically for Abraham last year. In that job, the former congressman has been in charge of the state’s public health efforts and said he planned to focus on preventing diseases such as diabetes and obesity in Louisiana. 
In addition to casting doubt on the need for vaccines, Abraham has also promoted COVID-19 treatments that infectious disease experts have widely debunked. They include taking hydroxychloroquine, a medication used to prevent malaria, and ivermectin, a drug used for parasitic infections. 

As recently as last month, Abraham cited talking points promoted by anti-vaccine groups in a public appearance. At a press conference, he highlighted a Cleveland Clinic study that skeptics use to cast doubt on the usefulness of the flu vaccine. 
Staff at the Cleveland Clinic and other disease experts have pushed back on the interpretation of the study Abraham reiterated and emphasized the study doesn’t prove the flu vaccine is ineffective.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/surgeon-general.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780
