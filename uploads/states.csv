(Photo from Alaska Department of Public Safety)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.



We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Find out what happened to three men who were arrested in California and deported. Also: Marines at the border, the political and economic toll of the immigration raids and why Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News. 

After the arrest: In the past few weeks, federal immigration enforcement agents have rounded up 1,600 people — most of whom have no criminal conviction — during raids in Los Angeles County. CalMatters spoke to three people who were detained during the first weekend of the raids and deported to Mexico. Their reports suggest that agents are working under a new playbook that enables them to make arrests using dubious pretexts, and encourages agents to push people to sign removal forms before speaking with an attorney. Mauricio Oropeza, who has no criminal record, was detained while waiting at a bus stop after work. He was then shackled in chains and driven to an ICE tent camp in Texas. There, he signed voluntary removal forms before finally being allowed to make his first call to his family. Learn more about what happened to Oropeza and other immigrants like him from CalMatters’ reporters. 


Marines on the border: Dozens of Marines have been stationed at a Border Patrol station located in eastern San Diego County. Previously, the armed forces were kept away from civilian law enforcement, so this move signals a change in both how the Marines operate and President Donald Trump’s border strategy. A spokesperson for Newsom’s office said the Marines’ presence represents “mission creep.” Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.


Population shrink: During Trump’s first term, California’s population declined in part due to his administration’s policies that made it harder for foreign workers to enter the country. Now the state is bracing for a similar hit with his return, as deportations and limits to U.S. entry threaten the state’s economy and Electoral College clout. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn. 


Newsom sues Fox: On Friday the governor filed a lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the network of lying about the date Newsom last spoke with Trump on the phone, and for claiming the governor is lying about a call related to Trump’s deployment of federal troops in L.A.

CA braces for new fuel standard


Gas prices at a station in Victorville on May 19, 2025. Photo by Rene Ray De La Cruz, Daily Press via Reuters




The California Air Resources Board’s new rules for fuel standards take effect Tuesday. These rules aim to reduce air pollution but are controversial because they could also raise gas prices, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
The updated standard is expected to reduce carbon dioxide-equivalent gasses by an amount equal to the emissions of more than 120 million cars on average in a year, according to the air board. Gas prices aren’t expected to rise immediately due to the new rules, and it’s unclear whether they will since it depends on how much the oil industry passes costs onto customers when it buys credits. 
But when the fuel standard was last updated in 2011, a gallon of gas rose by an additional 9 cents. This update could add 5 to 8 cents per gallon, according to a UC Davis researcher.
Republicans have slammed the fuel rules, arguing that they would make the state even less affordable. GOP state Senate leader Brian Jones of San Diego called the standard, “nothing short of price gouging by Newsom.”

Disabled workers to lose jobs after union dispute


PRIDE Industries employees rally in front of the Capitol Annex Swing Space in Sacramento on June 11, 2025. Photo by Cristian Gonzalez for CalMatters




From CalMatters local news fellow Joe Garcia:
Barring any last-minute legislative intervention, 58 disabled workers at a California state prison employed through nonprofit PRIDE Industries will lose their jobs on Tuesday because of administrative decisions that followed a union complaint about them.
SEIU Local 1000, the union that represents state custodians, alleged in a complaint to the State Personnel Board that the contract between PRIDE and the California Medical Facility prison at Vacaville violated guarantees that those job positions be filled by union employees.
After multiple short-term contract extensions, the PRIDE contract ends July 1. Disabled environmental service technicians will work their last shifts inside the prison, clock out and walk to their vehicles unemployed.
The state posted multiple job openings for custodians at the prison earlier this month.
PRIDE claims their lost job positions will ultimately be filled by incarcerated Prison Industry Authority workers — and not SEIU members as intended. Prison officials said they wouldn’t comment, and neither would the state human resources department.
Heather Dunn, who has worked at Vacaville for more than five years, doesn’t know what the future holds or where her next job might be. As a 38-year-old single mom, she worries for her 2-year-old son. “He still needs the things that he needs. It’s going to be really hard to provide for him,” she said.

Dunn: “Before I came to PRIDE, it was very hard for me to keep and to find a job due to my reading disability.”

Ameer Habeeb, a 52-year-old service-disabled Air Force veteran, works with Dunn and will lose his position as an environmental services director. 

Habeeb: “PRIDE’s given me the opportunity to be accommodated and given me opportunities where I’ve been able to grow.”

PRIDE workers continue to plead with state legislators and Newsom to step in and help them keep their jobs.
Democratic Assemblymember Lori Wilson of Suisun City has a bill in the works to create pathways for disabled workers to be brought into the union so they can be included in state contracts.

(Photo courtesy of New Energy Equities)The Legislature passed a bipartisan energy bill during the special session June 9 without two provisions that Minnesota solar power advocates said would have threatened thousands of local jobs and limited consumer choice as the state transitions to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. 
“At the end of the day, clean energy goals don’t really mean anything if you don’t have a solar industry to develop projects,” said Logan O’Grady, executive director of the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association. 
Supporters of the discarded measures to sunset Minnesota’s popular community solar gardens program and reduce utility payments to rural and small-town solar customers said they were needed to keep power affordable during the clean power transition.
“These provisions are birds of a feather that both attempt to reduce the cost ratepayers pay for clean energy,” said Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato, chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities, Environment, and Climate Committee and chief Senate author of the 2023 clean power law. 
Frentz did not directly commit to bring up the measures again next session. But his committee “will do the same thing that I think all committees should do, looking at where we are as a state and deciding what we should prioritize,” he said. 
Earlier this year, Frentz’s committee voted 9-2 to advance a version of the 2025 energy omnibus with the net metering and community solar changes. A House version that did not include those provisions ultimately won out in special session negotiations.
Under current Minnesota law, community solar subscribers — including residential customers as well as businesses, nonprofits and government entities — pay solar garden operators a discounted rate for the power produced by their shares in the small arrays that dot fields and roofs around the state. They receive corresponding utility bill credits that can significantly reduce or offset the cost of electricity supplied by the utility.
The community solar program has grown dramatically since its 2014 launch, meaning Xcel Energy now pays subscribers hundreds of millions of dollars in credits annually. After years of legal wrangling, state regulators last year reduced the value of those credits in a move they said would save Xcel Energy up to $41 million per year. The ruling also expanded community solar eligibility to Minnesota customers outside Xcel territory.
Without the proposed changes, the average residential Xcel customer would have paid $7 per month in 2024 to support community solar subscribers, the Star Tribune reported. In 2023, Xcel estimated that community solar represented 20.5% of its electric fuel costs while providing about 3.8% of its electricity in Minnesota.
Frentz said this “cost shift” unfairly burdens regular utility ratepayers to benefit community solar subscribers, who make up a small minority of all Minnesota customers. A similar dynamic plays out between customers with onsite solar arrays, which receive “net metering” payments from local utilities that are generally much higher than the price utilities pay for power, he said.
“It’s around twice the cost that is then passed onto (customers) who did not agree to it and for the most part did not know about it,” Frentz said. 
Solar proponents say that’s not the full picture.
The cost shift is a “myth,” said Bobby King, Minnesota executive director for Solar United Neighbors, pointing to a 2024 Minnesota Department of Commerce study that said community solar would deliver nearly $3 billion in net benefits over 30 years.
In any case, last year’s Minnesota Public Utility Commission ruling and state legislation passed in 2023 went a long way toward addressing calls to reform the program, O’Grady said. 
The legislation, in particular, represented a hard-fought compromise between the solar industry and Minnesota utilities, ratepayer advocates and other groups, he said. It shifted responsibility for the program from Xcel to the Minnesota Department of Commerce; set declining annual caps on new statewide community solar capacity; significantly increased the maximum size of individual installations; and established carveouts for low- and moderate-income subscribers.
“The changes the Senate wanted to see already happened,” O’Grady said. “We didn’t love them all, but we agreed to them because we heard the message that they were needed.”
Further changes to community solar and net metering would constrain customer choice for customers who want alternatives to their local utility, he added. Reducing net metering payments lengthens the payback period for people who install solar on their properties, making those investments less appealing. 
Frentz argued this session’s debate was about leveling the playing field for all clean electricity sources in all parts of the state, rather than continuing to put a thumb on the scale for smaller-scale solar installations that today mostly serve Xcel customers. The promise of fairness and flexibility helped quell rural electric cooperatives’ and municipal utilities’ opposition to the 2023 carbon-free power law, he said.
Right now, the lowest-cost path to a carbon-free grid involves lots of large-scale wind, solar and battery power. But that could change as technological breakthroughs drive down the cost of other forms of power, like geothermal, Frentz said.
“Flexibility is the selling point,” he said.
Another threat: Republicans in Washington
Whether that flexible clean energy future comes to pass in time for Minnesota’s 2040 deadline depends to some extent on what happens in Washington, D.C. this summer. 
On May 22, the Republican-controlled House passed a sweeping budget that would rapidly phase out federal tax credits for wind, solar, geothermal and other carbon-free power sources. President Donald Trump urged the Senate “as soon as possible” to ratify the bill, which independent analyses say could dramatically reduce new clean energy deployments and add $33 billion to consumers’ annual energy bills by 2035.
Days later, Trump took executive action to force at least two aging, expensive coal- and oil-fired power plants to remain open past their scheduled retirement date, citing the “national energy emergency” he declared in the opening hours of his second term. 
If enacted, the Republican budget “would eviscerate our industry…we could see 75% of our members go out of business or get acquired by others,” O’Grady said. “To me, this is an anti-jobs bill.”
O’Grady’s focus right now is “putting names to faces” for GOP legislators whose votes could be decisive. A meeting between staff from top-ranking House Republican Rep. Tom Emmer and a dozen MnSEIA members representing about 2,000 jobs was cause for cautious optimism, and MnSEIA is encouraging members who do business in other GOP-leaning areas to engage with local representatives, O’Grady said.
No matter how the federal fight turns out, Minnesota’s solar industry is gearing up for another state policy bout in 2026.
“We fully anticipate this issue will be brought up next year and we will fight it,” O’Grady said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Long-Lake-CSG-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

No immediate hike in California gas prices will occur but Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature fear the effects of the clean-fuel program.


California’s revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard takes effect on Tuesday, despite fierce Republican criticism and increasing Democratic trepidation over its potential to raise gas prices.
The new rules — which expand a program to reduce climate-warming gases and clean the air  — ratchet up requirements for cleaner fuels and broaden a $2 billion credit market aimed at cutting emissions from cars, trucks and freight.
No immediate hike in gas prices will occur. Experts say the future impact is uncertain because it depends on how much the oil industry spends on buying credits and then passes it onto consumers.
The previous fuel standard, which was set in 2011, added 9 cents to the cost of a gallon; a UC Davis researcher estimates that the new one could add 5 to 8 cents per gallon.
The Newsom administration is bracing for more political attacks as Republican legislators have seized on the issue. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office issued a fact-check memo defending the rule and saying the impacts are exaggerated, while Republicans in the Legislature and Congress say it would damage the economy because Californians already pay the most in the nation for gasoline. State Sen. Brian Jones requested an audit of the rule, calling it “nothing short of price gouging by Newsom, hitting Californians where it hurts the most.”
Democratic lawmakers last week introduced legislation that would cap the price of the standard’s fuel credits in an effort to rein in price spikes at the pump. The measure is supported by one of the state’s most powerful Democrats, Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, who said it “will reduce costs for drivers across the Golden State while continuing to move our climate and energy goals full steam ahead.”
The new fuel standard is projected to reduce carbon dioxide-equivalent gases by 558 million metric tons through 2046, according to the air board’s economic assessment. Those reductions are equal to the emissions of more than 120 million cars on average in a year.  Some critics say that is an overestimate, because soybean fuels may not be as clean as reported.
Cleaner, low-carbon fuels include biofuels made from soybeans or cow manure. The program has been particularly successful in reducing the diesel fuels used by medium and heavy-duty trucks. Over the 13 years, it has displaced 25 billion gallons of petroleum fuels, according to the air board.
The new fuel standard was temporarily delayed earlier this year when the state’s administrative law office rejected it and sent it back to the air board to add more clarity to the rule. 
Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat, last month called for the resignation of California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph over concerns that the agency did not study the economic impacts of its new standard.
Randolph said in a statement that gas prices are “over a dollar per gallon cheaper than just a few years ago. Our efforts to deploy more zero-emission vehicles and reduce fossil fuel use is working to cut demand and create more competition in the fuels market, and the (fuel standard) is a big part of that effort.” 
In an unrelated action, California’s gasoline excise tax, which is adjusted annually, will increase by 1.6 cents per gallon on Tuesday. The tax is primarily used to pay for roads and highways.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/052925-Gas-Prices-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

Gavin Newsom’s office is making benefit deals with public employee unions that save money today in part by putting off payments that were meant to bring down costs tomorrow.

Gavin Newsom’s office is making benefit deals with public employee unions that save money today in part by putting off payments that were meant to bring down costs tomorrow.
His office this month negotiated seven agreements with unions that pause state spending for two years toward one of California’s largest long-term debts: the health care benefits civil servants receive in retirement. 
Newsom’s pause on the pre-funding payments for current workers has the potential to free up a lot of money. His office in May estimated those payments would cost the state more than $700 million in the new budget year.
But the promise to workers is massive: At the last official estimate, California would need $85 billion to pay for the retirement health care benefits it has promised to state employees. 
The governor’s move to suspend payments toward future retiree health care coincides with another big concession he’s asking from unions as he manages a $12 billion deficit. The new contracts include furloughs that trim take-home pay for public employees over the next two years and essentially negate the raises state workers are getting this year.
But six of the proposed labor agreements have a sweetener to ease the pain of the furloughs. 
Like the state, workers represented by those unions won’t have to pay anything toward their retirement health care for the next two years. Suspending that deduction puts between 1.7% and 4.5% of their earnings back into their paychecks. 
“For my members, the cost of living in the state is so high, it just gives them a little bit of relief in putting money in their pockets that wouldn’t be there otherwise,” said Ted Toppin, the executive director of the union that represents state engineers, Professional Engineers in California Government.
Service Employees International Union Local 1000, which represents about 100,000 California civil servants, announced Sunday that it also made a new labor agreement with the Newsom administration that gives workers a break on the retirement health care deduction for two years. Neither the union nor the state have said yet whether the agreement pauses what the state was supposed to pay for that benefit.
“This will boost take home pay,” the union said in its message to members.
Newsom’s predecessor, former Gov. Jerry Brown, created the plan to pre-fund retiree health care benefits by having both the state and employees chip in money every paycheck. He insisted on it in difficult labor negotiations that resulted in unions agreeing to what was then a new paycheck deduction.
Until then, California had paid for the retiree health care exclusively through the state general fund. Brown and others were concerned that the pay-as-you-go practice would eat up larger and larger slices of state spending because of the rising costs of health care.
This year, California expects to spend $3 billion on the health benefits its already-retired civil servants will use, up from $1.6 billion in the 2016-17 budget year.
The state calls that other post-employment benefits, or OBEB, meaning benefits in addition to pensions.
Over time, the contracts Brown negotiated would gradually create a trust fund for retiree health care and remove that expense from the pot of money the state uses for general government services. On the current timeline, that would happen some time in the late 2040s.
Toppin, who was involved in the Brown-era contract negotiations, said the state has flexibility to manage its goal for retiree health benefits.
“This is a long horizon,” he said. “At least for the state in this year and the near term the need is deficit reduction, and for my members the need is they gotta pay the bills.”
But it also comes with long-term risk and likely will delay the state’s plan to stop paying for retiree health care out of the general fund, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. 
“Suspending the state’s contribution to prefund (retiree health care) reduces costs today but contributes to a significant and growing unfunded liability and creates risk that the benefit will not be fully funded” by the state’s target date, legislative analyst Nick Schroeder wrote in an assessment of Newsom contract with the union that represents correctional officers.
The state expects to save about $100 million a year from the prison guard contract alone by suspending its payments toward correctional officers’ retirement health care.
Newsom previously allowed state workers to skip their paycheck deduction for retiree health care early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when his office negotiated labor agreements that included furloughs because of fears that the virus would trigger a painful recession. The state restored the money in the 2021-22 budget.
“The state remains committed to pre-funding retiree health,” said Camille Travis, the spokesperson for the state human resources department, in a written statement. “The suspension of contributions to the retiree health trust will help address the budget shortfall in the near term.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

(Photo courtesy of Tim Peterson, flown by Lighthawk)The U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture recently announced it would try to roll back the “roadless rule,” a decades-old policy that prevents road construction and logging on nearly 4 million acres of national forest in Utah. 
Brooke Rollins, the department’s secretary, called the rule “overly restrictive” and an “absurd obstacle” to forest management when she made the announcement during a Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico. The rule, she said, prohibits agencies from properly managing forests and preventing wildfire, while stifling the timber industry. 
Utah leaders celebrated the decision, with House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, calling it a “big win” for the state. 
But in Utah, proponents of the rule say it’s a vital tool for protecting the state’s forests, which in turn keep water clean, provide habitat for wildlife and allow recreation opportunities. 
“This rule protects almost half of the forest service land in Utah,” said Kate Groetzinger, communications director for the Center for Western Priorities. “This opens about half of Utah’s forest land to logging that has been previously protected. That can drastically change the feel of some of our most popular forests.” 
The scope of the roadless rule in Utah 
The roadless rule was established during the Clinton administration in 2001 and restricts road construction and reconstruction, and timber harvests, on roughly 58.5 million acres of the country’s national forests and grasslands. The goal, according to the forest service, “is to provide lasting protection” on some of the country’s most remote areas.  
Called inventoried roadless areas, the forest service created boundaries around roads and existing infrastructure to identify stretches of forest eligible for more stringent protection. Inventoried roadless areas are typically sorted into two categories — places where road construction or reconstruction is allowed, and places where it isn’t allowed. 
There are roadless areas along the Wasatch Front, in places like Big, Little, Millcreek and American Fork canyons; in vast sections of the Uinta Mountains; in southern Utah, near Moab and Monticello. They can be recreation hotspots, with some of the state’s most popular hiking trails on or near roadless areas.

Utah has roughly 8.1 million acres of national forest, according to the federal government, spread out across eight regions — Ashley, Caribou, Dixie, Fishlake, Manti-La Sal, Sawtooth, Uinta and Wasatch-Cache national forests. 
According to forest service data, about 4 million acres is inventoried roadless area — road construction and reconstruction is allowed on about 3.5 million acres, and prohibited on the remaining 446,000 acres. 
But according to Tim Peterson, the cultural landscapes director for Grand Canyon Trust, the distinction can be misleading. 
“We haven’t built a lot of new roads in our national forests over the last two to three decades,” said Peterson, who’s been involved in Utah’s roadless areas since the 1990s and helped conduct inventories for environmental groups. “Road building is so expensive and the forest service already has a maintenance backlog … we can’t even maintain the roads that we have, let alone build new roads.” 
Regardless of whether new road construction is or isn’t allowed, the rule generally prohibits timber harvesting in covered areas. There are exceptions, Peterson said, including mechanical thinning, removing trees killed by insects, or for fighting fire. 
In an email, Redge Johnson, the director of the Utah Public Land Policy Coordinating Office, acknowledged the exceptions, but said the state is still confined in its ability to manage forests to improve habitat and reduce fire danger.
“While the roadless rule allows for limited timber harvest it has so many restrictions it makes it nearly impossible for timber projects to be completed,” Johnson said. “Our forests are overgrown and unhealthy, it is past time that we start to actively manage our national forests.” 
Johnson shared a picture with Utah News Dispatch that he took while on a recent horsepacking trip through the Manti-La Sal National Forest, that shows an entire ridge with mostly dead coniferous trees. 
“Even though there are old logging roads on the ridge shown, we can not use them to remove the dead timber due to the restrictions from the roadless rule. Removing this dead timber would reduce wildfire risk, increase wildlife habitat and protect our watersheds,” Johnson said.

What’s next? 
Despite Rollins’ announcement, the federal government still needs to go through a formal process to rescind the roadless rule. 
That includes preparation of an environmental analysis, making sure the action complies with the Endangered Species Act, and consulting with local governments and tribes, according to the forest service. 
Johnson called Rollins’ announcement a first step. 
“Our office is awaiting more information on what the process will entail,” he said. 
Peterson noted that the Trump administration isn’t the first to try and rescind the rule. 
“It’s much more complicated than just saying you’re going to get rid of it,” he said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In 2005, the Bush administration tried to replace the it with the State Petitions Rule, which allowed governors to tailor their own national forest protections. Some states submitted plans that aligned with the original protections — others, like Idaho, asked for drastically reduced protections. 
The Bush administration’s rule was challenged in court and ultimately overturned.
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert also tried to petition the government for a Utah-specific roadless rule in 2019, which was ultimately unsuccessful. 
What to expect if the roadless rule is rescinded 
Assuming the administration is able to scale back the rule, there would be 4 million extra acres of forest service land in Utah that would be open for timber harvesting — the state says that would allow for increased wildfire mitigation and forest management. 
“We are excited with this new direction by the United States Department of Agriculture,  allowing the federal government, state partners and industry to address a variety of forest health and ecosystem services issues, like water quality/quantity, wildlife, forage and air quality,” said Johnson. “We are looking forward to engaging with the Trump Administration, USDA, and the Forest Service to promote healthy, diverse and productive forests here in Utah and across the country.” 
Rollins, in a recent op-ed for the Deseret News, said to date about 8 million acres of roadless forest around the country have burned in wildfire, and rescinding the rule would free up forest managers who she argues are constrained by the rule. 
The USDA also said rescinding the rule will help boost the state’s economy. 
“Utah alone estimates the roadless rule alone creates a 25% decrease in economic development in the forestry sector,” reads a press release from the department. 
Advocates for the rule, however, are skeptical. According to an analysis from the forest service, the roadless rule has led to an estimated reduction of just 59 jobs related to timber harvesting in Utah and Peterson said the logging industry in the state was never that robust to begin with.  
“There has never really been a huge timber industry in Utah,” he said, “and getting rid of the roadless area rule would not make for a big timber industry in Utah, because roads are so expensive to build.” 
If the forest service is serious about expanding timber harvesting, he said, it’s going to need a bigger budget. The agency’s deferred maintenance backlog for roads and bridges was estimated at $4.4 billion in 2022 and the president’s budget proposal would slash millions from forest service operations. 
“If we’re going to be building roads and doing timber sales, it’s not reflected in the budget that the administration has put forward to Congress,” Peterson said.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Powell-Point-in-Table-Cliffs-Henderson-Canyon-IRA-Dixie-NF-c-Tim-Peterson-Lighthawk-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

“We are currently awaiting the required list of nominations from the speaker, pro tem and lieutenant governor for this appointment,” a spokesperson from the Governor’s Office said.
Gwathney declined comment on Tuesday. She will continue serving as a member of the parole board until the governor’s office submits another candidate to replace her.

The former prosecutor’s six-year term overseeing the board has been controversial. Parole grants plummeted into the single digits during her term, though they have grown in recent years. Critics have laid much of the blame for declining parole rates at Gwathney’s feet. The board’s delays in updating parole guidelines drew sharp criticism from Democratic and Republican lawmakers, who made the board’s funding for 2026 contingent on the board drafting them.
“I don’t think there is a word that adequately describes how badly the last six years have been in terms of what the law was, what the goals were, and how, I am pretty sure, under her leadership, the parole board missed almost every one of those goals,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a longtime critic of both Gwathney and the current parole process.
“If there is a checklist out there for what is necessary to lose your job, I believe Leigh Gwathney hit every one of them,” he added.
New laws, declining numbers
Gwathney assumed office in 2019 after the Legislature approved an overhaul of the board. The move came after Jimmy O’Neal Spencer, was mistakenly released from prison in 2017. The following year, he murdered three people in Guntersville, including a seven-year-old child, during a series of robberies. A jury convicted Spencer of capital murder and sentenced him to death in 2022.
The 2019 law created a director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles and provided stricter rules for granting applicants parole, especially if they committed a violent crime. The legislation also established guidelines that would recommend if applicants should be granted parole or be denied.
The law required the parole board to update the guidelines every three years based on data to grant parole to applicants who are the least likely to be a threat to public safety.

The parole rate has declined dramatically since Gwathney was appointed to lead the parole board. According to data obtained from the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, the parole rate was 55% for 2017 before steadily declining for the next several years.
It was 53% in 2018, one year after Spencer murdered three individuals after earning release. It declined again in 2019 to 31%, to 20% in 2020, 15% in 2021, 10% in 2022 before reaching its lowest point to 8% in 2023. For 2025, the rate increased to 26%.
Matthew Mangino, a former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania who served for six years on the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, said in an interview that parole helps people transition from prison back into their community.
“It helps those individuals with re-entry skills, whether it is dealing with their criminal conduct in the past, finding a skill, or continuing rehabilitation or treatment,” he said. “And it is also an opportunity to monitor these people while they are on the streets to ensure they are not violating the technical aspects of their release or involved in other criminal activity.”
Criminal justice reform advocates said Alabama’s parole board made decisions that did not comply with established guidelines.
According to a September 2024 monthly statistical report, the guidelines recommended that 83% of applicants be granted parole for that fiscal year but the grant rate was 20%. That results in a conformance rate, the frequency with which the parole board follows its own guidelines, of 25% for that fiscal year.
For 2023, the guidelines recommended that 81% of applicants be granted parole while the board only granted parole in 10% of the cases, a conformance rate of 12%.
Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization, said the “unfortunate result” of the decline in paroles was that “more people are leaving prison at the end of their sentences with little or no parole supervision, which generally does not correlate with increased public safety.”
“The supervision and programming that comes from someone being granted parole generally means more services and more accountability for people leaving Alabama’s prisons,” she said. “A strong parole program with reasonable grant rates can contribute to public safety. Thousands of people exiting prisons, often after decades of living in violent, chaotic surroundings, with no supervision or programming generally does not.”

Some lawmakers also expressed concerns regarding the parole board’s decisions and the impact it has on the criminal justice system writ large, but especially on the violence and overcrowding within Alabama’s prisons.
“I am a second-chance person,” said Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro. “I believe that people deserve a second chance. And, at the end of the day, these people are going to get out at some point, whether they are going to EOS out, end of sentence, or they are going to die there. They are going to be released at some point in time. And so, I think when you continue to just deny people, deny people, when they have done everything that you have asked of them to do, it sends a bad message.”

Frustrations over guidelines

Some lawmakers have been increasingly frustrated with Gwathney and the parole board. Their frustrations culminated at a Joint Prison Oversight Committee meeting in October, when Gwathney gave what legislators considered evasive answers to direct questions.
Singleton said during an interview last week that he understood the difficulties of the job but that Gwathney and the parole board had not met his expectations.
“In the past, we have tried to get information, and we have not gotten the information,” Singleton said on Wednesday. “And when we have gotten information, it was misleading information.”
England was even more critical, accusing Gwathney of violating the law after the board went two years without updating parole guidelinesThe parole board in May proposed guidelines that will be submitted to public review, but England expressed doubts about their quality.
“It has been six years now, and what we have essentially done is waste time, a lot of money, and resources,” England said in an interview Wednesday. “Which includes changing guidelines and score sheets, depending on who was in front of her, so all that data is corrupted.”
Pennsylvania relied on guidelines to make parole decisions, Mangino said.
“We had the same numerical score that came from this guidelines process that would say whether someone was likely successful on parole or not,” he said. “You look at the crime, whether the defendant has taken responsibility for that criminal responsibility, you look at the actuarial tools as an aid to tell you what sort of risk, what sort of level of treatment someone might need, what medical health issues they have to deal with on the street.”
He also said that the state’s department of corrections would issue a recommendation for the parole board to consider.
“If you were going to go against the guidelines, you had to provide a written reason why you deviated from the guidelines,” Mangino said.
England has proposed legislation aimed at reforming the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles that would incorporate some of the factors Mangino used to guide his decisions.
The proposals included a validated risk assessment to guide parole decisions and to weigh whether a parole applicant is eligible for work release according to the Alabama Department of Corrections as factors for deciding parole. England also proposed legislation that requires members of the parole board to justify their decisions when they deviate from parole guidelines and allow applicants who have been denied parole to appeal their decisions to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.
Thus far, the bills have failed to pass the Legislature.

‘I don’t want to weigh in on that’

State senators who would approve the candidate for the board, whether Gwathney or someone else, declined to comment on her potential candidacy.
“I don’t want to weigh in on that,” said Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, last week.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, said that he would consider her if Gwathney is the nominee.
“I think she has done a pretty good job, pretty adequate,” he said. “I know she is criticized for not granting more paroles, but then again, not many of us are looking at the records either.”
Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, who publicly criticized Gwathney during the October meeting, said last week he was not willing to comment.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_016-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

The order put some universities on their heels, with Michigan State University abruptly canceling a Lunar New Year celebration due to the executive orders, later rescheduling the event following backlash from students. 
In the months since, the administration has issued a “Dear Colleague” letter providing educational institutions from pre-schools to universities with a Feb. 28 deadline to dispense with their diversity programs at risk of losing federal funding, arguing that these programs are discriminatory. 
Many colleges ignored the president’s demands, with the President of Western Michigan University instructing the campus to “please proceed as usual” according to a report from the Associated Press. 
In service of this decree, the United States Department of Education launched investigations into several universities across the country over race-based programming, opening investigations into Grand Valley State University and the University of Michigan on March 14. 
Less than two weeks later, the University of Michigan announced it would shutter its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Office for Health Equity and Inclusion, while halting its DEI 2.0 Strategic Plan.

Some public universities pull back on Juneteenth festivities
Juneteenth, celebrated annually on June 19, commemorates the date in 1865 when union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas and announced more than 250,000 enslaved Black people were free by executive decree. While the Emancipation Proclamation had taken effect more than two and half years prior, the order was not implemented in several places under Confederate control.
Juneteenth has been a federal holiday since 2021, and was celebrated in Michigan as an official state holiday for the first time in 2024. Although many state universities held panel discussions, showed documentaries, held workshops and spotlighted Black-owned businesses, there was a noticeable pull back among some universities this year, who either downsized from previous celebrations, or opted against celebrations entirely. 
While Northern Michigan University led festivities for the first time, and scheduled celebrations at Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Central Michigan University, Eastern Michigan University and Grand Valley State University looked similar to – or built upon – prior events, the University of Michigan’s celebration was notably smaller this year. 
In years past, the University’s Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives held a multi-day “Juneteenth Symposium” which included panel discussions, artistic performances and a Juneteenth Block Party in 2024. This year’s event was instead hosted by the University of Michigan Detroit Center, and featured two speakers focused on community resilience and local advocacy.

Brendan Kirwin, a spokesperson for the Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives, confirmed that they would not be hosting the symposium in 2025. When asked why the office had opted against hosting the event this year, Kirwin said the office was making some changes to its focus, and other offices the university is stepping into for the time being to assist.  
Juneteenth celebrations at Western Michigan University have looked different year to year, with the Black Graduate Student Association co-hosting events in 2021 leading up to, on and following the holiday. In 2022, the association hosted a Juneteenth Gala, while the university’s Merze Tate College hosted a Juneteenth cookout in 2023 and 2024. 
However in 2025, no events were listed on the university calendar. In a June 17 email, Paula Davis, Western Michigan’s associate vice president for strategic communications, said she did not know if the university was hosting any events. In a follow up email on June 20, Davis said as far as she knew, no events had been held or were planned. 
Michigan Technological University leadership in April discussed a number of policy changes brought on by the executive orders, including phasing out the Center for Diversity and Inclusion and moving its staff to new roles at the Center for Student Support and Mentorship. According to the Daily Mining Gazette, Vice President of Student Affairs Laura Bulleit assured panel attendees that Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth celebrations will still take place as long as they remain federal holidays.
While the university held events commemorating Juneteenth in 2023 and 2024, none were listed on the university’s event calendar for this year. University communications did not respond to multiple emails asking whether the university had any celebrations planned.

Part of a national trend
Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education said their members had seen a “troubling” trend of institutions scaling back or entirely eliminating academic or social support programs, including celebratory events. 
As far as why universities are scaling back, Granberry Russell referenced the demonization of the DEI acronym by conservatives and pointed to comments Trump made on Juneteenth where he declared in a post to his social media site that the nation has “too many non-working holidays.”
“Why choose Juneteenth, you know? And we’ll see if, if there’s something akin to that, if the Fourth of July falls on what is otherwise a working day,” Granberry Russell said. “I doubt very seriously that there will be criticism leveled against the Fourth of July as Independence Day.”
As part of the dilemma for universities concerning Trump’s executive orders, Granberry Russell noted the orders refer to programs such as “illegal DEI” and “radical and wasteful DEI” without offering any definition. 
The association, with the American Association of University Professors and other groups, is challenging those orders in court, arguing they unlawfully restrict speech, exceed presidential authority, and obstruct Congress’ constitutional power over government funding.
“The executive orders that we have challenged, for example, by President Trump, are intentionally vague and misleading, and I think as a result you’re leaving institutions in a state of ambiguity,” Granberry Russell said.
The executive orders, as well as prior anti-diversity initiative laws implemented in various states and others that have been introduced, are making it difficult for universities to determine what is permissible and what may trigger a lawsuit, Granberry Russell said.
While federal holidays serve as an opportunity to celebrate and commemorate events such as the end of slavery in the United States, that designation can also be seen as permission for universities to mark an event without a threat of that event being categorized as an illegal or wasteful DEI effort, Granberry Russell said.

However, celebrations can be held as a token gesture rather than an authentic acknowledgement, which is sometimes the case with federal holidays, Granberry Russell said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion programming and policies, alongside university celebrations, are a way of honoring the lived experiences and contributions different identity groups or communities have made to our democracy, Granberry Russell noted.
However, the pushback against these policies has isolated certain lived experiences based on gender, race or sexuality, deeming them wasteful or radical, Granberry Russell said.
She noted that it required the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the country to begin to move toward fairness and equal opportunity, Title IX to acknowledge that gender should not be a barrier to opportunities and pointed to the Americans With Disabilities Act as another law aiming to remove barriers and protect disabled individuals.
“These laws and celebrations and acknowledgements are intended to say, more broadly, you belong here. You are welcome here. We’re going to remove barriers and obstacles to your lived experiences. You should have the right to excel on your merit. That’s what this is all about,” Granberry Russell said.
While things may have started with opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, the outrage has extended far beyond those programs, calling the value of higher education into question, Granberry Russell said.
Eliminating programming that honors communities whose contributions were often left out of history is not a neutral step, and can be interpreted as forgetting about the contributions and sacrifices these communities have made, Granberry Russell said.
“We do have to ask ourselves, in higher education, what kind of learning community we cultivate when we choose silence over celebration?… This is not progress and it is not honoring the history and the lived experiences of those who have contributed to this country,” Granberry Russell said.

In NAACP v. Alabama, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the state could not compel the NAACP to release its membership lists. 
The lawsuit arose out of a lawsuit filed by Alabama Attorney General John M. Patterson, who claimed the civil rights organization had harmed the state’s reputation by promoting the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the admission of Autherine Lucy to the University of Alabama. 
Justices wrote that requiring the NAACP to turn over membership lists would violate the First Amendment, which promises the freedom of association. 
“It is hardly a novel perception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute as effective a restraint on freedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action,” the justices wrote. In the past, such exposures had led to members suffering “economic reprisals, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion and other manifestations of public hostility,” the justices wrote.

These are two of the most powerful people in the nation, with a responsibility to our state and an unparalleled opportunity to improve the lives of nearly 5.2 million Alabamians.
And what are they doing with that power?
Debasing themselves in public worship of a man with a bottomless sense of victimhood and a thoroughly selfish view of the world and those in it.
Of course, it’s no secret that Britt, Tuberville and almost every Alabama Republican gush over Trump and attack his enemies with the fervor of a Justin Bieber fan on Twitter in 2009. The median Republican position is that the president is infallible in word and deed.
That belief means embracing Trump’s fantasies. And prioritizing them over the needs of Alabama.
It’s not just Tuberville praising a military deployment against largely peaceful protestors holding “non-American flags.” Or Britt cheering as Trump attacks the federal department that feeds a lot of children in poverty in Alabama.
Just look at this congressional budget bill, looming over us like an avalanche.
They call it the “big beautiful bill” because Republicans never contest Trump’s perceptions of reality. Big, certainly, but not beautiful. The legislation contains provisions that are likely to do major damage to health care in the state and make it harder for hundreds of thousands of Alabamians to get food.
Tuberville has expressed some mild concern over cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the bill, less for the effect it could have on 752,000 Alabamians who depend on it for food than the costs Trump has proposed shifting to state government, which Tuberville would like to lead in about two years. Britt on Sunday said that would encourage states to put “skin in the game.” I don’t think a Legislature that refused federal aid to expand Medicaid can be trusted to do what Washington won’t.
But neither Tuberville nor Britt appear overly concerned over the bill’s broader rollback of health care provisions. The legislation proposes cutting over $820 million in state funding for Medicaid, which covers about 20% of Alabama’s population, most of them children, the elderly or those with disabilities.
That will curtail health care access, particularly in rural areas where hospitals are already struggling to survive and health care providers are few and far between. Nor does the bill extend enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of the year that give 170,000 Alabamians access to Affordable Care Act plans. All of this will mean less preventive care; sicker people; more emergency room visits, and greater strain on state hospitals.
The administration is also cutting billions of dollars in grants from the National Institutes of Health, money that supports institutions like the University of Alabama Birmingham, the state’s largest employer. Britt has signaled some unease about that, but the most she’s done is get HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — not someone whose word can be trusted — to mildly praise the work done at UAB. The administration shows no signs of backing off the cuts.
Neither Britt nor Tuberville seem interested in confronting Trump over any of this. Their priority is keeping the president happy. Tuberville even adopts Trump’s dehumanizing rhetoric about immigrants.
But the president is never happy. His re-election campaign ran on conspiracy and fear-mongering. Trump sees invisible cabals out to get him at every corner. He posts angry screeds at the slightest criticism. And he surrounds himself with flatterers who only speak in superlatives.
Our senators have joined this fawning choir. At our expense.
They’ve made Trump’s priorities — the ceaseless aggrandizement of Donald Trump — their own. Our senators have little to show for their time in office than an affirmation of the president’s paranoia and delusions.
So we get U.S. senators calling a man who unleashed bombs a peacemaker. Who shrug as he plans a major assault on Alabama’s well-being.
But no praise chorus can reverse the reality of the suffering the bill will unleash. Or erase the memory of who was responsible.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Katie-Britt-Tommy-Tuberville-composite-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

HB 178, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, and SB 166, sponsored by Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, would have required public K-12 schools to display an 11-by-14-inch poster of the Ten Commandments in common areas and classrooms where American history is taught.
The House passed its version of the bill 81-11 on April 22, but it never received a final vote from the Senate. Kelley said in an interview Wednesday that he and Gidley will bring the legislation back next year as is.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I wished we could have gotten it through the legislature this past session,” Kelley said. “I think we had reached a point where we would have accomplished that.”
Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays. Federal courts have allowed the displays of the Ten Commandments in historical contexts in schools but not as religious or moral displays.
The Louisiana Legislature passed a law in 2024 which, unlike the bills in the Alabama Legislature, required the document to be displayed in all classrooms. A federal court ruled last week that the law is unconstitutional, and violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, prohibiting the government from establishing a state religion or favoring one religion over another.
Despite the difference in the Alabama law, senior counsel Keisha Russell with the First Liberty Institute, a law firm that specializes in “defending religious freedom,” said that if the bill passes next year, it will still be challenged in court and likely deemed unconstitutional. She said in an interview Wednesday that whatever happens to a potential Alabama law will depend on what happens with the Louisiana law.
“I think it’s going to rise or fall based on what happens in this particular case with Louisiana, because the bills are pretty similar no matter what,” she said.
Kelley said he is not worried about an Alabama law being challenged in court, mostly because his legislation does not mandate the display in every classroom and because the intent is the historical context of the biblical text.
“I think ours is sticking with historical content, and so I think we’ll be fine with what we put together and the changes that we’ve made,” Kelley said.
A’Niya Robinson, policy and organizing director of the Alabama American Civil Liberties Union, said the ACLU has been opposed to the legislation from the beginning. She said that because the Ten Commandments is derived from religious text, it is inherently religious, not historical.
“I think that’s a really interesting argument to make, to allege that a document that has text that’s found in the Bible, in some folks’ Bible, is supposedly not religious,” Robinson said in an interview Thursday. 
Russell said that requiring the text to be displayed where history is taught would require the text to be in every elementary school classroom and some middle and high school classrooms.
“It’s still going to be virtually everywhere, right? Common areas, lunchrooms, all of that,” Russell said. “I think there’s a better argument to say you’re going to put it in all the classrooms than to say that you’re just going to stick it in like the locker room or the lunchroom, which is a common area. To me, that has less sort of academic value than if it’s in the classroom.”
Robinson said the location of a poster does not make its presence any more constitutional.
“There is still a captive audience there,” she said. “They have to go to school, they have to be in classrooms, and they still are going to have to look and see that poster every day if this bill were to be signed into law.”
Opponents of the legislation argued during public hearings that the version of the Ten Commandments in the bill combines multiple versions of the text and is not historical.
“This bill is a violation of the First Amendment and imposes a certain religious understanding of a certain text that has been hodged-podged together and linguistically abused and has no place in our public schools,” Rev. Julie Conrady, a minister with the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham, said in March.
 Kelley said Wednesday that the intent of the bill was manipulated to be religious, and that his intent is solely historical and based on the founding of American law and the Constitution.
“It’s just the manipulation of what the intention is, of what the words are by others is where the conflict comes in,” he said. “Anybody that has learned history from an early age, they learned how it’s influenced us.”
Robinson said that the first amendment was inspired by the founders’ belief that religion should be separate from government.
“If we want to talk about historical importance, then I think it’s important to go back to the founders’ original intent,” she said. “There’s so many different versions of the Ten Commandments depending on what particular faith or translation you subscribe to. So by only posting one version of the Ten Commandments in classrooms, then really you could say that politicians have crafted their own version of the Ten Commandments, and they’re trying to impose it on public school students throughout Alabama.”

Wes Moore is ambextrous must come in handy. Here he is signing with his left hand in his first bill signing in 2023. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Of the 300 bills with July 1 effective dates that were signed into law this year, most attention — and aggravation — will be focused on just one, the Budget Reconciliation and Finance Act of 2025, a 200-page bill that raises $2 billion in fiscal 2026 through a combination of new taxes and spending cuts.
And most attention in the bill that goes by its shorthand, BRFA, will be focused on a new a 3% tax increase on the sale of many informational technology services, which alone is expected to raise more than $480 million in new revenue that will help the state close a $3 billion budget hole it found itself in at the start of the year.
The bill also includes new, higher income tax rates for the highest earners and allows local government to increase the amount of income tax they collect. It also includes taxes on cannabis sales, mobile sports wagering and vehicle emissions inspections, among many others.
But the bulk of the new laws are not about dollars and cents. Also starting Tuesday are changes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s decade-long education reform plan; an expansion of solar-power siting options; a sweeping Chesapeake Bay cleanup bill; and a program to allow state funds to be used for abortions for uninsured and underinsured state residents.
The taxman cometh
For the first time, technology companies will have to pay a sales tax on their services. The tax, originally proposed as a 2.5% business-t0-business tax, was expanded to a 3% on all sales, money that supporters say is needed to head off funding cuts to critical programs in the state.
But critics say the tax — expected to raise $483 million in its first year, growing to $747 million by fiscal 2030 – is a job killer that will drive businesses out of the state. In floor debate on the House floor this spring, Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), the vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, took the remarkable step of announcing that he was relocating his tech business outside the state because of the tax.
The tax will apply to a range of services: cloud storage, data entry, data processing, media streaming data storage and technical support, telephone-based recorded information services, cryptocurrency mining, news and press clipping services, media archives such as for film and music, computer software design services, and dozens more.
Comptroller’s Office issues guidance to help businesses brace for 3% ‘tech tax’

Affiliated companies would not have to pay the tax among themselves, and the law exempts emerging technology companies located in the “Discovery District” in College Park. It also exempts companies such as IonQ and companies that do business with a developer of quantum computing technology, an industry that Gov. Wes Moore (D) has targeted for development as part of his efforts to diversify the state’s economy.
The tech tax is the biggest single in the BRFA, but it’s far from the only one. The new law also:

Creates two new upper-end tax brackets and increases the tax on them from 5.75% to 6.5%, while increasing the standard deduction from $2,500 to $3,350 ($6,700 for joint filers and some others), which is expected to bring in $344 million;
Allow local governments to raise their income tax from the current maximum of 3.2% of reported state income tax — the rate currently assessed by 18 of the state’s 24 jurisdictions — to 3.3%;
Raises the tax on mobile sports wagering from 15% to 20%;
Expedites the phase-in of higher vehicle excise taxes;
Increases the cannabis sales tax from 9% to 12%;
And raises the vehicle emissions inspection fee cap from $14 to $30.

The bill also allows the imposition of a $5 fee on the sale of new tires, to help support the Transportation Trust Fund, but that tax will not be assessed until Jan. 1, 2026.
New funding for abortion grants
A new law allows the Maryland Department of Health to release millions of dollars in unspent insurance funds that it hopes to use to fund abortions for uninsured and underinsured Marylanders.
Senate Bill 848 and House Bill 930 create the Public Health Abortion Grant Program, which will be used to help cover abortion costs for uninsured or underinsured Marylanders. The grant program will use $25 million that have been collected in premium surcharges that are required as part of the federal Affordable Care Act but have not been spent down.
That money is the $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy, to fund abortion services for their policyholders. But that fund has been growing by about $3 million a year, as collections have outpaced need.
Under this law, providers will receive the grant funds for providing abortion services for people who do not have insurance or whose health insurance does not cover abortions. While the law goes into effect July, the fund to create the grant program will not be established until September.
Solar bill powers up
Beginning Tuesday, local governments will have less say in the siting of large-scale solar fields, under a law that changes how Maryland regulates solar energy sites.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The law undoes restrictive zoning laws passed in several counties and sets uniform environmental standards for solar farm construction, including rules requiring buffers of trees and shrubs, and limiting the disturbance of topsoil.
The Renewable Energy Certainty Act was part of a three-bill energy package sponsored by Democratic leadership, who said it aimed to prevent solar developers from getting caught in a confusing tangle of local regulations, and stimulate the growth of desirable renewable energy.
It passed over Republicans’ protests, particularly that the bill would leave valuable agricultural lands vulnerable to solar development. The bill does set a 5% limit on solar development in pre-existing agricultural “priority preservation areas,” but opponents argue that that percentage still has the potential to disrupt fragile local farming economies.
An effort by opponents, largely farmers, to challenge the bill by referendum fell just short of the petition signature requirement.
With the bill taking effect, many local jurisdictions are scrambling to update their regulations about solar, said Dominic Butchko, the director of intergovernmental relations at the Maryland Association of Counties, in a recent interview, checking to make sure their local laws mesh with the state’s new policy and aren’t any more restrictive.
The quick turnaround time for counties to fix their laws before the state solar bill takes effect might create some “bumps” in the road, Butchko said, but he said any loose ends are likely to be tied up in the months ahead.
“The counties can go less extreme than what was outlined in the legislation. They just can’t go more extreme, and so jurisdictions are going to have to go through the bill and just make sure that whatever they have on the books really aligns with that,” Butchko said.
The Blueprint
Three years into the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the 10-year schools education reform plan gets some tweaks in the the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, which takes effect Tuesday.
One major part of the Blueprint deals with the implementation of “collaborative time,” which provides teachers more out-of-classroom time to plan and work with each other on various subjects and also assess student achievement. School systems are supposed to start implementing collaborative time next year.
But state school leaders have said that to fully implement collaborative time, they would need to hire at least 12,000 new teachers at a time when the state faces a teacher shortage.
The law taking effect Tuesday pauses the policy requirement for collaborative time for three years, but keeps the funding amount at $163 per student for next fiscal year. It would stay at that level until fiscal 2029, when it would jump to $334 per student.
Local school officials and advocates have expressed repeated frustration in implementing the Blueprint plan. In December, the Public School Superintendents’ Association of Maryland released a report that included a recommendation to clarify roles between state Board of Education and Accountability and Implementation Board, which oversees the Blueprint. That recommendation bore fruit last week, when the two boards approved an agreement that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each.
But some Republican lawmakers and education advocates already say they are going to continue to push for more Blueprint reforms when the General Assembly returns in January.
¡Si, ellos pueden!
Thousands more Marylanders are expected to be able to take the General Educational Development test, also known as the GED, for the equivalent of a high school diploma, now that the test will be offered in Spanish as well as English.
Senate Bill 451 sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) and House Bill 325 sponsored by Del. Greg Wims (D-Montgomery) will allow individuals to take the exam at least twice a year at locations throughout the state. Wims said earlier this year Maryland was the only state to publish the test in English only.
In written testimony on the measures, the department said slightly more than 9,000 people whose primary language was Spanish enrolled in programs it offered in 2023-24. Of those individuals, approximately 4,177, or 46%, did not have a high school diploma.
The new law comes as President Donald Trump (R) has issued an executive order making English the official language of the U.S. and rescincing a 2000 executive order signed by then-President Bill Clinton (D) that directed federal agencies and organizations receiving federal funding to improve access to services for those are with limited English proficiency.
The U.S. has never had an official language, and it’s unclear what effect Trump’s order can have, absent legislation. According to a June 3 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, about 22% of people in the U.S. age 5 and older spoke a language other than English between 2017 to 2021.
The law also requires the state Department of Labor, which administers the GED tests, to study whether the test can be offered in other languages besides English and Spanish. Those recommendations must be submitted to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees by Dec. 1, 2026.
FBI funding
Speaking of pushing back against Trump, House Bill 1078 sponsored by Prince George’s Democratic Dels. Nicole Williams, Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez directs the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”
The proposed new FBI site in Greenbelt was chosen in November 2023 by the General Services Administration as the next home for the FBI headquarters and its 7,500 employees.
But on the same day the House approved the measure in March, Trump said he would stop plans to build the new FBI headquarters in Maryland, noting that it’s a blue state and claiming that the Greenbelt site is “three hours away” from the agency’s current site at 935 Pennsylvania Ave. NW in Washington. The Greenbelt site is about actually 16 miles from the D.C. location.
The GSA had two other finalists for the FBI site, one in Landover, also in Prince George’s County, and another in Springfield, Virginia.
Virginia representatives claim the process to select Maryland was flawed, especially after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process — but not with the Greenbelt site.
FBI Director Kash Patel said last month about 1,500 employees would be transferred to other locations nationwide, but did not mention a site for a new headquarters.
Young adult health care subsidies extended
Young people buying health insurance on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace will continue to see savings on their monthly premiums, thanks to the new law that eliminates the expiration date for the State-Based Young Adult Health Insurance Subsidies Pilot Program.
The current program aims to help low-income Marylanders between the ages of 18 and 37 afford individual health plans through state-funded subsidies, taking an average of $40 off of their monthly insurance premiums. Those savings range depending on the individual’s financial situation.
Officials say that the subsidies have led to an increase in enrollment from this age group, which helps create a healthier insurance pool all around and lower rates for everyone. With the new law under House Bill 297 and Senate Bill 5, those savings will be permanent, so long as the state has funding to support the subsidies.
Establishing a disability employment initiative
One of the governor’s priority bills, to help give people with disabilities greater access to employment opportunities, will launch in July.
House Bill 502 establishes the Office of Disability Employment Advancement and Policy. The new office will explore strategies to improve employment, training and care-readiness of people with disabilities.
The office will also implement the “Maryland as a Model Employer Initiative” which will help connect people with disabilities to jobs and promote career advancement for those individuals. The office will also report data on the success of those effort to the governor and the General Assembly starting next December and every year after.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC_0368-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

Joe Lombardo made righting Nevada’s economy a focus of his gubernatorial campaign. Now, as he begins his quest for re-election in 2026, critics contend he has failed to fulfill two central promises – to make housing more affordable and to lower the unemployment rate.
Lombardo’s policies on housing and employment often appear at odds with his goals, say observers.
“He has no intention of lowering rents or increasing availability of affordable housing, and that became apparent,” says Shelbie Swartz, executive director of Battle Born Progress, pointing to Lombardo’s enlistment of a Republican lawmaker to kill a measure that would have capped corporate investment in residential housing.
On the employment front, sacked with the highest jobless rate of any state for the last year, Lombardo pursued an anti-worker agenda, critics contend, including a veto of legislation that would have required paid family and medical leave for employees of some private companies.
The governor did not respond to numerous requests for comment for this story. 
 ‘Trickle-down housing’

Of a handful of bills championed by Lombardo this year, only two passed – an education reform measure and a housing act aimed at reducing demand across the spectrum by creating a new level of subsidized housing for buyers earning up to 150% of area median income (AMI).
Subsidized housing is currently reserved for individuals earning up to 80% of AMI, and in some cases up to 120%.
“It’s kind of like a trickle-down housing policy,” says Ben Iness of the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance. “Are middle-income folks those that need support the most? Are they in dire straits compared to our low income and extremely low income residents?”
The idea behind the policy is that more market-priced, ‘attainable’ homes will free up existing units for low and extremely-low income Nevadans, who have fewer choices than low-income Americans in any other state. 
“The trickle-down theory doesn’t work,” says Las Vegan Frank Hawkins, who has built thousands of low-income and affordable units in Nevada. “It’s like saying I’m gonna give you nothing and I’m gonna give you more of it, and sooner or later, you’re gonna have something.”
Yet, Hawkins, a former Las Vegas city councilman, is excited the law facilitates construction of properties for sale, rather than for rent, and is hopeful Lombardo’s plan will spur gentrification in distressed areas such as the Historic Westside, where dozens of vacant parcels are owned by the government, even if it’s unlikely developers will pursue the opportunities. 
“Builders want to be out in the suburbs,” he said. “And they want everything to be on new streets, for new people.” 
In Clark County, where the area median income for a household of four is estimated at $75,000, a buyer earning $112,000 would be eligible for Lombardo’s plan. The threshold would be slightly higher in Washoe County, where the AMI is $83,800. 
At that income level, a prospective buyer could qualify for a home valued at roughly $460,000.
The median price of a single family home in Clark County sold in May was $480,000, up from $425,000 when Lombardo took office in January 2023. The median price of a home sold in Reno was $595,000, up from $510,000 when Lombardo took office. Rent at both ends of the state is also up from when Lombardo became governor.  
The housing act was initially slated to cost $250 million and serve 16,000 households, but was scaled back to $133 million with a goal of creating 5,000 single-family homes.
Lombardo has access to other incentives that don’t require public funding, such as inclusionary zoning, a policy that requires developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new residential developments or pay into a fund that does the same. 
As a candidate, Lombardo, a free-market enthusiast, rejected proposals such as rent stabilization and inclusionary zoning. Instead, he said he’d “provide incentives and defer payments on land” to generate more affordable housing.
Supporters of Lombardo’s legislation reject the notion that it ignores the need in low- and extremely-low income markets. Nevada has 14 units for every 100 extremely-low income residents, the lowest level in the nation. Other programs, they note, such as federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), are doing the work to develop units at the low end of the market.  
“Nevada’s housing crunch is not limited to affordable units. It is a system-wide shortfall,” says Wally Swenson of Nevada HAND, which facilitates low-income housing development. “Families at every income level are competing for too few homes, which results in rising home prices, forcing more competition for both naturally occurring and purpose-built affordable housing.”
Middle-income buyers, Swenson says, are “edging out neighbors with lower incomes.”
While housing reserved for low-income residents is essential, building at every price point, he says, “is a sustainable strategy to address the downward pressure on affordable housing and support our growing communities.”
Ennis of the NHJA questions whether federal funding for low-income housing will fall victim to President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting. “It’s hard to suggest our state is immune from what’s happening nationally.”
The LIHTC program is not currently in jeopardy, In fact, both parties have voiced support for expansion of the credits.
While housing construction lagged growth in the decade from 2010 to 2019, a surplus of units built before the Great Recession has picked up the slack, say a chorus of experts who contend the housing shortage is manufactured.  
“Unfortunately, not enough of it is affordable, especially for low-income and very low-income families and individuals,” says Kirk McClure, a Kansas University professor who co-wrote a study published in the journal Housing Policy Debate.
Affordability challenges, he says, are a result of low incomes versus high housing prices, rather than a shortage.
“This condition suggests that we cannot build our way to housing affordability,” he says. “We need to address price levels and income levels to help low-income households afford the housing that already exists, rather than increasing the supply in the hope that prices will subside.”
Iness of NHJA agrees. Absent solutions for low wages, tenant protections, measures to keep rents in check, enforced habitability standards, and controls on corporate purchases of residential units, Lombardo’s policy, he says, seems superficial. 
 Giving away the house

Builders, who learned they can make higher profits by selling fewer homes, are not building much, and when they do, it’s not the multifamily units that are desperately needed, especially in Southern Nevada. In 2023, Reno and Sparks issued 15% more multi-family building permits than Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas combined, reports the Guinn Center for Policy Priorities.
Thanks to inflation, the high cost of capital, and the cost of materials, “a lot of projects just don’t pencil in anymore,” says Nicholas Irwin, research director at UNLV’s Lied Institute. “On those lower-income projects, the capital financing is just not there, or the cost of construction is just so high. Given a choice with a piece of land, developers know if they can get more of an upper-end of market distribution, that’s their target.”
Whether Lombardo’s effort frees up units that can be filled by low-income earners remains to be seen, says Irwin. “Whenever you expand eligibility, those programs are going to help get more people into housing. We don’t know if it’s going to be the people at the very low or upper distribution of that spread.”
Subsidies for affordable housing are designed to solve the resulting math problem when development doesn’t add up. Gap financing, low-income housing tax credits and other subsidies guarantee the project and its resulting below-market rents won’t be a drain on developers.
Until recently, such programs have been reserved for critical efforts to provide units for low and extremely low-income residents, who are often seniors and others on fixed incomes.
“What we’re seeing now is the markets underproviding middle-income housing as well,” says Irwin. “We need to build more housing of all types.” 
Irwin notes other states are using public money to incentivize developers. Colorado lawmakers are shoveling public money into housing projects targeting households earning as much $170,000 a year, the Colorado Sun reports. 
Legislative insiders suggest that politics, not policy, is the impetus for Lombardo’s housing gamble, which enhances the governor’s bona fides with voters, apart from any ties that may bind him to Trump.
He is expected to face off against Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat.
Six of eight Republican state senators voted against Lombardo’s housing bill, which had widespread support from Democratic lawmakers and passed unanimously in the Assembly.
 ‘An unusual twist’

On the campaign trail in 2022, Lombardo blamed then-Gov. Steve Sisolak for the state’s unemployment rate, and suggested it was under the governor’s control. 
Under Lombardo, the state has led all others with the highest unemployment rate in the nation for the last year, and the job growth rate is the fourth lowest in the nation. 
In his 2025 State of the State address, the governor noted that under his watch, a record 1.6 million Nevadans are on the job. “But in an unusual twist, Nevada’s unemployment rate stands at 5.7 percent – a number that reminds us there is still much work to be done.”
Lombardo acknowledges that, for the most part, his initiatives are intended to appeal to employers, not to the workers he seeks to enlist.
“Nevada has long prided itself on maintaining a business-friendly environment,” Lombardo said in his veto message of a bill that would have required businesses with more than 50 employees to provide 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. Current law requires 8 weeks of PFML leave, but only for state employees.
In two legislative sessions and in public appearances, Lombardo has eschewed worker-friendly policies, such as prevailing wage, a provision initially exempted from his housing bill, and he’s laid the blame for the state’s jobless rate on its residents.
‘We’re number one in job availability, but we’re number one in unemployment, you know why? Because they’re not quality jobs,” he said at a Republican gathering this year. “People would rather manipulate the government process and receive unemployment or to sit at home versus occupying a job that’s available that doesn’t see their family moving forward.”
Lombardo’s economic development bill contained a rare pro-worker initiative that would have provided transferable tax credits to help finance a new or expanding child care facility for up to five years. It went nowhere in Carson City.
His efforts to diversify the economy have “brought $5 billion in economic development into the state,” he told a Republican gathering in April. His Office of Economic Development notes 41 companies have made $6.7 billion in capital investment during his term. More than half of the investment – $3.6 billion – is from Tesla, Inc., which had a footprint in the state before Lombardo took office.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NZ65871-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

But what does that phrase mean?","On May 30, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a list of over 500 cities, counties and states it designated as “sanctuary” jurisdictions. The state of Connecticut itself, plus six of its towns, were on the now-deleted list.
Some local representatives were surprised to see their municipalities on the list. Others were not.
The term “sanctuary city” is controversial because it has no official legal definition, but it generally refers to jurisdictions limiting their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.  
Here’s what you need to know about sanctuary cities and Connecticut officials’ reaction to the DHS designation.
What are sanctuary cities?
According to Global Refuge, a nonprofit that helps people settle in the U.S., sanctuary cities have policies that set boundaries on what information or support local or state governments provide to federal immigration authorities. 
The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, classifies a sanctuary jurisdiction as “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.”
Sanctuary cities are often in areas with large immigrant populations, according to the national organization Vera Institute of Justice.
According to the American Immigration Council, some so-called “sanctuary policies” can include actions like: limiting the ability of local or state police to “arrest or detain people for federal civil immigration violations;” prohibiting cooperation agreements like 287(g), which allow ICE to deputize local officers; preventing local staff from asking about immigration status or restricting what information can be shared with federal agencies.
What Connecticut towns were on the list?
The towns of East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford and Hamden were included in DHS’s list. The state of Connecticut itself was also named a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The Department of Homeland Security did not provide an explanation as to why these towns in Connecticut were specifically cited or what the criteria were for being added to the list. It also did not provide an explanation as to why the list was taken down.
Of the municipalities on the list, only Hartford and Windham have enacted resolutions calling themselves sanctuary cities, while New Haven and Hamden have designated themselves as “Welcoming Cities” instead. 
In a statement, the Town of East Haven said that they were inaccurately named on the list. “Let us be clear: the Town of East Haven was never informed of this designation by any federal agency, nor do we agree with it,” the statement said.
“The classification issued by the Department of Homeland Security was not only absurd — it is baseless,” East Haven Mayor Joseph A. Carfora said. “Before the page was removed, my administration followed up with DHS to demand clarification and to understand how such an unfounded statement was made without any consultation or communication with our office. We will not allow East Haven to be mischaracterized without accountability.”
But New Haven and Windham officials also said they never received notification of their inclusion on the list. “Windham has a large Latino population and it’s well known the present [federal] administration targets poor communities as we have limited resources,” Mayor Thomas DeVivo said. 
New London Mayor Michael Passero said he does not know the definition of a sanctuary city.
“I can only tell you that New London has never declared itself a sanctuary city,” he said.
What are the town’s policies on immigration enforcement?
Not every town calls itself a sanctuary city, but they all have policies that deal with immigration in some way.
In New Haven, Mayor Justin Elicker signed a Welcoming City executive order in 2020, affirming “the city’s commitment to ensuring residents feel safe accessing public services.” 
The directive bars city employees from inquiring about or revealing a person’s immigration status unless mandated by state or federal law. Elicker said in a press conference last month that New Haven does not obstruct justice. He said the city’s welcoming policies make the community safer by encouraging people to report crimes, seek health care, and send their children to school without fear.
“This is something we expected, and we are proud of it,” he said in a press conference, referring to New Haven’s inclusion on the sanctuary city list. “New Haven is proudly a welcoming city… Our immigrant community is part of our New Haven family.”
East Haven’s policy is that since immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government, the East Haven Police Department generally does not participate in ICE operations except “when formally requested as part of an on-going criminal investigation, or from notifying those federal officials in serious situations where a threat to public safety or national security is perceived.” 
The Hartford Code of Ordinances does officially declare Hartford a “sanctuary city.” The local laws state that all residents of Hartford, regardless of their immigration status, have equal access to city services and referrals to medical or social agencies. This policy does not restrict city employees from cooperating with federal immigration authorities when legally required.  
Hamden’s policies limit local police involvement in federal immigration enforcement. Officers can’t ask about immigration status unless it’s tied to a criminal investigation, and cannot question victims or witnesses about their status. They also may not arrest or detain individuals based only on civil detainers or administrative warrants, except as required by state law. Town resources, including police and school staff, cannot be used to assist ICE unless mandated by state statute or a federal judge’s order.
New London has shared on its town website the Family Preparedness Plan, Preparing Your Family for Immigration Enforcement. This is a statewide document that has information for families concerned about immigration enforcement, not specific to New London. 
The New London Police Department prohibits officers from asking about immigration status unless it directly relates to a criminal investigation, according to a local executive order. Officers are also not allowed to detain or question individuals only based on suspected immigration violations, but the policy states local police may assist federal authorities if requested.
Windham became a sanctuary city following a 2017 resolution that passed unanimously. The resolution reaffirmed its commitment to protecting all residents, including undocumented immigrants who contribute to the community. It also states that no town official or “personnel” shall arrest, detain or report a person based only on immigration or citizenship status except due to a valid criminal warrant, or to comply with a civil immigration detainer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP_Hartford_skyline-1024x629.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

WOLF LAKE. Ill. — Standing on the edge of a 300-foot limestone bluff in southern Illinois’ Shawnee National Forest, Machaela Sweeney could thank the perfect words she typed into ChatGPT for bringing her to the unexpected spot.

“I literally looked up lush, magical, fairytale areas,” she recalled, looking over the edge of the forest’s Inspiration Point Trail.

A 30-year-old social worker from Hopkinsville, Kentucky, Sweeney was looking for a destination to recover from burnout. The AI app recommended two destinations: North Carolina or southern Illinois.

The first recommendation didn’t surprise her. Sweeney said that many people in Kentucky go to the Great Smoky Mountains when they want to get away. But she had never heard anyone talk about the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois before.

“So this almost feels like a hidden gem,” Sweeney said. “If somebody was going to the Smokies all the time and they were tired of it, I would say, ‘Try mixing it up.’”

The forest stretches across the eastern and western parts of southern Illinois, from Inspiration Point Trail overlooking the Mississippi River Valley here in the west to the popular Garden of the Gods wilderness area in Herod to the east.

Sweeney is among the growing number of visitors discovering southern Illinois as a travel destination amid a recent effort to entice more people to visit for the summer season.

Carol Hoffman, executive director of the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau, said the primary draws to southern Illinois are the outdoor recreation activities in Shawnee National Forest, including hiking, cycling, rock climbing and ziplining, as well as another Illinois surprise linked to the unusual terrain: vineyards and five wine trails.

The bureau has appealed to riders of the Chicago Transit Authority with a recent signage campaign that invited potential travelers to “go where the bus won’t take you” and to “come see our skyscrapers.”

In addition to plastering photos of lush greenery and rocky bluffs across Chicago buses and train stops, the bureau has paid to have promotional mailers, exhibits, shows and content creator posts that promote tourism to Illinois’ southern region.

Southern tourism bureaus have been tapping into a trend of high visitor spending in Illinois in recent years, exceeding pre-pandemic numbers for the first time in 2023, according to the most recent available data from a 2024 report prepared for the Illinois Office of Tourism.

More than $80 billion in economic impact

In 2023, tourists spent over $47 billion across Illinois, creating nearly 450,000 new jobs and generating over $6.5 billion in state and local taxes, according to the 2024 Tourism Office report. The report estimated that tourism in that year generated over $80 billion in total economic impact for the state.

Travel tourism influencer Jessica Baine, 35, has worked on tourism promotions with the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau and Jackson County’s Southern Illinois Tourism bureau for more than two years.

Baine, a Carterville nurse practitioner raised in southern Illinois, said she regularly receives messages from viewers online who were surprised by the content she shared, telling her, “I had no idea that southern Illinois looked like that.”

Hoffman’s group aims to connect with people within “an easy day’s drive,” typically those within a three- to six-hour driving distance from the forest, such as those living in central and southern Illinois and in the St. Louis metro area.

The advertising campaign is just one in a series of projects seeking to boost tourism in the area in recent years. The industry has seen a more than twofold increase in funding since 2023, with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, or DCEO, giving out over $9 million in grants to boost tourism in the southern part of the state.

That money was distributed to cities and tourism bureaus across the southern half of the state for the last fiscal year, from Alton and Mattoon down to Metropolis, the officially designated home of Superman, where fans can take photos with a 15-foot statue of the comic book hero.

Past Illinois tourism campaigns have paid major returns. In the 2023 fiscal year, every dollar invested in promoting tourism generated $75 in direct visitor spending, according to the 2023 – 2024 Economic Impact of Tourism report by the DCEO Office of Tourism.





Grant funds are matched by local hotels and motels hoping to bring travelers in, according to Hoffman.

In some cases, lodging is the attraction itself. According to Lyle and Tammy Woodrum, the married innkeepers of the Davie School Inn in Anna, Illinois, a fifth of their guests come just for the experience of staying in a former schoolhouse.

Originally built in 1853 as a school, the Davie School Inn was repurposed as a bed and breakfast, but still looks in many ways like a school, with various rooms featuring desks, globes and chalkboards covered with messages from past guests.

Susan Hill traveled from her home in Memphis to stay at the Davie School Inn last month. She said she’s done it a handful of times since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she was looking for somewhere to stay where she could sit outside.

According to Hill, the novelty of staying in an old school was a draw. “It’s like, heck yeah, come on,” she said. “It's just really quaint. I feel safe there.”

The Woodrums said most of their guests have come for the area’s local attractions, primarily the Shawnee Hills Wine trail and outdoor activities in the Shawnee National Forest but also for family and college reunions.

‘Wine just likes us’

Shawnee Hills Wine Trail is the largest of the state’s five trails, comprising 12 wineries and 13 locations. It originated in the summer of 1995, when owners of the first three wineries in southern Illinois — Alto Vineyards, Pomona Winery and Owl Creek Vineyard — worked with the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau and the Carbondale Convention and Tourism Bureau to start the first wine trail in Illinois.

Maggie Pugh, assistant manager at Feather Hills Vineyard on Highway 51, said the campaign to attract tourists to the region has had a real effect on the winery. Recently, the company ran out of three of its bestselling — and most bottled — wines, which, to her, is an indicator of increased visitor flow.

“I think we are getting busier. I think the advertising has worked,” she said. “I also know that the Wine Trail is doing quite a lot to try and bring more people down, because part of the problem is, this area isn't taken seriously for wine — although it should be.”

Illinois is the second-flattest state on the nation’s mainland, seemingly perfect only for corn. But Pugh described the Shawnee Hills region — home to many of Illinois’ highest elevations — as a “little golden nugget” in which “wine (is) just likes us, grapes enjoy our soil.”

Since 2015, wineries on the trail have won over 30 medals in national and international wine competitions. Although the vineyards are geographically close together, scattered across an area of 40 miles, the trail boasts a wide range of wines, Pugh said.

“The coolest part about southern Illinois is that even a winery that’s only 20 minutes away from this location right here, our wine is going to taste vastly different, even if we made it the exact same way,” she said. “Our grapes don’t taste the same because of the elevation, and you get those slight hints that might make or break a wine for you.”

‘Illinois’ most hippie town’

Award-winning wines and breathtaking vistas aren’t the only unexpected finds in southern Illinois.

Makanda, a short drive from the Southern Illinois University campus in Carbondale, features a boardwalk of shops by local artists. Artists sell jewelry, gemstones, sage for burning, paintings, intricate metalwork and more. The tiny village of fewer than 550 people, a short drive from SIU, proudly calls itself “Illinois’s most hippie” town.

Nina Kovar is one of those artists. In her Visions Art Gallery, dream catchers are hung along the front window, inviting shoppers to come browse clothing, jewelry and handmade ceramics.

Kovar said she sees graduates coming back for homecoming again and again, as well as others who are discovering the town for the first time after hearing about its hippie reputation.

“There’s a certain timeless element to it,” Kovar said of Makanda. “The creativity that we have, that a lot of us are artists and artisans and crafters, that it's kind of nestled in nature; it’s beautiful.”

Kovar said she has seen a significant increase in tourism to Makanda since the COVID-19 pandemic, with people not flying as much, but also wanting to get out of the house and into the outdoors.

Makanda also made it onto the map, Kovar said, because of the total solar eclipse that took place on April 8, 2024. A few shops down from Kovar, artist Dave Dardis painted a line through his shop to represent the path of totality at the time.

Dardis is better known as the Rainmaker, a name he shares with his bronze art studio. A backdoor in Dardis’ shop opens out to his secret garden, a poorly kept secret in Makanda.

The garden features lush greenery and natural elements interwoven with bronze sculptures. Sweeney, a self-described whimsical person, said her visit to Dardis’ not-so-secret garden was the best part of her southern Illinois experience.

“That’s like walking into a literal fairy tale,” Sweeney said. “He’s like a hermit slash hippie slash, I don’t know, man with wisdom,” Sweeney added of Dardis. “He almost reminds me of a sage, like, you know those giant trees that talk?”

Having grown up in the area, tourism influencer Baine is well aware of the traditional engines for local economies — whether that’s coal mining or agriculture. But she sees a path for tourism to become an even bigger factor in time.

“There’s coal mines and there’s all these very blue-collar jobs, but tourism brings even more money to our region. Tourists are spending money at restaurants, at the wineries, and they can reinvest in our communities,” Baine said.

“When you live and breathe southern Illinois, and your kid goes to school here,” she said, “you want these businesses to thrive.”

But they don’t solve all the problems that vehicle owners have raised.,"This article was produced in partnership with ProPublica through its Local Reporting Network. Sign up for our newsletter to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.
A Hartford woman never saw her car again after it was towed while she sat in housing court fighting an eviction.
A home care worker had her car towed while she hurried to assist a patient down the stairs. 
A young man lost his car and slipped into financial instability after he mistakenly put his apartment’s parking sticker in the wrong spot.
Late last month, Connecticut lawmakers, following a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica, passed sweeping reforms to the state’s towing laws that will address many of the issues drivers have complained about. The stories highlighted how towing companies can begin the process to sell people’s cars after 15 days, one of the shortest windows in the country.
Reporters heard from dozens of drivers across Connecticut who had to pay exorbitant fees or had their vehicles sold when they couldn’t afford the charges. Many told reporters about the severe consequences they experienced after their cars were towed or sold, including the loss of jobs, personal mementos and housing.
While some people’s cars might not have been towed under the new law, which takes effect Oct. 1, it doesn’t solve all the problems that vehicle owners raised.
Here are some of their stories, as well as whether the changes in the new law would have helped them.
Towing Home Health Aides
Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.
Home care worker Maria Jiménez circled the Hartford apartment complex for low-income seniors, looking for a place to park. Jiménez drives patients to and from errands like doctor’s appointments and grocery shopping. Her patient that day last November used a cane, and Jiménez planned to park close so that her patient wouldn’t have to walk too far.
Unsuccessful, Jiménez stopped in front of the building’s entrance. 
“I turned on the hazard lights and left the car on, just long enough to let her know I had arrived, since I didn’t have her phone number,” she said. Jiménez said she told a few bystanders she would be right back and asked them to keep an eye on her car. 
She said she went inside only briefly, and when she returned, the car was gone. Bystanders told Jiménez the car had been towed and that they’d pleaded with the truck’s driver, to no avail.
Tracy Wodatch, president and CEO at Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home, said many of her members complain about getting ticketed or towed when they’re doing their jobs helping people.
When it happens frequently enough at a particular complex, she said, an agency might speak with the landlord to ask for a designated spot. But there isn’t a statewide mandate.
New Jersey passed a law in 2018 allowing home health care workers, visiting nurses and others to apply for a placard similar to an accessible parking tag to place in their cars.
“Maybe we can talk to the legislators off session to see if there’s anything we can do,” Wodatch said.
The company that towed Jiménez, MyHoopty.com, was in Watertown, and Jiménez was stranded over 30 miles away in Hartford. “How will I get there if I don’t have a car?” she recalled thinking.
MyHoopty owner Michael Festa said the vehicle was parked in the fire lane without its hazard lights on for 17 minutes before it was towed and that the apartment complex had hired MyHoopty to prevent such parking violations.  
“This is a critical safety issue, particularly at an elderly housing complex where the emergency access can be a matter of life and death,” Festa said. (MyHoopty has appeared in other stories in our series.)
The apartment complex owners didn’t respond to calls and emails for comment. 
Jiménez said she makes about $290 a week. By the time she got to MyHoopty, the company told her the bill was more than $400.
Her husband footed the bill. But it wasn’t easy: “The only reason I could afford it is because I work mornings, I work nights,” he said.
Short Meters and Unpaid Tickets
Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.
Marie Franklin paid the parking meter and dashed into Hartford housing court for a December 2023 hearing that would determine if she would get evicted from her apartment. She worried about the parking. People can wait for hours for the judge to call their cases, but the Hartford Parking Authority limits nearby meters to two hours.
So people facing eviction sometimes run the risk of getting a parking violation, getting their cars towed or missing their names being called for hearings, which can cause them to lose their housing in a default judgement for not showing up to court.
Joshua Michtom, a Hartford City Council member and an attorney who has represented children and parents in juvenile court, said although there’s a nearby parking garage, it’s more expensive and it fills up.
“You have to be there, but then you don’t know how long you’re going to have to wait,” Michtom said. “And the courts are not particularly forgiving if you’re not there the moment your case gets called.”
When Franklin’s name was finally called, a judge rejected her plea to stave off eviction. Dejected and stressed about losing her home, she walked out of court only to discover her 2015 Volvo was gone. Franklin had more than a dozen unpaid parking tickets, some of which were nearly 20 years old. She’d forgotten about some, and others were for vehicles she no longer owned. About half of the tickets were for exceeding the meter limit or parking over the line near the courthouse.
“I had paid for the parking meter and everything,” Franklin said. “They drive around, and they look for people’s cars.”

Jill Turlo, CEO of the Hartford Parking Authority, said the agency’s officers use license plate scanners to find people with outstanding tickets. Turlo said “high-traffic metered areas,” like the street the courthouse is on, are “regularly patrolled by parking enforcement.” Turlo said that the parking authority has not received any requests to extend the time for metered parking near the courthouses.
While towing cars for unpaid parking tickets is a common practice for cities, Minnesota passed a law last year barring such tows, seeing them as an unfair burden on low-income families. Several cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, have also stopped such tows after a California appeals court ruled that towing cars for unpaid parking tickets violated people’s rights against warrantless seizures, said Rebecca Miller, an attorney with the Western Center on Law & Poverty.
Hartford has one of the strictest policies in Connecticut. A city ordinance allows tows after two or more unpaid tickets that date back to September 2012. Other cities including Danbury and New Britain don’t tow for unpaid tickets. Norwalk and Waterbury will tow if there are four unpaid tickets; Stamford tows for three unpaid tickets or more than $250 owed, officials in those cities said. The limit in Bridgeport is $100, and New Haven’s is $200.
“We do have an ordinance where we can boot a car for unpaid tickets, but we haven’t used it in years,” said Deborah Pacific, director of the Danbury Parking Authority.
When Franklin went to eviction court, she had been trying to hold onto the place she and her daughter lived while she looked for a new job. Between unpaid fines, late fees, and towing and storage charges, it would have cost almost $3,000 to get her car back, she said.
“I would have chose to pay whatever I owed to my housing. So my car, there was nothing I could do,” Franklin said.
The vehicle was towed by Metro Auto Body & Towing, which did not return calls and emails for comment. It was later sold by the lender.
After losing her car and housing, Franklin moved to Florida to stay with her son.
Parking Sticker in the Wrong Place
Fixed: Apartment residents now have 72 hours if caught without a parking permit or with an expired one.
It’s often little discrepancies that lead to big consequences. When Tishawn Tillman moved into his Hartford apartment in September, he got a parking sticker that allowed him to park in the building’s private lot. He said he wasn’t sure where to put it, so he stuck it on the driver’s side window. 
But less than a month later, his car was towed by Cross Country Automotive in Hartford.
“There is absolutely no legal documentation in my lease that says that this has to be strictly on the windshield,” Tillman said.
Minor rule violations such as parking crooked or not backing into a space have caused people’s cars to be towed and then sold when they couldn’t afford the fees. Stories like Tillman’s drove legislators to act. Under the new law, the towing company would have had to warn Tillman, giving him 72 hours to get a new sticker and place it in the right spot. The law also says towers have to get permission from the apartment complex to tow a vehicle unless it’s blocking traffic or parked in a fire lane.
Tillman said he assumed his car had been stolen. But the police told him it had been towed.
Tillman contacted Cross Country: “I asked them, ‘Did you see my sticker?’ And they said, ‘We didn’t see the sticker.’” He said he called the apartment manager, but he wouldn’t help.
“When I realized that neither of the parties were going to budge on the matter, I told them that I wasn’t going to pay the fine, even if I had the money, which I didn’t at the time,” Tillman said.
Tillman said his bill was “$200 but growing every day.”
He filed a complaint with the attorney general’s office, which said it unsuccessfully tried to resolve the issue through its voluntary mediation program and recommended he complain to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Sal Sena, Cross Country’s owner, submitted a letter to the attorney general saying there are signs all over the parking lot explaining the rules. The apartment manager, Jack Matos, wrote to the attorney general that he talked with Sena about giving TIllman a discount on the towing fees.
“I reiterated Tishawn needs to make sure that it’s placed on the windshield,” Matos wrote.
Frustrated, Tillman eventually gave up trying to get his car back.
“I went from being a self-made young man with his own apartment and car to having to burn a hole in my pocket just to get to and from work on ride-share services like Uber and Lyft,” he said.
Unable to Reclaim Car Despite Having the Title
Fixed: The law allows vehicle owners to reclaim their cars with other documents besides DMV registration.
Shaleah Carr needed two more weeks until her DMV appointment in April to register the Chevrolet Malibu she had just bought from her mom. It was the earliest appointment she could get.
Her boyfriend had taken the car to his brother’s house to work on it when they decided to take it for a test drive. But the car broke down on U.S. Route 5 in South Windsor, and police called for a tow. 
Her boyfriend told the tow truck driver that the car was registered to Carr’s mother and that Carr had the title and proof of insurance. But the towing company, Tolland Automotive, wouldn’t release the vehicle to Carr because she wasn’t the registered owner, said the company’s owner, George Fellows. The vehicle was towed on a Friday afternoon, and by the time Carr was able to get to the lot on Monday morning, she owed more than $300.
“I told them I’m on one income and I can’t afford it,” Carr said. “I just paid my rent for that month, and I even asked, ‘Do you guys do payments?’” 
Since then, her Malibu has been sitting in the company’s lot.

Carr’s dilemma has happened to people whose cars have been towed across Connecticut — they’ve been unable to quickly register their cars and then blocked from reclaiming them because they’re not registered in their names yet. By the time they can register their cars, so much time has passed that the tow bill is too expensive or the company has sold their car.
The new law gives consumers time to register their car before it can be towed and requires towers to release vehicles if presented with the title or a bill of sale as proof of ownership. The law also requires towers to accept other forms of payment besides cash and demands towers have business hours on weekends so fees don’t accrue while they’re closed.
Fellows said police called them to the scene. “Then we found out that this guy didn’t own the car at all,” Fellows said. Without the owner there, “it had to come back to our shop.”
Carr called her mother. “I was like, ‘You’re going to have to come up here,’ but even if she does, she can’t really do much,” Carr said. “She didn’t have the money to get it back either.”
Carr said the last time she called Tolland Automotive, the bill was $800. Given that she paid her mother only $500 for the car, she said, it almost wasn’t worth trying to get it back anymore.
Fellows said Carr’s mother did come into the office earlier this month with proof of registration, and he is willing to release the vehicle if she pays what is owed.
“It’s all on them,” he said. “I mean they knew what the issue was back then. Why haven’t they come back?”

Registry shows only 22% of owners have a primary mailing address in town.

This story by Aaron Calvin and Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 26.
Data from Stowe’s new short-term rental registry, which went live at the beginning of May, shows that most of those properties’ owners don’t live in town full-time.
Of the 891 registrants who provided the town of Stowe with information about their rental properties as of late May, just 196, or 22 percent, listed their “owner mailing address” in Stowe.
Another 86 registrants have mailing addresses listed in Vermont. Nearly as many properties — 260 — are registered to Massachusetts mailing addresses.
According to assistant town manager Will Fricke, about 90 short-term rental owners have failed to respond to mailed requests that they participate in the registry.
The registry requirement was codified last year, after a 3-2 majority of the Stowe Selectboard voted to pass an ordinance that would establish a short-term rental regulation. That ordinance requires property owners to share information about themselves and their property managers with the town and adhere to certain regulations for public safety purposes.
The ordinance was opposed tooth and nail by a class of rental owners and property managers who were able to petition for a public referendum on the law. A town meeting held in May 2024 saw Stowe residents overwhelmingly support — in a 435-240 vote — the establishment of a town registry.
The data collected in the registry reveals what many advocates for the proposal suspected: there are many short-term rentals in Stowe and most of them are owned by non-residents. What implications this has for Stowe’s housing access needs, an ongoing subject of analysis and public discussion from the formation of the new town plan to the town’s nascent housing task force, remains to be determined.
Selectboard reactions
Stowe selectboard members said it’s too early to draw conclusions about the registry, but next month’s highly-anticipated report from the housing task force — after a year-long charge to study housing in Stowe — could spark selectboard discussions about short-term rentals and other housing topics.
According to emails between town manager Charles Safford and Jeff Sauser of CommunityScale, a housing consultant who outlined a timeline for Stowe’s registry and other housing goals, the selectboard wants to wait until next year to discuss the results of the registry, after gathering a year’s worth of data.
Short-term rental property owners in Stowe aren’t required to register with the town until their property becomes active, so a year’s worth of data would give the town a full picture of how many properties there are in Stowe. But with a good chunk of properties already registered, selectboard chair Paco Aumand said the board might want to discuss the registry sooner than a year.
“Creating the registry has accomplished what it was set out to do, and that is provide valuable data around how many short-term rentals we really have in Stowe,” Aumand, who initially voted against the registry, said. “Now it’s time to take a hard look at what that means in terms of action.”
For Aumand, the ultimate goal is to boost Stowe’s full-time population, which aligns with the town plan and stated public opinion. But targeting short-term rentals is just one tool in the toolbox, according to McKee Macdonald, chair of the housing task force. He pointed to other tools like deed restrictions, new housing development, or establishing a housing reserve fund.
Sauser agreed.
“Short-term rentals have been a popular topic in Stowe for years, but there are many more housing ideas that frankly haven’t been baked through,” he said. “We don’t want the conversation to start and end with short-term rentals.”
Rep. Jed Lipsky, I-Stowe, is in favor of short-term rentals for homesteaders, but not for out-of-staters or “private equity types looking to build a portfolio,” and he agreed with Sauser.
Lipsky advised against “scapegoating” short-term rentals for Stowe’s housing crisis. He admits they play a role, but they’re also an important revenue source for some working-class families in Stowe.
“We could take every short-term rental off the market tomorrow, but then who in Vermont could afford to buy those properties?” Lipsky said. “The solution must be multifaceted.”
Next month’s housing task force report will offer a slate of options for the selectboard — including how the board might deal with short-term rentals in Stowe — rather than specific recommendations, McKee said. From there, it’s up to the selectboard to decide on a path.
Selectboard member Ethan Carlson said that while the registry validates some of the assumptions around short-term rentals and their impact on Stowe’s housing market, the board still needs to take its time rolling out potential policy changes.
Carlson, echoing some of Lipsky’s comments, is sensitive to property rights of short-term rental owner and the 196 properties that are registered with Stowe addresses, some of which might be operated by longtime Stowe residents looking to bump up their income.
“I’d like to see the process play out,” Carlson said, referencing the task force’s upcoming report, “I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that short-term rentals would be the first action or the most logical until we kind of look at the situation holistically.”
Few big owners
Of the 891 property owners currently registered as part of the Stowe registry, 64 of them own two or more of those properties, but few own more than five.
Chuck and Jann Perkins — former “ski bums,” original owners of the Alpine Shop in South Burlington and inductees to the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame, to which they made a million-dollar donation in 2023 — are technically Stowe’s largest short-term rental owners by volume.
The Perkinses, whose primary residence is in Burlington, have registered 10 short-term rentals with the town of Stowe. All of them are condominiums located in a single building at The Lodge at Spruce Peak, the mountainside complex that features a mix of seasonal lodging, traditional hospitality and other amenities.
The couple began acquiring condos at Spruce Peak as it was being built at the turn of the century, and each time they sold a property elsewhere in town and didn’t know what to acquire next, they would pick up another and, over time, they have accumulated, Jann Perkins said.

They own 19 different properties in town, according to the Stowe grand list. She said they primarily rent those residences out on a long-term basis, and the tenants have lived in them for years. She added they may be primarily Burlington residents, but they spend most weekends in Stowe, where they are devoted members of the Stowe Community Church.
Sam Gaines, Spruce Peak Realty president, declined to say how many properties are managed as short-term rentals by the company, but a property manager with Stowe Mountain Rentals told Fricke in an email related to the short-term rental registry that the company manages more than 45 properties at The Lodge at Spruce Peak.
Gaines argued that the Spruce Peak condos, like the ones the Perkinses own, shouldn’t be considered housing units in the traditional sense, but are essentially hotel rooms. With hoteliers in Stowe managing rooms or condominiums on sites like Airbnb and VRBO, the line is increasingly a blurred one.
“Practically, we do not believe they are ‘short-term rental’ units. However, the town adopted a very unusual definition of (short-term rentals) to include hotel rooms that are owned through a condominium governance structure,” Gaines said. “We believe this is bad policy and inconsistent with most similar municipal regulations around the country.”
Another one of Stowe’s larger short-term rental owners, Ryan Rabidou, who owns five, also uses them as part of his hospitality business, Om Home Residences.
Colin Moffatt, a Stowe resident and coach at Mt. Mansfield Academy, is also among the town’s largest short-term rental owners, with six residential units in two different buildings in the heart of Stowe village.
Jose Saavedra, one of Stowe’s largest short-term rental owners and who is primarily based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, operates five short-term rentals across three separate properties. Saavedra owns nine properties through his limited-liability company in Stowe, a downsizing from the 17 residential units he owned in 2022.
Saavedra became an illustrative example of the ways in which the short-term rental market could affect housing access in the resort town after a 93-year-old was forced to leave his residence after Saavedra decided to convert the rental from long to short-term.

The degree of administrative burden on primary care is uniquely American.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kenyon Bolton: The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ will make Vermont’s primary care shortage even worse.","This commentary is by Kenyon Bolton. He is an internal medicine physician who lives in East Montpelier.


It is already difficult to find a new primary care clinician in Vermont. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” making its way through the U.S. Congress will likely make it harder thanks to its proposed Medicaid work requirements and more frequent eligibility recertifications. 
I am an internal medicine physician who works in hospital medicine. I love primary care and volunteer in an outpatient clinic, but chose employment in the hospital setting in part due to the administrative burdens increasingly placed on primary care. 
Primary care clinicians already have the unenviable task of gatekeeping many social services. When not in the exam room, they are completing paperwork for their patients’ disability determination for social security, special education services, substance use disorder support, home health services, housing and food assistance and family medical leave, in addition to onerous tasks related to documentation and insurance.
A well-staffed office works hard to help manage this load, but the pile of paperwork ends up on your doctor’s desk next to critical lab results, radiology findings, prior authorizations and medical charting.
The degree of administrative burden on primary care is uniquely American.
Compared to countries with more robust social safety nets and universal healthcare, U.S. physicians spend more time on administrative tasks, including screening for and managing social issues. Based on a recent survey compiled by the Vermont Medical Society, we know that Vermont clinicians report burnout just from prior authorizations alone. Vermont physician leaders have recently sounded the alarm regarding these cumulative pressures on primary care. 
With its enactment of Medicaid work requirements, the bill will double down on bureaucratic burdens for primary care, not to mention the Americans who depend on Medicaid. As written, the House bill would exempt “medically frail” people from work requirements, which will likely require clinician approval.
Additionally, the bill requires more frequent Medicaid eligibility recertifications, up from annually to every six months. This is a known contributor to “enrollment churn,” where enrollees lose and regain coverage. Churn increases administrative costs to states, ups the number of ED visits and hospitalizations, and swells burdens on both practices and patients.
Not only will the One Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts likely lead to increased mortality, put rural hospitals at risk of closing, and cause confusion for patients, it will probably increase the administrative burden on your primary care office. I’m not the only doctor who has steered away from primary care because of its unwieldy administrative demands as things stand, and we should all expect Vermont’s primary care shortage to worsen with this bill. 
In recent VTDigger commentaries, Alex Messinger urged Vermonters to connect with their family and friends in red states to oppose the bill’s cuts to clean energy incentives, and Dr. Julie Ehrlich at UVM has highlighted the bill’s impact on pediatric care.Additionally, we can urge Gov. Phil Scott to join our federal delegation in vocally opposing the One Big Beautiful Bill for the sake of our state’s primary care practices. I was glad to see that he did not join his Republican colleagues in supporting the bill. Let’s take the next step and call on him to join the bipartisan opposition to Medicaid cuts.

On Tuesday, the gasoline tax will rise by six cents a gallon, the first increase in nine years for the primary revenue source sustaining Washington’s transportation system.
The hike is the most prominent piece of a six-year, $3.2 billion package passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this year. 
Lawmakers turned to the tax to contend with a projected $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year transportation budget. Officials said this was caused by an inflation-fueled surge in construction costs and flattening gas tax receipts as more drivers opt for electric vehicles and as cars have become more fuel efficient.
“This will keep projects on track and ensure the promises we’ve made can be kept,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “As you drive around and see those orange cones, that’s where your money is at work.”
Tuesday’s increase will push the state’s per-gallon tax rate on gas and other vehicle fuels from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. Starting July 1, 2026, it will rise each year by 2% — about a penny annually — to account for inflation.
Also Tuesday, the state tax on diesel will climb an additional three cents, so 9 cents total, to 58.4 cents, then go up another three cents two years later. That additional six cents applied to diesel will be subject to a 2% boost each year starting July 1, 2028.
Washington will have the nation’s third highest state gas tax behind California and Pennsylvania. Connecticut is currently at 52.4 cents, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.
Washington’s state tax is on top of federal fuel taxes, which are 18.4 cents for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel.
Hiking the gas tax is expected to raise $1.4 billion over the next six years. The diesel tax is counted on to bring in $166 million over that time.
These increases are two of the larger entrees in the transportation package’s smorgasbord of new taxes and higher fees.
Under the legislation, passenger vehicle weight fees are going up a few dollars. The added sales tax for vehicles will climb from 0.3% to 0.5%. 
There’s also a new 8% tax on the portion of the selling price of vehicles above $100,000 and a 10% tax on non-commercial aircraft sales above $500,000. 
There’s a temporary increase in the rental car tax as well, from 5.9% to 11.9%, before moving down to 9.9% in 2027.
And there’s more.
The tire disposal fee will go from $1 apiece to $5 apiece. Washington State Ferries will boost its vessel replacement surcharge by 50 cents in October and start imposing a 3% fee for those who pay with credit cards next year. 
This week’s increase in gas and diesel taxes may not be immediately noticeable.
The state collects those taxes before fuel gets pumped. They are paid by the distributor — the business that buys or imports gasoline and transports it to the neighborhood gas station. Distributors will decide how they pass their costs onto the station owner, who must decide if they will pass on any added costs to customers. 
Washington created a motor vehicle fuel tax in 1921. It applied to special fuels, too, according to the state Department of Licensing.
The last gas tax boost totalled 11.9 cents and anchored the Connecting Washington transportation package passed by the Legislature in 2015. It led to increases of 7 cents per gallon in July 2015 and 4.9 cents a year later. 
Washington gas prices are higher now than a year ago. The average price of a gallon of regular gas was $4.45 on Friday compared to $4.33 in 2024, according to AAA. Nationally, the average price was $3.20 on Friday.
Critics of the state’s Climate Commitment Act, which requires refineries and other businesses to pay for their air pollution, say that law has pushed up gas prices in recent years.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gas-prices-at-pump-washington-state--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

(Getty Images)A decade after Indiana overhauled its criminal code to reduce incarceration, lawmakers approved more than a dozen new crimes and sentencing enhancements. 
The new laws, set to take effect July 1, were passed in this year’s long legislative session. Among the changes are stricter sentences for fentanyl-related offenses, harsher penalties for resisting law enforcement and criminalizing swatting – or falsely reporting an emergency.   
The Indiana Department of Correction is nearing full capacity according to a recent prison population report. As of June, state prison facilities were operating at 94.38% capacity – with one prison over 100% full. The system currently houses 25,305 inmates, with a total of 26,812 beds. 
“This is a policy decision you have to make,” Democratic Rep. Matt Pierce said. “Do you spend your resources incarcerating people for decades in a state prison, or do you spend your resources on treating the underlying causes of the crime.”
  Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington. (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The DOC is spending billions on a new prison and also has struggled to keep up with costs it owes to local county jails.
In 2014, Gov. Mike Pence signed a major criminal code reform bill to reduce prison populations and save millions in correctional costs. The bill also prioritized mental health and rehabilitation programs for lower-level offenders. Prior to the bill, a comprehensive review of the criminal code had not been done in almost 40 years. 
The bill requires the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute to annually gather data and analyze the impact of Indiana criminal code reform on local units of government, the DOC and the judicial system.
Lawmakers haven’t been shy about adding new crimes and sentences to the criminal justice landscape in Indiana. 
Pierce, who co-authored the reform bill, said newer members of the General Assembly have reverted into the old way of thinking – the idea that every year an additional sentence is added on to a crime, the crime will go down. 
“If you want to reduce crime, you can’t simply do the easy thing,” he said. “Which is to increase the penalty and then walk away and say ‘you solve the problem.’”
  Chris Naylor, executive director of the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council.
Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council Executive Director Chris Naylor said it’s not new laws that are creating issues for the DOC but the amount of violent offenders and attorney shortages. 
“Over the last 10 years, there’s been over a 40% increase in murders,” Naylor said. “And so it’s not much any new laws that are having this impact, it is the level of violent crimes that increasing in our state.” 
Naylor said caseloads show the state needs 384 more attorneys to cover cases. He said the salaries of deputy prosecutors are lagging way behind any other public service attorney or private sector attorney. 
Indiana has a growing statewide lawyer shortage especially in rural counties. Over half of the state’s counties are considered “legal deserts,” and have fewer than one attorney per 1,000 Hoosiers. In 2024, the Commission on Indiana’s Legal Future was created to address attorney shortages. They have until July 1 to submit a final report.
 Fentanyl penalty increased

A key factor in this year’s legislation was fentanyl. Indiana’s drug overdose crisis has worsened since the 2014 reforms and fentanyl came after code reform, Pierce said. In 2022, there were a total of 2,682 overdose deaths with 72% involving fentanyl or other synthetic opioids in Indiana, according to USAFacts. 
In response, Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, authored a public safety bill that increases penalties for fentanyl-related crimes. It passed with bipartisan support. 
“Public safety has always been one of my top priorities as a Senator,” Freeman said in a press release. “This bill was not created to put additional burdens on government agencies, but to keep violent criminals off the streets of our Hoosier communities. Soft-on-crime prosecuting and bail policies are hurting innocent people in many cities, including Indianapolis.”
Pierce disagrees with the bill. He also said he does not see a major criminal code reform happening anytime soon but one might be necessary if the legislature continue on the path of adding new penalties and enhancements.
“I think it was a mistake to do the new enhancements on fentanyl,” Pierce said. 
 Naylor called the fentanyl provision an appropriate response. He said our drug statutes work based on the different weights of the drug. 
“The old weights just were antiquated when you’re dealing with a substance as potent and as deadly as fentanyl, so that made total sense,” Naylor said. 
 Other crimes

Zach Stock, legislative counsel for the Indiana Public Defender Council, said his group generally opposes new crimes or enhancements. 
House Enrolled Act 1014 increases the penalty for resisting law enforcement, a charge Stock says appears in thousands of cases each year. The same law also restricts government entities from hosting or organizing obscene performances. 
“Every time we tinker with the code in one isolated area, we lose sight of the whole code,” Stock said. “But we still can’t blame the crisis on new crimes or enhancements.”
Swatting will now be a Level 6 felony in Indiana. This change comes from Senate Enrolled Act 198 authored by Freeman and Sen. Eric Koch. 
“The bill was necessary because existing law didn’t define the conduct to allow for effective prosecution. Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing amount of swatting around the country, and this was necessary to protect the safety of our citizens,” Koch said. 
Previously the punishment was a class A misdemeanor, a max of one year in prison. A person facing a Level 6 felony could spend up to two and a half years in prison. 
A new crime was introduced this year that lawmakers would have never envisioned ten years ago – signal jamming, a device that disrupts communications. SEA 26 makes it a Level 5 felony if someone uses a signal jammer to disrupt a critical infrastructure facility or the communications of a public safety agency. 
Another law makes it a Level 6 felony for a passenger of a vehicle to point a firearm during the commission of the driver’s criminal recklessness.

Editor’s Note: In May, Gov. Joe Lombardo signed Senate Bill 169, which prohibits third-party reservation websites from listing restaurants without their permission. The bill, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate, passed the Legislature unanimously and goes into effect later this year, on Oct. 1.
The following story, originally published by Stateline, provides insight into the issue, which is affecting restaurants in popular dining destinations across the country. 			


NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.
So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.
Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.

(Via @DHS.gov)Younger readers may be unaware there was a time when politicians followed the rules, almost as if they cared about good government.
Certainly there were liars, fraudsters, and zealots, your Sen. Joe McCarthys, your Sen. Styles Bridges, and, of course, the great-granddaddy of corruption and sleaze, Richard Nixon, but most lawmakers actually seemed to believe in, you know, the law.
Seems almost quaint.
Take a look, if you can stomach it, at Florida’s sitting attorney general, one James Uthmeier Esq.
A federal judge has held him in contempt for violating a court order halting SB 4C — last session’s bill allowing the state to arrest anyone who might kinda sorta look “illegal.”
Brown folks rounded up by handcuff-happy cops included at least one American citizen.
Uthmeier took to X, proclaiming, “If being held in contempt is what it costs to defend the rule of law and stand firmly behind President Trump’s agenda on illegal immigration, so be it.”
Older readers will detect an echo of former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who did her damnedest to stall ballot recounts in the great Gore-Bush imbroglio of 2000, and who would grandly quote the Biblical Queen Esther, “If I perish, I perish.”
The AG appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, half of whom were appointed by Trump. They told him (in judicial language) to get lost.
 Scofflaw history
Uthmeier’s lucky U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams didn’t fine him or throw his arrogant backside in jail.
Still, it’s early days: Hope Florida, the nonprofit founded by the state’s ambitious First Lady, is under investigation by North Florida State’s Attorney Jack Campbell. Uthmeier is up to his eyeballs in this one.
State Rep. Alex Andrade (R-Pensacola) has accused Uthmeier of criminal fraud and money laundering.
Seems Hope Florida got a $10 million “donation” of taxpayer money, of which a good chunk went to a PAC controlled by Uthmeier.
You can’t use that money for political purposes; nevertheless, that’s just what Uthmeier’s PAC did, spending it on ads to defeat last year’s recreational marijuana amendment.
DeSantis hadn’t yet elevated Uthmeier, then his chief of staff, to the AG job, but still: The guy was an officer of the court, a member of the Florida Bar.
You’d think he’d get it.
Then again, Florida under DeSantis is not known for adherence to the rule of law.
Remember in 2022 when the governor tricked a bunch of Venezuelan asylum seekers onto a plane and flew them to Martha’s Vineyard? Legally dubious? Ethically ugly? Yes and yes.
De Santis is also the guy who suspended one state attorney for saying he wouldn’t pursue abortion cases and another because, he claimed, she wouldn’t enforce state law.
“State attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law,” he said. “Not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda,” adding that those outlaw prosecutors were “basically saying that they didn’t want to enforce statutes that the Legislature had done.”
Yet when James Uthmeier said he wouldn’t enforce a statute passed by the Legislature, namely, Florida’s 2018 law forbidding anyone under 21 to buy a long gun, the governor shrugged.
He said that law is unconstitutional anyway and that Uthmeier’s stance was a “good-faith position.”
What’s the difference? The two state attorneys he suspended are Democrats.
Besides, as Floridians all know, the sacred right to pack heat matters more than actual human beings like the two people killed by a white supremacist Trumper on the FSU campus in April.
Unfortunately for us, DeSantis and his enablers aren’t particularly troubled by a bit of violence, as long as it’s perpetrated by the right people.
While he initially criticized the Jan. 6 riot, calling it “unacceptable,” he soon fell in line with MAGA-speak, denying there was an “insurrection” of any kind and defending Trump’s role in what was clearly an attempted coup.
So what if a few Capitol police got roughed up? They were on the wrong side.
In Florida, we like cops to be on the right side, making sure Marxists, environmentalists, feminists, BLM radicals, LGBTQ-types, and other outside agitators get what’s coming to them.
And, according to the governor, citizens can play cop, too.
In advance of the No Kings protests on June 14, DeSantis decreed that any patriotic, God-fearing, Trump-voting motorist who felt threatened or even just mildly inconvenienced by those freaks marching in one of the 70-odd demonstrations across Florida had his permission to give ’em a little automotive nudge.
“If you drive off and you hit one of these people, that’s their fault for impinging on you,” he said. “You don’t have to sit there and just be a sitting duck and let the mob grab you out of your car and drag you through the streets.”
DeSantis clearly cut con law class the day they discussed freedom of assembly.
 Something in the water?
You begin to wonder if there’s something about Florida that encourages a complete disregard not just of decent behavior but of the rule of law.
Maybe it’s some kind of mosquito-borne illness? Maybe the toxic algae choking our waters emits a foul miasma that clouds the brain’s moral center?
Maybe it’s a fish problem, you know, rotting from the head down?
In any case, scofflaws flock to Florida like rats to a burger joint dumpster.
We’ve a long history of criminality: Al Capone hung out in Miami Beach, and Charles Ponzi sold worthless swampland to rubes dreaming of a life in “paradise.”
It’s no surprise the current occupant of the White House, a casino-bankrupting grifter with 34 felony convictions, chose Palm Beach County as his home.
For a brief period in history — way back there, from the 1960s to the 1990s — Florida was known as a good-government state, with leaders such as Reuben Askew, Bob Graham, and Lawton Chiles, who promoted education, conservation, and transparency.
Again, quaint.
In the past couple of decades, however, we’ve elected such prize porkers as a governor whose company perpetrated a huge Medicare and Medicaid fraud and an attorney general who saw nothing untoward in taking a $25,000 campaign contribution from Donald Trump then dropping an investigation into his shady “university.”
Rick Scott is now a U.S. senator; Pam Bondi is now the attorney general of the United States.
Bondi’s busy demonstrating how much she learned in Florida, doing her damnedest to destroy the separation of powers enumerated in the Constitution.
She’s suing every single federal judge in the state of Maryland for having the brass-faced gall to issue orders insisting on due process for people the Trump regime wants to deport.
Doing their job, in other words.
 Lawyers or lawless?
Meanwhile, back down here in the sunniest state with the shadiest government, DeSantis and Uthmeier are back with a brand new bad idea: “Alligator Alcatraz,” a huge ICE detention camp in the Everglades.
The state seized the land from Miami-Dade County to park a 5,000-bed facility bang in the middle of the state’s greatest environmental treasure.
Who cares if it’s legal? It sure ain’t moral.
Despite the state’s claims that the place won’t hurt the surrounding wetland ecosystem (apparently 5,000 people in housing pods won’t create any run-off and all the trucks and buses transporting people and supplies will not make a mark upon the land), it’s an assault on a vulnerable and irreplaceable place.
Remember that the next time you hear DeSantis’ bleating how he wants to “save” the Everglades.
DeSantis, Bondi, and Uthmeier may call themselves lawyers, but they are lawless.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaiceGujVUrVW4AA9pXF.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor.More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.



“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

The challenges facing our communities are daunting. The pace of technological, economic and social change is relentless. The pursuit of the resources needed to fuel progress and improve the quality of life is all-consuming.
As Indiana-based Sagamore Institute documented last year in its “Workforce 2040: Pathways to Prosperity” report, our state and our communities have arrived at a pivotal moment in history as powerful economic, demographic and technological trends converge.
Great opportunities lie ahead but also great challenges. How we tackle both at the local and state levels will largely shape the quality of life in cities and towns throughout Indiana in the years ahead.
The good news is that our mayors and other community leaders don’t have to face these challenges alone. We want to offer a way to help.
Goldsmith program
In April, Sagamore Institute announced the inaugural Goldsmith Prize for Innovation in Local Government, an initiative that will recognize and support an Indiana community that is responding to today’s challenges with fresh thinking and forward-looking solutions
The award is named after former Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, long recognized as a national leader in delivering innovative solutions to local governments in our state and beyond.
The Goldsmith Prize is about innovation in the broadest sense: rethinking outdated processes, forging creative partnerships, designing smarter policies and improving service delivery in ways that make life better for residents.
It’s about celebrating what’s working – and sharing it so others can benefit. What succeeds in Vincennes may also help Richmond, Bluffton or Brazil.
The winning community will receive not only recognition but also practical support: a graduate student with expertise in the project’s focus area will be assigned to help lead implementation in 2026. The position will be funded through the prize via a one-year stipend.
Additional technical advice and information resources will be provided, along with a platform to share success stories, foster partnerships, and encourage replication and innovation across the state.
Applications for the Goldsmith Prize are now being accepted. The deadline to apply is July 31.
In August, a panel of leaders in the business sector, nonprofit organizations and government will review applications to determine three finalists. Leaders from those communities will be invited to give a presentation on Aug. 22. From those presentations, the inaugural winning community will be selected and announced at the Aim Ideas Summit in October in French Lick.
Sparking innovation
So, what does innovation look like?
As mayor of La Porte, one of us (Blair) approved a recommendation from the city engineer to use a comprehensive asset management system that evaluated the condition of every street in the city’s 113-mile network. Each road received a PASER score (1 to 10), enabling the city to rank streets from best to worst and develop a long-term plan that prioritized critical repairs while preserving roads in good shape.
It wasn’t flashy, but it was smart. This data-driven, proactive approach helped La Porte stretch limited resources further— and it later became the model for a now-required process in the state’s Community Crossings Matching Grant program.
That’s the kind of innovation we’re talking about — not just new gadgets or apps, but better ways of doing the work that matters most – whether that’s managing infrastructure, tackling housing or workforce challenges, improving customer service or strengthening civic trust.
How is your community rethinking how it serves residents? What partnerships, tools, policies or practices are helping you do more with less – and do it better?
We want to know, not only to recognize and reward your success but also to inform and inspire leaders in other communities.
Because we know how hard it can be to lead well when the pace of change is so intense. Because we know resources are perpetually tight.
And because we know that by working together in our communities and across our state, we can find the solutions to meet the enormous challenges that lie ahead.

Without those guardrails, expansion remains a policy in name, not in practice (Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)In Missouri, we don’t just live with fewer healthcare options. We live with the knowledge that when help doesn’t come, it’s not an accident. It’s policy.
I’m a nurse. I’ve worked in rural hospitals, in short-staffed ICUs, in systems that have learned how to survive without actually protecting anyone. And what I see now is worse than neglect. It reflects a pattern of disinvestment that disproportionately harms the communities least able to withstand it.
When Missouri expanded Medicaid, it should have brought relief to communities long denied basic care. But expansion on paper doesn’t mean access in practice. Administrative backlogs, endless documentation hurdles, and network gaps continue to leave people stranded. In rural Missouri, I’ve seen patients with Medicaid cards still turned away. Expansion without infrastructure does not create equity, it creates the appearance of reform without its substance.
In 2020, Missouri voters passed Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative. Lawmakers delayed implementation for nearly a year. That delay wasn’t just bureaucratic. It was ideological. The same political opposition continues to influence how care is distributed or withheld across the state.
To be clear, challenges in administering Medicaid are real. Eligibility redeterminations involve complex systems. Rural provider recruitment is difficult. Coordination between state agencies and federal requirements often creates delays that are frustrating for both patients and administrators.
But acknowledging these logistical hurdles does not excuse their persistence. Missouri’s failure is not in encountering difficulty. It is in choosing not to fix what has been broken for years. When barriers are allowed to persist despite known solutions, the outcome is not accidental.
Meanwhile, Missouri continues to use a provider tax shell game to draw down billions in federal Medicaid dollars. Hospitals get the financial boost. But there is no requirement that those dollars improve care, staff safety, or patient outcomes. The state collects its match. The money circulates. And the hospitals that serve the poorest communities still close.
According to the Leapfrog Group and the U.S. Office of Inspector General, preventable harm events including falls, infections, and medication errors are significantly more common in hospitals with chronic staffing shortages. While safety grades vary across Missouri, the pattern is clear: when staffing ratios fall, risks to patients rise.
When Noble Health shut down the hospital in Mexico, Missouri, in 2022, patients were given no notice. Staff were told by text message. The facility that once served 11,000 ER visits a year went dark overnight. The company had collected CARES Act funds and Medicaid reimbursements before walking away, leaving behind debt, missing records, and no services.
According to state officials, 12 rural hospitals have closed in Missouri since 2014, with a total of 21 hospital closures statewide during that period. More than a dozen others are at risk. OB units are disappearing. Behavioral health beds are gone. And the people left behind are expected to accept this as a funding issue, not a policy choice.
Between June 2023 and May 2024, 400,000 Missourians, including nearly 200,000 children, lost Medicaid coverage. The majority were still eligible but were removed due to procedural errors, incomplete paperwork, or system backlogs. This phenomenon, known as ‘churn,’ is well documented and largely preventable.
Missouri’s procedural termination rate has been among the highest in the country. During several months in 2023, more than 70% of terminations occurred for paperwork reasons rather than actual ineligibility, significantly above the national average.
These administrative failures have financial consequences. When coverage is lost due to technicalities, the state avoids paying for services and saves money. In rural Missouri, where local caseworkers are often nonexistent and providers are scarce, losing Medicaid means losing access altogether.
The Missouri Department of Social Services has long struggled with timely renewals and enrollment processing. But instead of investing in systems that protect continuity of care, the state has maintained systems that obscure accountability and allow breakdowns to persist without correction.
Clinics lose reimbursements. Hospitals reduce services. Patients disengage. Not from care, but from a system that seems designed to shed them.
This is often framed as fiscal responsibility, but in effect, it is policy negligence with life-altering consequences.
In towns like Mexico, Moberly and Kennett, residents already live hours from specialty care.
When the local ER shuts down, it is not just an inconvenience. It is a death sentence that arrives slowly through missed diagnoses, delayed stroke care, untreated infections and silent mental health crises.
Stroke centers disappear when hospitals downgrade. Cardiac care vanishes when chest pain is rerouted to the next county. For rural Missourians, the question is not just when care will arrive, but whether it will arrive in time to matter. This is not a new phenomenon.
A similar wave of closures followed Medicare payment reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. What is different now is how much more consolidated and extractive the system has become. What we are seeing in 2025 is not merely underinvestment, it is a systematic withdrawal of support, often driven by financial incentives misaligned with patient care.
I have watched patients wait twelve hours in ER hallways for a bed. I know of times where the early warning signs were missed because the nurse was covering too many patients. These are not rare exceptions. They are the predictable outcomes of chronic understaffing and systems that treat care as a cost center.
Missouri hospitals are facing a sustained staffing crisis.
In 2023, about 16% of registered nurse positions were vacant across the state. Rural hospitals have been hit especially hard, with turnover and burnout worsening year after year. In some Missouri facilities, nurses have reported caring for five or more patients in units designed for closer supervision, exceeding commonly accepted ratios for step-down care.
This is not a temporary problem. It reflects a chronic shortage that puts both patients and staff at risk. Unsafe staffing has become the norm, and no award or marketing campaign can disguise the consequences of underinvestment in the workforce.
We know what stabilizes care. Local hospitals. Fair reimbursement. Staff-to-patient ratios that protect workers and outcomes. Behavioral health beds. Transportation. Language access. These are not mysteries. They are choices.
Missouri must tie Medicaid dollars to measurable outcomes such as access, staffing and infrastructure. Without those guardrails, expansion remains a policy in name, not in practice.

It’s a mindset that has helped her navigate extreme weather, market shocks and trade disputes.
But this year, Hemmes said, feels different: President Trump’s recent tariff hikes on nearly all major U.S. trading partners have escalated a trade war, fueling uncertainty that is hard to prepare for.
“If there’s all this uncertainty out there, how can we plan? We need a path forward,” Hemmes said. “It’s like changing a tire while we’re still driving down the road.”
U.S. farmers had to navigate a trade war during Trump’s first term, but did so after years of rising commodity prices and government aid.
During the first trade war, Hemmes, a soybean and corn farmer, was able to reduce her debt and invest in new equipment, giving her a cushion and leaving her in “pretty good shape.”
However, this second Trump trade war comes at a time when farmers are in a more vulnerable financial position.
Over the last four years, grain prices have been on a downward trend. Soybeans — a major U.S. export and a pillar of the Midwest economy — have lost 34% of their value on the international market. Net farm income, while still above pre-pandemic levels, has declined for three consecutive years.
At the same time, input prices for fertilizer, fuel and other essential supplies have surged over the past five years, squeezing farmer profit margins and putting added strain on operations.
“The big difference between the first trade war and now is our input prices. They’re a lot higher than they were,” Hemmes said.
Borrowing has also become significantly more expensive for farmers, as the average interest rates charged on loans for land purchases and farm operations have increased by over 40% since 2020.
“I’ve never seen a time where the level of policy uncertainty is as high as it is right now,” said Patrick Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri.
“You have all the normal uncertainties that farmers face just because of weather and so on. Now you’ve got this huge policy uncertainty as well. It may turn out well, or it may turn out very badly, and we just don’t know right now.”
Westhoff said the financial health of farmers facing this second trade war varies by sector, with crop producers in a challenging position, while the cattle sector is faring better thanks to higher prices.
“We’ve seen net returns to crop producers fall back to levels we hadn’t seen since before COVID,” Westhoff said. At the same time, he said, fixed costs are much higher, and land and machinery prices are up.
“At some point, something has to change. Either they have to get more income or they have to reduce some expenses.”
Fertilizer is one of a farmer’s most significant expenses and has sharply increased.
Ammonium fertilizer, used heavily for corn, increased by more than 15% over the past five years. Phosphorus and potassium, essential for soybeans, rose by over 10%, according to Farmdoc, a research initiative from the University of Illinois’ Department of Agriculture and Consumer Economics.
Diesel, vital for equipment and transport, has seen the second-largest price hike.
“Farmers spend a lot of money before we even put a seed in the ground. We have to borrow a lot of money before we even plant,” Hemmes said.
Farmers have made it through the year relatively well, Hemmes added, mainly because most purchases for the harvest were made the previous year, before the trade tensions arose.
“We’re kind of holding our breath for this fall… that’s when it will hurt the most farmers,” Hemmes said.
 Bigger bills, tighter margins and loans farmers can’t repay

By late 2024, farmers were finding it much harder to borrow money. Bankers reported farms had less cash on hand and weren’t expecting enough income in 2025.
Chad Hart, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, said farmers are in a tough spot: high costs and low crop prices force them to take on more loans, but it’s getting harder to pay them back.
Farmers are applying for more loans than they did a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which tracks agricultural lending in Iowa, Michigan and most of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.
At the same time, the index of repayment rates for non-real-estate farm loans has declined year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, suggesting that many farmers are struggling to catch up, even as they take on more debt to stay afloat.
“Loan repayment has dropped,” Hart said. “A lot of this action is due to just the general decline in crop income over the past couple of years, which started before the trade fight.”
Meanwhile, agricultural loan interest rates have soared to historic highs, well above the levels farmers faced during Trump’s first trade war, making credit more expensive just when many need it most.
Part of the pressure stems from a political clash in Washington. Trump has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, arguing that Americans need cheaper credit. He has even threatened to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
However, the central bank, designed to operate independently, has resisted political pressure.
Federal Reserve officials say they are weighing the inflationary risks of the tariffs and prefer to wait for more economic data before adjusting rates. They also worry that yielding to White House demands could damage the institution’s credibility.
Hart said the current downturn isn’t solely the result of tariffs, but rather the outcome of several compounding pressures. As the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to curb inflation, borrowing costs for farmers also rose. Combine those higher financing costs with falling commodity prices from oversupply, and now renewed tariff concerns, and “you get a recipe for a depressed market,” he said.
 A fragile truce on tariffs is likely temporary

After months of economic fallout, the U.S. and China reached a temporary truce that took effect June 11, cutting tariffs from record highs of 145% to 55% on Chinese goods and 10% on U.S. exports.
Although tensions with China have eased, tariffs on other major trading partners, announced in April, have only been paused until July 9. The truce is widely seen as fragile and temporary.
Hemmes said one of the consequences of the first trade war was that it opened the door for South American countries to enter the Chinese market, especially Brazil, which has become its leading soybean supplier.
Although the U.S. no longer sells the same volume of soybeans as before, “you cannot discard how much China buys,” even as the industry works to diversify its markets in other Asian countries, Hemmes said.
“We need trade with Mexico and Canada, too,” Hemmes added. “That’s why I think the reciprocal tariffs are going to hurt us more. We get fertilizer from Canada, ag chemicals from China, at least some of them. We get parts and products made in Mexico.”
As planting season got underway in April, many farmers were on edge about the ripple effects of U.S. trade policy. A majority of farmers said they expected current tariffs to hurt their bottom line this year, according to the Ag Economy Barometer from Purdue University and the CME Group, which surveyed 400 producers from April 14 to 21.
Farmers expressed particular concern about rising costs and limited availability of key supplies, especially fertilizer, crop chemicals and machinery parts.
However, while 44% said they anticipated a negative impact on farm income in 2025, and 53% feared continuing supply disruptions, 70% said they still believed that higher tariffs could ultimately strengthen the U.S. agricultural economy.
The same study, conducted a month later, also found that producers were more optimistic about both current conditions and future expectations.
“One of the drivers behind this month’s shift in farmer sentiment appeared to be a much more positive view of the U.S.’s long-run agricultural trade prospects,” the report said.
This shift in tone may reflect what Financial Times commentator Robert Armstrong calls TACO, short for Trump Always Chickens Out. The term describes a pattern in Trump’s trade policy: announcing sweeping tariffs that trigger economic shock, panic and stock market drops, only to reverse course later with pauses or reductions that help markets rebound.
“I think markets have become a bit skeptical about what’s actually going to happen,” Westhoff said. “So we saw in the case of the USMCA countries, Mexico and Canada, that, at least right now, tariffs don’t apply to them when it comes to agricultural products.”
He added that with those countries and the European Union — three of the most important trading partners for the U.S. farm sector — trade remains unchanged on the agricultural front.
However, Westhoff warned that the market reaction could be severe if the high tariffs move forward.
“If we get to July 9, or whatever the magic date ends up being, and we do indeed impose those very high tariffs and countries respond,” he said, “then we’re going to see a big market disruption.”

Activists say it proves the project is occurring too close to the groundwater while the DNR and company say it's just rain water. (Photo obtained by the Wisconsin Examiner)A Canadian mining company began work on an exploratory drilling project in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Taylor County earlier this month, triggering local concerns that the project could harm groundwater and the nearby north fork of the Yellow River as the company and state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) insist the permitting and regulatory processes are enough to keep the environment safe. 
Green Light Metals, which runs its U.S. operations out of Medford, owns the mineral rights to the Bend deposit in Taylor County, about 19 miles north of Medford, and the Reef deposit near Wausau. The Bend deposit, which has been explored before, contains copper, gold, silver and zinc. The deposit is estimated to contain more than 4 million tons of ore. If the drilling exploration is successful, it could lead to a larger underground mine. 
The start of work on the project is the beginning of the company’s efforts to expand its operations in the U.S. after it went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange earlier this year. 
“Wisconsin is open for business,” the company’s CEO Matt Filgate said on an investing focused podcast earlier this month. 
Company officials say their aim is to protect the environment while nodding to the possibility that a mine in the region could produce materials necessary for green infrastructure — mostly tellurium, a metal necessary in the construction of solar panels. 
“There are very detailed environmental review and environmental studies that are done on virtually every aspect of the surrounding environment,” Steven Donahue, a Green Light Metals board member, told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in April. “An important component of that is the water resources, but it’s also all the ecosystems. It’s the engineering of the project, it’s how the project is going to be closed and reclaimed, and how it’s going to be able to protect the environment, not only during construction and operations, but also after it’s closed. All those facets of a project would be evaluated by the state.”
Views of the project within the rural, largely conservative county — President Donald Trump won Taylor County with 73.5% of the vote last year — vary widely. Much of the county is covered by the national forest, which Juliana Reimann, a Madison resident who grew up in the county and remains a regular visitor, says is a “magnificent, breathtaking natural environment.” 
Conservative hunters and fishers in the area are concerned about the drilling project’s potential effect on those activities in the forest or on the Yellow River. Still, some community members are hopeful the mine can bring some economic benefits to the community and others are keeping a watchful eye on the project without making a conclusion. 
“Some of the people who are in our group are adamantly opposed to any mine, period,” Cathy Mauer, a member of the Friends of the Yellow River, says. “Some of us think that so far they’re trying to be careful without being naive about it because the goal is to make money for their investors.” 
“I’ve found sometimes the people from Green Light are being, I don’t think they’re lying, I think they believe it, but I don’t think they’re being realistic about the potential problems,” she adds. “I think they’re being straightforward, they’re either optimistic or aren’t being completely realistic about the potential problems. And maybe we’re imagining the worst case scenario, which we need to. It’s the worst case scenarios that cause the problems. That’s what we have to plan for.”
Some environmental activists remain much more concerned about the possible effect of the drilling operation on the local water. 
“I really have such a love for that forest, and that drilling site is right smack dab in the middle of it,” Reimann says. “The project will impact groundwater, as I see it, heavily. And of course, groundwater is critical as drinking water.”
She adds that the health of the forest is important for the community’s ability to “thrive.” 
Wisconsin was under a mining moratorium from 1997 until 2017, which required companies that wanted to mine sulfide ores such as copper and gold to prove that other mines operated and were closed for 10 years without causing pollution. While business groups lauded the law’s repeal as opening up the state to billions of dollars in investment, drilling operations in the state have yet to result in a full mine being opened. 
With the repeal gone, the DNR’s permitting process for drilling operations requires companies to obtain a license and file a notice of intent to drill, which the state can deny, approve or approve with conditions. The company must then obtain a number of permits relating to stormwater discharge, dewatering operations, endangered species and wetland preservation. Because the site is within the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service also has its own permitting process. 
The DNR’s approval of Green Light Metals’ notice of intent included nearly two dozen conditions but despite that, environmental activists remain concerned about a number of aspects of the project. 
When the company drills into the bedrock where the minerals are, the drill must go through the layers, known as the glacial overburden, above it, which requires a steel casing to keep chemicals out of the groundwater. The company obtains cuttings from the bedrock that can be tested for the metals it is looking for. After drilling is complete, the hole is filled from the bottom up with cement, which pushes up the lubricants and water used in the drilling process and flushes out the hole. 
State regulations require that the pipe used to pump in that cement be submerged the entire time so as to prevent air pockets forming. This is often done using what’s known as a tremie pipe, but Green Light Metals is instead pouring cement through the drill rods themselves, which come in 10 foot sections and therefore require that crews stop as each piece is removed — a method that activists are concerned makes the process more likely to cause pollution but DNR metallic mining coordinator Molly Gardner says is common practice. 
The materials flushed out of the drill hole as the cement rises are then put into a lined waste pit dug by the company, encased with more cement and finally covered with the topsoil. 
Activists are concerned the company will not be thorough enough to protect the environment throughout this process.
“It’s like any industrial activity, there is room for error, and if not fixed, you could have a problem,” Dave Blouin, the political chair for the Wisconsin Sierra Club, says. 
Additionally, there has been a dispute about the type of land the company is operating on. Green Light Metals says there is some wetland in the area, but not where it is drilling, while activists say much of the area is wetland, directly connecting the groundwater with the Yellow River. A recent study by the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey found that “the North Fork Yellow River and surrounding surface waters are connected to the shallow glacial aquifer.”
“The North Fork Yellow River is a river within the Chippewa Basin. Over 3,000 stream and river miles flow within the Chippewa River basin and with 156,200 acres of freshwater lakes, 22,711 acres of flowages and more than 150 acres of freshwater springs. The river basin watershed provides significant habitat, recreation, navigation and is a significant drinking water resource for northwest Wisconsin people,” Wisconsin Trout Unlimited said in a resolution opposing the Bend project. “Mining of metallic sulfide ores and minerals has a consistent proven record of surface and ground water contamination and pollution. This potential source of pollution threatens the groundwater of Taylor County and the surface waters of the Chippewa Basin watershed.”
When the company began digging the waste pit for its first drill hole last week, the crew hit water just four feet below ground, which opponents of the project say was the groundwater and proof the area is mostly wetland. 
State regulations require that waste pits for drilling “shall not be at or below the groundwater table at the time of the drilling activity and shall be constructed such that the base will remain above the normal local groundwater elevation.”
Reimann and other opponents believe the company moving forward puts the entire watershed at risk. 
“This drilling is taking place very close to the north fork of the Yellow River,” Reimann says. “It’s taking place in vast wetlands, the hydrology is such that any kind of contamination there will affect not only the Yellow River. The Yellow River flows to the Chequamegon Waters Flowage. People up there refer to it as Miller dam, that’s a very popular camping and fishing site, as well as close to the rice beds of the Ojibwe and ultimately those waters will migrate westward to the Chippewa River, to Lake Wissota and I guess ultimately to the Black River [and] to the Mississippi. You know that water doesn’t stay in one place, so it has a huge negative impact if those waters are contaminated.” 
But Gardner says those claims aren’t accurate and is confident in the department’s regulatory and inspection processes. She says the survey conducted by the company confirmed they weren’t drilling in wetlands and the water the crews found when digging the pit is just rainwater. She says the groundwater is actually 20 feet below the surface. 
The company’s wetland study was partially done as a “desk review” using maps, state data and satellite imagery. A field study by the company was conducted later, but “soils were not investigated,” and “WDNR Wetland Soils & Indicators (WSI) are prevalent across nearly the entire site,” a company memo states. 
“We’re looking at the access, we’re looking at the drilling operation, the sumps, the security, the safety, and everything that’s going on,” Gardner says. “We’re regulating, we’re inspecting that they follow their exploration plan.” 
She says that throughout the drilling process, which includes eight holes as part of the first phase and an additional 15 holes in the second phase, the DNR will have stormwater inspectors, exploration inspectors and Gardner herself on site at regular intervals and for occasional unannounced inspections. 
“It’s not common for the DNR to be able to go on site continuously with any type of construction projects,” Gardner says. “So mining and mining-related projects are allowed to have extra inspections to really ensure that things are going according to plan, because it is an important topic and it’s an important project, so we have more resources to do additional inspections for mining in relation to other types of construction projects.” 
Donahue, the company board member, says the company has been working with local officials and community members to keep them aware of what’s happening on the site and that the project will follow all “applicable regulations.” 
“The Green Light exploration team has been working diligently with the Wisconsin DNR and the U.S. Forest Service to secure all necessary permits and approvals for the exploration program,” he says. Green Light will work diligently to properly abandon the boreholes with the proper amount of cement in accordance with applicable regulations and permits.  In addition, the drill cuttings will be properly disposed by mixing the cuttings with cement in accordance with applicable regulations and permit requirements.”

(Getty Images)Fourth of July celebrations this week will come at a slightly higher cost than last year’s cookouts, according to the Indiana Farm Bureau. 
Feeding a group of ten will cost $71.49, or $7.15 per person — which is 5% more than what Hoosiers paid in 2024. Additionally, cookouts in Indiana will cost an estimated 6 cents more than the U.S. average, which sits at $7.09 per person. 
“Inflation is slowing slightly, prices are leveling out and supply chain issues that have been prevalent for the last few years are slowly getting worked out, so we are seeing just a slight increase in prices compared to the last few years here in Indiana,” said INFB Chief Economist Dr. Todd Davis in a release.
That $71.49 includes ground beef, cheese, hamburger buns, pork chops, chicken breasts, pork and beans, potato salad, strawberries, chips, ice cream, cookies and lemonade. 
Ice cream and strawberries saw the biggest increase between 2024 and 2025, growing by 31% and 19%, respectively — similar to the national cost increase. Hamburger buns and lemonade cost the average Hoosier roughly 8% less than their national peers.
  The Indiana Farm Bureau included the following items in their cookout baskets. (Graphic from the Indiana Farm Bureau)
Two main meat dishes are also slightly cheaper for Hoosiers this year: ground beef and pork chops. Ground beef fell from $13.88 for two pounds down to $13.81 while three pounds of pork chops will cost Hoosiers $14.57 this year — compared to $15.76 last year. 
“When you’re shopping, look for the bargains on the protein side,” said Davis. “According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there’s more pork in cold storage so the prices you’re seeing at the supermarket are generally going to be a bit lower. Ground beef, on the other hand, our shoppers found the price to be just about the same as last year, which is encouraging because cattle herd numbers remain low across the country.”
The federal agency estimates that 16 cents of every dollar spent on food goes back to farmers, with the rest paying for processing, packaging, distribution and food service preparation. 
“Farmers are price takers, not price makers – just like consumers,” said Janis Highley, an INFB vice president. “Margins are still tight for farmers due to high supply costs because the amount farmers are being paid isn’t covering that increase in expenses.
But Indiana farmers are committed to streamlining their operations to decrease costs of production as best they can, all while providing safe, affordable food not just for Hoosiers, but for families all over the world.”
Volunteer shoppers researched prices for their cookouts in early June throughout the state, collecting prices on the selected food items from their local grocery stores. They were directed to look for the best possible price without using a promotional coupon or purchase deal.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)Covering Oklahoma’s Legislature for over a decade, it’s difficult not to feel cynical about the end of session and all the work left undone because they focused on inconsequential or unnecessary priorities.
So back in February before this year’s legislative session, I suggested several common-sense ideas that our lawmakers could adopt. These would actually make our state a better place with increased accountability for taxpayer spending, banning school personnel from beating disabled children and preventing adults from preying on children.
As that final gavel fell on May 30, signaling the end of the first session of the 60th Legislature, I decided to assess how many of those goals they had actually accomplished. Since lawmakers are obsessed with school performance, I decided to grade them on how well they did addressing those ideas.
Raising the age of consent:  A+  At long last, lawmakers decided to raise the age of sexual consent from 16 to 18, making Oklahoma one of about a dozen states that has adopted policies aimed at protecting children from predators. Oddly enough though, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt didn’t endorse the law by penning his name to the measure. Instead, it automatically  became law because he took no action. The measure seems to adequately protect teenagers who are having sexual relations with each other while protecting them for 50-year-old creeps trying taking advantage of them.
Banning corporal punishment in school on disabled children: A+  The measure prohibiting schools from administering physical discipline on children with federally protected disabilities limped its way across the finish line following yet another incredibly embarrassing public discussion that attempted to use the Bible to justify the practice. Yet when it arrived on Stitt’s desk, he also inexplicably refused to sign this one, allowing it instead to take effect without his signature. The practice has technically been banned by the state Department of Education since 2020, but lawmakers indicated that some districts are still spanking, choking and beating disabled children. Supporters argued that the ban needed to be codified into law.
Private school voucher-like tax credits: F  It was an embarrassing session for Republicans’ controversial private school tax credit program as Oklahomans got their first peek at who is benefiting. Lawmakers pitched the program as helping poorer students who need to escape struggling districts. But in what amounted to a surprise to nobody — except apparently naive Republican legislators — we learned that 92% of participants already had children in private schools and those from families making over $250,000 a year made up 1 in 4 participants. Thankfully Republicans wised up a bit and rebuffed calls from Stitt to eliminate the program’s $250 million spending cap all together. However, they still raised spending on the program by $50 million to top out the program’s spending at $250 million. Republicans also did not institute an income cap on who can participate, so taxpayers continue to subsidize the richest Oklahomans who least need financial support even while cutting funding to CareerTech.
Accountability for private schools accepting those tax credits: F Legislators still refuse to require private schools that accept state money to undergo the same rigorous testing and report cards that we require of our public schools, so how do we know we’re getting good bang for buck? As if that isn’t enough, lawmakers went a step further this year to muddy the accountability waters by cheerfully voting to hide the names of people accepting as much as $7,500 in state subsidies. The state Tax Commission had barely published a list of those who had received hundreds of millions in our tax dollars before lawmakers freaked out, insisting “family privacy” trumps fiscal transparency in Oklahoma. They conveniently ignored the fact that nobody is being forced to apply for these funds, this secrecy flies in the face of how we treat other tax credit program recipients, and taxpayers deserve to know who is accepting government handouts. Stitt happily inked his name on that bill. Why are lawmakers so terrified to prove that this is money well spent?
Incentivizing good, experienced teachers to want to work in Oklahoma classrooms:  C  Much to the disappointment of early- and mid-career educators, lawmakers did not boost the salaries of all classroom teachers. They did extend the salary schedule to 35 years, meaning a teacher with 35 years experience can now make no less than $60,973 a year. Previously, the salary schedule capped out at 25 years or a minimum of $56,049. Lawmakers also opened Oklahoma’s Promise college scholarship program, which pays resident tuition at a public college, to classroom teachers with at least a decade of experience. Lawmakers again did nothing to boost support staff pay.
Early voting access: F We have the worst voter turnout rates in the country, and will continue to do so after lawmakers conveniently “forgot” the fact that their constituents waited for hours in line during the last election to vote. Going into session, there was bipartisan enthusiasm surrounding the idea of expanding the early voting window to increase access. But those went nowhere this year. Now a little more than a year out from the state’s major election cycle, in which we’ll elect a new governor and new legislative members, Republicans have shown they’re perfectly happy with low turnout.
If you’re keeping track, that brings the Oklahoma Legislature to about a C average grade for the session. Here’s hoping they can bring up their GPA and our state’s overall quality of life next year. 
I’ll have my grading pen ready.

But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Idaho rancher Jay Smith has a wolf problem.
Over the last 20 years, Smith said wolves have killed more than 200 of his cattle and caused major financial harm to his family’s business.
﻿
“At today’s value at nearly $2,000 a head, times that by 200 and see if we could have invested that money over time what would that have been?” Smith said. “Significant.”
Smith and his wife, Chyenne, raise Black Angus cattle near the town of Carmen, a tiny community near the Continental Divide, just west of the Montana border.
Jay grew up nearby; his family has been ranching in the area since 1924.
Last year, the family celebrated its centennial on the land.
But their history goes back even longer.
Smith has a family history book documenting cattle ownership back to the 1600s.
“So my family’s cattle raising lineage goes way back,” Smith said.
There’s something else that goes way back in Smith’s family: Warnings about wolves that have been passed down through the generations.
 Idaho rancher ‘got to be a cowboy every day’ of his life

The J Lazy S Angus Ranch is situated in a green valley set in the shadows of high mountain peaks, some of which rise above 10,000 feet.
Wildfire smoke often hangs in the air during the summer. And on the other side of the valley, the Salmon River cuts through the landscape.

The ranch features a classic red barn, a horse corral, an assortment of farm machinery and a renovated old cabin surrounded by shade trees.
They have a small herd of Morgan-Quarter Horse crossbreeds and an array of cattle dogs that go everywhere with the Smiths, including high up in the surrounding mountains.
“One of the main reasons Chyenne and I bought this place is A, because ranching is in my blood,” Smith said. “But B, it’s exactly how we wanted to raise our children. I wanted them to have the work ethic and the animal husbandry background that I grew up with. I think it’s very important.”
Running cattle and working the ranch is all he’s ever known, and Smith wouldn’t trade it for anything.
“I don’t know if you ever watch TV, but I got to be a cowboy every day of my life, so I don’t know how you go wrong there,” Smith said. “(There is) a lot of freedom. These ranches are big, and so we had a lot of private property where us kids could go a long ways without getting in trouble or being in the wrong spot. And I don’t know how a city kid could ever get their head around that, but we could literally go for miles and not be somewhere we shouldn’t be.”
 Ranching and living in wolf ground zero

The Smiths’ several hundred cattle have a lot of room to roam, too.
During summers, the cows live in the high country. They spend 12 to 16 weeks each in a cow camp way up in the mountains, roaming far and wide on public land.
And that’s where they run into trouble with wolves.
Only a few ridgelines separate Smith’s ranch from wolf ground zero: one of the original sites of reintroduction 30 years ago – Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
From their porch on the ranch, Jay and Chyenne Smith can see the Diamond Moose Grazing allotment, where wolves have a track record killing and harassing livestock, Smith said.

“It’s been one of the most consistently conflicted allotments throughout the years,” Smith said.
Jay Smith was 22 years old in 1995 when the government reintroduced wolves. He has seen ranching before wolves were reintroduced and the difference the animals made after they were reintroduced.
“We worked really hard to keep (reintroduction) from happening,” Smith said. “And then when it became inevitable and we could see the writing on the wall, then we started trying to position ourselves for how to live with the inevitable. It was coming. We’ve been here 100 years. We’re not leaving. So now how do we make this work?”
 Idaho rancher affected by wolf depredation says compensation hard to come by

Not only do the wolves literally eat into their business, but every time the Smiths or other ranchers speak out or try to do something about it, they say they are vilified.
“The negativity and the hate towards ranchers is worse than the wolves, in my opinion, and it’s because the public’s been fed this fairy tale of what wolves are,” Chyenne Smith said. “And we’re the bad guys in every one of those stories.”
Jay Smith said he hasn’t seen a nickel in compensation for the livestock wolves killed.
“We have been paid for zero head ever,” he said.
Although Smith said he hasn’t been paid for any of his livestock losses, other Idaho ranchers have.

The state of Idaho has a compensation program to reimburse livestock owners the fair market value of animals that are killed by wolves or grizzly bears.
It applies to cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, chicken, llamas and even bees – basically any animal used for food or in food production.
From 2014 to 2022, the state of Idaho’s livestock compensation program paid out $687,029.50 to 299 different livestock producers for compensation for verified livestock losses, state records show.
But to be paid, livestock owners must have a confirmed wolf kill claim filed with the Office of Species Conservation each year.
“In the topography we run in, we can’t find them in time,” Smith said. “They just simply don’t come home. We’ll find a pile of bones. We’ll find wolf scat right on top of those bones. I mean, we know what happened to them. But as far as Wildlife Services coming in and being able to make a confirmation report to send to the Office of Species Conservation to put us in the reimbursement program, we are zero for 200. That’s our batting average.”
State records show that most investigations of wolf complaints don’t conclude that wolves were definitely responsible.
From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, Idaho Wildlife Services investigated 99 complaints of livestock losses blamed on wolves, state records show. About 28% of those investigations ruled wolves’ responsibility for livestock deaths were “confirmed” or “probable.”
But more than two-thirds of the wolf complaints, about 68%, were classified as “possible/unknown.” In some cases, wolves may have eaten the carcass of livestock after the animal was already dead but did kill the animal.
Smith said his losses add up.
“We have lost over 200 head of livestock in that 20-plus years to wolves,” Jay Smith said.
“One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero,” he added. “And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk. It’s very variable, and it’s very unknown. But it’s remained over the years. It hasn’t gone away. It sounds like it’s come and gone, but the wolves are still back there.”
And even if wolves don’t kill livestock like cows and sheep, even the presence of wolves can distress animals enough that they aren’t as healthy and wouldn’t be worth as much at market.
But wolf supporters say the number of livestock killed is extremely low. In Idaho, Montana and Wyoming wolves are confirmed to have killed an average of less than 300 domestic animals per year – out of 6 million cows and sheep in those states.
But even if the overall numbers and percentages are low, the cost is high for the farming and ranching families like the Smiths.
With 30 years of experience since reintroduction and all the claims made by wolf advocates and all the meetings with the feds, nothing has changed Smith’s mind about wolves.
He opposed reintroducing wolves, and now that they are here, Smith thinks there are too many of them. As a result, he thinks ranchers should be given broad authority to kill wolves to protect their livestock.
And as the chairman of his local county’s Republican Party central committee, Smith has helped make that happen. He said he co-wrote a 2021 state law that helped make it easier to kill more wolves by expanding when and how they can be hunted and trapped.
The law allows hunters to purchase an unlimited number of wolf tags to kill wolves and makes trapping on private land legal year round.
“There’s still people vehemently against every proposal we have,” Smith said. “And I don’t know why. We’re not out to kill them all. We’re just out to make a living and keep our livelihoods.”
Chyenne Smith agreed.
“It’s about not being able to do everything we can to protect what’s ours when we need to,” she said.
 The role trapping plays in the wolf v. livestock debate

When there are problems with wolves harassing or killing livestock, ranchers often call on trappers to catch the predators.
And one of the best people at trapping wolves is Rusty Kramer.

He’s the president of the Idaho Trappers Association and the incoming president of the National Trappers Association.

Whether it’s badgers, beavers, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, muskrats or wolves, if it’s legal to trap in Idaho, Kramer has probably caught it.
Depending on the animals, he’s used scent lures, bait or even blind set traps, hoping to entice an animal to step on a silver dollar-sized pan, which triggers the trap’s jaws to lose around the wolf’s foot and seize hold.
Once a wolf is trapped, Kramer shoots it behind the shoulder with his .22 magnum pistol, killing it. Since wolves were reintroduced, he’s trapped and killed 25 to 30.
Kramer was born and raised in Fairfield, Idaho, near the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho.
“I just learned how to trap looking over my dad’s shoulder and riding around with him and just kind of fell in love with it as a kid and I’ve been doing it ever since,” Kramer said.
It started as damage control, trapping ground squirrels and marmots, also known as rock chucks, to protect the alfalfa. Later, he moved on to coyotes and muskrats.
Kramer’s father taught him how to process and sell the pelts, stressing the importance of using every part of the animal. As a kid, the pelts put a little extra money in his pocket.
For him, trapping is a way of life and a family tradition.
Today, Kramer said the Idaho Trappers Association runs the largest fur sale in the United States, in Glenns Ferry, where a trapper can make good money for a wolf pelt.
A quality wolf pelt can go for $500 or more.
For 10 years as an adult, Kramer lived in Boise – the state’s largest city – about a 90-minute drive from Fairfield. After Micron Technology laid him off, Kramer returned to Fairfield.
But it’s tough to make a living on trapping alone, and Kramer also runs an alfalfa farm and is the watermaster for his local water district.
It’s the farm where Kramer and other farmers run into trouble with wolves. Ever since wolves came back, Kramer says, a lot more elk are hanging out in the valley where he and many other farmers grow alfalfa. He says the elk hang out there to keep safe from wolves, who tend to avoid agricultural areas because of the human presence. The elk trample the fields and eat the alfalfa, creating a headache and a cost for Rusty.
“I don’t hate wolves,” Kramer said. “I very (much) admire wolves. How far they can roam and how cunning they are and survive out there.”
But he thinks it was a mistake to reintroduce wolves to Idaho.
“I’m under the opinion it would be cool to snap your fingers and it’s back to ‘Dances with Wolves’ days,” Kramer said, referring to the 1990 movie starring Kevin Costner. “You know, where it’s buffalo from Ohio to Oregon and grizzlies and wolves. But there’s only so many places that grizzlies, wolves and buffalo can have in the 21st century, because they just roam so far. These aren’t foxes and coyotes that can live around humans.”
“There’s just not enough space for them in the 21st century, in my opinion,” Kramer said.
 Does Idaho’s Wood River Wolf Project offer a solution to protecting livestock from wolves?

Suzanne Asha Stone is trying to to demonstrate that ranchers can live side-by-side with wolves today.
Thirty years ago, Stone was an intern working on the wolf reintroduction project. Since then, she’s become a prominent wolf expert and advocate.
She is the executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project in Idaho.

Lately, Stone has been focusing on helping ranchers protect sheep and cattle without killing wolves.
Stone said the catalyst for the work was a “train wreck” of conflict between wolves and sheep in 2007 in central Idaho’s Blaine County.
Unaware that wolves were denning with pups in the area, a rancher let out his flock of sheep with some livestock guardian dogs for protection, Stone said.
“So to wolves, having those dogs come in meant that they had strange wolves coming in and were a significant threat to their pups,” Stone said. “The rancher, of course, didn’t know this. He had no idea that the wolves were there. But within 24 hours, we had dead sheep, dead livestock guardian dogs and a (wolf) pack with a death warrant on their head.”
Stone said the community came together after the event to look for a way to project sheep and wolves.
“It was at that time that the residents of Blaine County pushed back hard and said, ‘We really enjoy having wolves here. We had our own little Yellowstone happening right in our backyard, where we could go out and watch these wolves and their pups, and we want to keep them alive,’” Stone said.
From there, Stone sat down at the table with ranchers in the area, as well as an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services.
Stone said just about everyone was skeptical, even wolf biologists who wanted to keep more wolves alive.
“And so we sat down with all of them and then reached out to the ranchers and just said, ‘Let us try these nonlethal tools. Now everybody’s telling us we’re going to fail, but let’s try and see what happens,’” Stone said.
Stone started using something called fladry.
It’s nothing more than a barrier of waving flags, but it has proven successful to deter wolves in Eastern Europe and help sell high-mileage Hondas stateside.
“It looks like the flagging that sits around used car lots, basically,” Stone said. “It doesn’t look intimidating to us at all. Wolves don’t like it. They don’t trust it. And so we were able to keep the sheep behind those fladry pens for the rest of the season without having a single other loss. And the wolves were right there raising their pups for a good part of that summer. No more incidents at all.”
Stone’s critics called it beginner’s luck and questioned whether she could replicate her results over long periods of time or large areas.
That led to the creation of the Wood River Wolf Project, which for the last 17 summers has been partnering with ranchers in the area to use non-lethal tools and techniques to protect sheep from wolves.
The project area covers about 4,600 square miles of rugged, mountainous terrain.
Stone says there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to wolf conflicts – different terrain, different predator behavior, even varying access to electricity can affect what works. So, she’ll try just about anything – and her group has over the years. They’ve used solar-powered strobe lights, blasted air horns, played recordings of helicopters, even had cowboys play music.
In one case, wolves were feasting on llamas at an eastern Oregon ranch. So Stone’s team set up those 20-foot air dancers you see at car lots and lit them up at night.
“So when the wolves came over the top of the hill, they saw this enormous monster up there flapping around and making all kinds of noise, and oh my gosh, they were in the next county the next day,” she said.
“We’ve only lost two wolves in the 17 years now of the project and an average of less than five sheep a year for that entire 17-year period,” Stone said. “So it’s the lowest loss of livestock to wolves in any area where wolves and livestock overlap in the Western United States, probably beyond that. It’s a very successful project, and we use less money than what they do to kill wolves outside of the project area, where they’re losing more livestock there.”
But Stone hasn’t convinced everyone. In fact, one key holdout is her own state government.
Even when nonlethal methods of wolf control are available, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s written policy preference is to kill wolves to reduce the overall wolf population in the state.
“A lot of what we’ve learned here is being applied in countries all over the world, just not in the state of Idaho, and not to any real extent beyond our project area, because the state is so determined to kill wolves rather than to live with them,” Stone said.

New rules allow members of the public and state employees to go armed in government buildings, with exceptions including courthouses and law enforcement facilities. 
The post Concealed carry allowed in many Wyoming state government buildings starting Tuesday appeared first on WyoFile .","Starting Tuesday, Wyomingites will be allowed to carry guns into state government buildings, with some exceptions including courthouses and law enforcement facilities.
On June 17, the Wyoming State Building Commission — composed of the governor, treasurer, state auditor, secretary of state and superintendent of public education — adopted rules allowing concealed carry in most state government buildings in preparation for a new law that takes effect Tuesday repealing “gun-free” zones in government buildings.
The new rules mark a major expansion of where citizens can carry firearms as they conduct business with their government. That expansion comes at the behest of the Legislature and over the objections of Gov. Mark Gordon, who sought to implement concealed carry into Wyoming’s state buildings through a rule-making process overseen by the building commission. But lawmakers passed their repeal bill with a veto-proof majority this year. Gordon nixed a previous version in 2024.
The Legislature’s drive to open state government buildings to armed citizens coincides with concerns about increased political violence in America. Earlier this month, a man assassinated a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband and nearly killed another lawmaker and his partner. That violence came on the heels of an arson attack on Pennsylvania’s governor, and months after a campaign season in which two people tried to assassinate President Donald Trump. 
Lawmakers who pushed for the concealed carry bill, which passed the Senate with a 25-6 vote and the House with a 50-10 vote, believe allowing citizens to go armed and defend themselves is the antidote to such violence. Opponents fear more guns in more places will lead to more deaths and injuries, both accidental and deliberate.
This winter, public areas of the Wyoming State Capitol were opened to concealed carry. You do not need a permit to concealed carry a lawfully purchased firearm in the Equality State.
Separately, the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information issued a new policy allowing state employees to concealed carry but required them to store firearms in a locked box when it is not on their person.

That policy does not require employees to have taken gun safety or active shooter courses, though it says they are “strongly encouraged” to do so. 
Exceptions to the new rules include the Wyoming Judiciary, where bailiffs go armed but members of the public are forbidden to carry weapons into courtrooms. The public is also not allowed to carry firearms into facilities primarily used by law enforcement, including jails, prisons and agency offices like those of the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation. 
Concealed carry will also remain prohibited in treatment facilities operated by the health department and field offices of the Wyoming Department of Family Services. Those exceptions were all included in the Legislature’s repeal bill. 
Around the state, Wyoming school boards have struggled to write new policies to conform with the law, which also forced the allowance of concealed carry in public schools. That response on a local level has highlighted the political differences between counties, WyoFile reported in collaboration with news outlets around the state.
The process for state government has been more subdued. The State Building Commission’s emergency meeting to adopt the new rules featured only one public commenter, who brought to officials a concern about a piece of wording in the law he thought violated legislative intent. The Wyoming Public Employee Association, which represents state workers across different agencies, didn’t take a position, Executive Director Betty Jo Beardsley told WyoFile.
Her members fall on both sides of the debate about whether gun-free zones are safer or targets for people who want to do harm, she said.
The emergency rules may only last until July 9, Wyoming State Building Commission Secretary Suzanne Nelson told WyoFile in an interview Wednesday. On that day, the five elected officials are scheduled to meet again and are likely to adopt permanent rules that echo the emergency rules going into effect Tuesday. 
Though lawmakers had given the executive branch 30 days to implement rules after the law went into effect, Nelson said officials wanted to have rules in place when the law took effect.  
Posted signs of a “no” symbol over the silhouette of a handgun will indicate those buildings or spaces within buildings where concealed carry is prohibited, Nelson said.

The predictable outcome is a further funneling of wealth into the pockets of high earners, at the direct expense of the already threadbare social safety net that supports communities across our nation, argues Pete Gosar.
The post Rural health clinics like mine will bear the burden of Congress’s Medicaid cuts appeared first on WyoFile .","The “$1.5 trillion in tax cuts” that Congress’s “Big Beautiful Bill” seeks to extend is not merely a fiscal policy; it is a profound sacrifice. 

Opinion

This sacrifice will not be borne by those who stand to gain, but by the very fabric of our society: our key social programs like Medicaid and SNAP benefits. The predictable outcome is a further funneling of wealth into the pockets of high earners, at the direct expense of the already threadbare social safety net that supports communities across our nation. As the director of a free primary care facility, I am dismayed by the callous lack of compassion Congress is demonstrating for financially strapped Americans.
The burden of care, inevitably, will fall upon the shoulders of free clinics like the Downtown Clinic in Laramie, where I have worked for over a decade. For the low-income, uninsured individuals we serve — those without Medicare, Medicaid, or VA benefits — the emergency room is often their only other recourse. We strive to provide high-quality, integrated healthcare, but when the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill would remove 10.9 million people from Medicaid and 5.1 million from the Affordable Care Act, it forces a chilling question: Where will these 16 million vulnerable Americans go?
In America today, 2 million people already receive essential care through free clinics like ours. Last year alone, the Free Clinic Association reported 6 million patient visits. We are proud to do this vital work, and 90% of our funding is derived from privately raised dollars. But how, I ask, do you expect an additional 12 to 16 million people to enter this system without a shred of additional financial support? This puts clinics like ours in an utterly precarious situation. It is, as I see it, nothing less than a cost shift from the federal government, designed solely to funnel tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. That is not the America I believe in.
The damage extends catastrophically to rural healthcare. It’s estimated that this bill will lead to over $50 billion in lost Medicaid reimbursements over the next 10 years. The proposed $15 billion rural healthcare fund is, quite frankly, a disingenuous band-aid — an admission by our representatives in Congress that they recognize the harm this bill will inflict upon rural communities. This meager fund doesn’t begin to cover the projected losses, nor will it prevent the eventual shutdown of vital rural hospitals. If Congress truly wished to support rural healthcare, they would ensure people have access to healthcare in the first place, rather than offering inadequate props after inflicting such profound damage.
The America I was raised to believe in is one that values communities and supports neighbors. Growing up in Wyoming, at an elevation of 7,000 feet, if you saw a car on the side of the road in the winter, it could literally be a life-or-death situation. You didn’t hesitate; you pulled over, checked on them, offered help, a tow, or a ride to town. You checked in on your neighbors, feeding their animals when they were away. The values of looking out for each other, of community responsibility, are core to Americans, especially in rural communities. We must continue to embody that spirit.
This bill does not. There is a direct, undeniable line from the cuts in Medicaid and SNAP benefits to the enrichment of the richest few. Is this truly what Congress desires for our nation? I believe the American public does not want more income inequality. They want a country where we care for our neighbors, where a social safety net supports those in need, and where healthcare is a right, not a privilege reserved for the wealthy. 
It’s time for Congress to listen to the American people and reconsider a bill that fundamentally betrays our shared values.

(Photo by Clare Fieseler/ Canary Media)Gary Yerman, 75, sat nervously in a noisy ballroom in Virginia Beach, Virginia, counting down the minutes until he could shed his ill-fitting double-breasted suit for a sun shirt and blue jeans. He introduced himself as a fisherman of 50 years to a stranger seated next to him at the banquet table.
“That sounds really hard,” the other man replied. 
“Not as hard as it’s going to be to go accept this award and talk to a room full of people,” joked Yerman. Moments later, his name was called, and he walked onto a professionally lit stage to accept a small crystal trophy from the Oceantic Network, a leading trade group for the burgeoning multibillion-dollar U.S. offshore wind industry.
It was an unlikely sight. America’s fishermen have long treated wind developers as their sworn enemies. 
The conflict started in the early 2000s, when the first plans for New England’s offshore wind areas were sketched out. In packed town hall meetings that often devolved into shouting matches, fishermen claimed the projects would make it harder to earn a living: fewer fishing grounds, fewer fish, damaged ocean habitat. 
Few of these predictions have come to pass in places like the U.K., which has already built over 50 offshore wind farms in its waters. Wind areas there are thriving with sharks and serving as a surprising habitat for haddock. But even today, fisher-led groups in the U.S. are spearheading lawsuits aiming to halt at least two offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast. One former offshore wind executive told Canary Media that the amount of pushback from fishermen in America has made offshore wind investments riskier than in Europe.
Yerman was one of the first fishermen in the U.S. to cross this bitter divide. He’s become the reluctant face of a group of over 100 fishermen and fisherwomen who go by the name Sea Services North America. They’ve decided to work for offshore wind farms — not against them. Doing so supplements their income from scalloping, a centuries-old bedrock of the New England fishing economy that has seen revenues dry up. 
Pursuing work in wind power has come at a cost. After the awards event, back in blue jeans and with a celebratory beer in hand, Yerman recounted the exact word New England fishermen used when he and his crew first crossed the Rubicon.
“They called us traitors,” he said.  
Those tensions have become supercharged with the election of President Donald Trump, who has called offshore wind “garbage” and “bullshit” and, in the weeks leading up to his inauguration, pledged that​ “no new windmills” would be built in the U.S. during his presidency. He’s backed up those words with action since taking office, stopping new projects from proceeding and attempting to block some of the country’s eight fully permitted offshore wind projects, too. 
Yerman and his crew are left wondering if the industry they’ve bet their livelihood on — and work they’ve risked their reputations for — will all come crashing down. 
Many of the fishermen who work through Sea Services voted for Trump. And if the president fulfills his promise to halt the industry, it would be devastating not only for the Northeast’s climate goals and grid reliability — but for thousands of workers in the region, from electricians to welders to Sea Services’ fishermen.
One of Sea Services’ captains, Kevin Souza, put it simply: The impact would be “big time.”
“Everyone was skeptical”
Six years ago, Yerman was like the others — angry with offshore wind developers, particularly Danish giant Ørsted, which had set up shop in his hometown of New London, Connecticut. 
Concerned that wind turbines might push his son out of the scalloping business, he pulled one of the only levers he could think to pull and contacted his state senator at the time, Paul Formica, a Republican who owned a local seafood restaurant. 
Formica wanted to see the two sides get along. He arranged a meeting between Yerman and an Ørsted executive named Matthew Morrissey, who happened to be a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, the most lucrative commercial fishing port in America.

Yerman found in Morrissey a sympathetic ear, and in turn, he listened to what the executive had to say — that Ørsted was open to partnering with fishermen. Morrissey had seen, with his own eyes, fishers working for and coexisting with Ørsted in a tiny port in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. The energy firm had a team of about two dozen marine affairs employees, Morrissey relayed, who could help make something like that happen in America if Yerman was on board. He pitched it as a win-win. 
“Everyone knows that fishermen hate offshore wind companies. Well, guess what? Offshore wind companies hate fishermen, too,” Morrissey, who no longer works at Ørsted, told Canary Media earlier this year. “Our goal here is to spread the understanding that these two industries can and do and will work together.”
The idea intrigued Yerman. In the U.S., profits from scalloping have fluctuated from year to year, and, following a crash in the 1990s, scallop numbers remain unpredictable. In his view, if offshore wind companies were moving into their waters — like it or not — they might as well make some money from it. 
Yerman got to work. 
His first call was to Gordon Videll, a longtime friend and affable small-town lawyer, who knew things about contracts that Yerman didn’t. The two flew to Kilkeel — on their own dime — to see the model for themselves. Videll noticed that some of Kilkeel’s fishermen were driving cars nicer than his. He and Yerman were inspired.  
When they returned to Connecticut, Yerman recruited about a half dozen of his commercial fishing buddies, and Videll started putting together the paperwork. They dubbed themselves Sea Services North America and in 2020 landed their first small contract, with Ørsted. It was a pilot, said Morrissey, to see if this arrangement would work here in America. 
“Everyone was skeptical,” recalled Morrissey with a laugh. “Because their boats were in such poor safety condition. But you know what? They pulled it off.” 
Today, Sea Services operates like a co-op and has brought 22 fishing boats up to certified safety standards. With Videll at the helm as part-time CEO, the group has completed over 11 contracts in eight different wind farm areas, from Massachusetts to New Jersey. Instead of hiring ferries or work boats, developers rely on Sea Services fishermen to provide safety and scout services for offshore wind vessels. 
It’s important work: making sure, for example, no fishing gear, like crab traps, is in the way of cables, monopiles, or survey operations. If necessary, Sea Services fishermen move gear — with the owner’s approval. When not cleared, these obstacles have caused days and sometimes weeks of costly delays for developers, according to Morrissey. 
Sea Services was an “indispensable partner” in helping to build South Fork Wind, which went online last year and became America’s first large-scale offshore wind project, wrote Ed LeBlanc, a current Ørsted executive, in an email to Canary Media. The firm has since contracted the group for other projects, in no small part because of their expertise about local waters, he added.
Cooperation between these two sides — offshore wind and commercial fishing — does exist elsewhere in America. For example, Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, the codevelopers of the Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out $8 million directly to local fishermen unaffiliated with Sea Services for similar safety jobs over the past two years.
But Sea Services is unique. Today the group offers an expansive network of 22 partner vessels based in six states and is led by a commercial fisherman. Videll brought on new technology, allowing developers to track their work in real time. He said they adopted a co-op model to maximize the amount of money going into participants’ pockets. 
Receiving the Oceantic Network award in late April was a big deal for the collective, said Videll. It’s an example of how successful the venture has been in a short period of time — and, more importantly, it should be good for business. Industry awards mean visibility. More visibility could mean more Sea Services contracts.

But, right now, the Sea Services business faces headwinds that no award can help overcome. 
Since taking office in January, President Trump has launched an all-out assault on the offshore wind industry. On his first day in office, he halted new lease and permitting activity and called for a review of the nine projects that already had their federal permits in hand. In March, his Environmental Protection Agency chief revoked a key permit for Atlantic Shores, a fully permitted project that has since been called off in part due to roadblocks created by the administration. 
The most eyebrow-raising step came in April, when Trump’s Interior Department issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind 1, two weeks after the project had begun at-sea construction.
It was a wake-up call for Sea Services, which works for Norwegian energy giant Equinor on the project. Videll, Sea Services’ CEO, said at the time that the cessation of Empire Wind would be a crushing blow that could cost the co-op a total of $9 million to $12 million worth of work. 
In May, the administration suddenly lifted the stop-work order. Sea Services’ contract was safe, at least for the time being. But it was the most bracing illustration yet that the business, in spite of all its success, now faces very choppy waters under the Trump administration. 
Taking a risk
On a cloudless late-February day at the New Bedford port, 57-year-old Souza hovered over a checklist and laptop in the captain’s quarters of the Pamela Ann. Souza is the captain of the boat, and he needed to make sure everything was in order before he and his crew left New Bedford that afternoon. They’d be at sea for 10 days, working in many of the spots Souza had fished in for decades. 
Those 10 days at sea would not be spent dredging up scallops from the seafloor and tallying their catch, however, but conducting safety operations for the Revolution Wind offshore wind project, which is being built off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
The hulking scalloping boat, with its ebony-painted hull and wood-paneled interior, was bustling ahead of the journey. In the galley, Souza’s 25-year-old son, one of the three mates onboard, sorted through the food they’d need. Jack Morris, a 73-year-old scalloper and Sea Services manager, paced around the Pamela Ann checking in on its recently updated safety assets, like a new tracking beacon and safety suits. 
Trips like these have become a lifeline for Souza, his crew, and an increasing number of fishermen who depend on the struggling scalloping industry. 
Today, there are roughly 350 vessels sitting in ports from Maine to North Carolina that have licenses to harvest sea scallops. For several decades, East Coast scallopers managed to eke out a comfortable middle-class lifestyle on scalloping alone. Morris said that “years ago” he’d pull in $200,000 to $300,000 of profit annually as a scallop boat captain.
“Yeah, those days are gone,” scoffed Morris. 
While the price of scallops remains high, making it one of the most lucrative U.S. fisheries, rules passed over the last 30 years have restricted when and where scallopers can harvest, resulting in fewer days at sea, fewer scallops caught — and less money for the entire industry.

Souza has mixed emotions about the regulations.
On the one hand, scallops are no longer being overfished. A 2024 third-party audit of the fishery said it “meets the requirements for a well-managed and sustainable fishery.” In fact, for over a decade, U.S. sea scallops sold on grocery store shelves have carried a little blue-check label — the mark of a seafood certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.
But most scallop fishermen are now limited to an extremely short window of time during which they can harvest scallops— in 2025, it was just 24 days. Some of their favorite fishing grounds are regularly closed for scallop recovery. There are simply fewer scallops to go around. Souza estimates that captains who stick to scalloping alone are making half of what they did in years past: “They’re probably lucky to make a hundred [thousand].”
Offshore wind work has helped fishermen like Souza and Morris ease the sting of that lost income. 
Across Revolution Wind’s two-year construction window, Souza expects to make over $200,000 as a part-time boat captain. For the younger generation, who Souza said as deckhands can expect to make only around $30,000 per year from scalloping, offshore wind work makes it possible to keep earning a middle-class wage. 
In the past year, Souza has recruited to Sea Services both of his sons, his nephew, and a few other young folks from longtime fishing families who might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income.
“This wind farm business is the number one way for scallop guys, captains, mates, deckhands, to make extra money,” said Morris.
It’s also helping to revitalize the port of New Bedford, a city of 100,000 that is not only the most valuable fishing port in America but also a place of tremendous historic importance to the industry. It was once the epicenter of the whaling world and serves as the backdrop for the opening scenes of Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick.” 
In just 10 years, the offshore wind industry has ushered in a transformation the city hadn’t seen “since the whaling era,” according to Jon Mitchell, the city’s mayor since 2011. 
The companies building Vineyard Wind now stage their offshore wind infrastructure in New Bedford. Their presence has brought a flood of public and private funding to the city, with over $1.2 billion already invested and pledged to help give the terminals, docks, and harbor a facelift, according to Mitchell.

For all the money offshore wind has brought to the city — and into the pockets of locals like Souza and Morris — offshore wind remains highly controversial among many commercial fishermen in New Bedford. 
That’s in spite of Mitchell’s insistence that, when push comes to shove, New Bedford’s local government will always side with scalloping. 
Still, Mitchell, one of New England’s fiercest offshore wind defenders, remains unpopular with many down at the boat docks. “I’ve put myself in the loneliest place in American politics, which is right in the middle. Between offshore wind and commercial fishing,” he said. 
Trump flags, full pockets
The fishermen who take part in Sea Services also float in that lonely place. 
It’s not uncommon for them to face harassment from other fishermen over the radio when out on the water, Yerman said. One time, he said a Sea Services fisherman was turned away from a Rhode Island dock, in what Yerman characterized as an act of revenge. 
The hardest part of Yerman’s job is overcoming this cultural aversion and getting fishermen to the table, convincing them that working for the offshore wind developers is a way to sustain a livelihood whose viability has begun to fade.  
“You’ll have the lobster guys and they’ll say shit to you — like, ‘traitor.’ Or ‘Trump’s gonna shut that down, ha ha ha,’” Souza said, imitating the taunts he receives over the marine radio bolted to the wall near the helm of the Pamela Ann. 
The lobstermen have a point regarding Trump. As frustrating as their remarks may be, the biggest threat to offshore wind is not snipes from colleagues, but the actions of a president who many Sea Services members — including Souza — voted for.

As Souza prepared to leave the New Bedford port in February to go help Ørsted build giant wind turbines in the ocean, something Trump swore would not happen during his term, he explained his support for the president.
“Trust me, I want Trump to ‘drill, drill, drill.’ I’m all for it,” said Souza of the president’s plans to expand oil and gas production. 
But he still thinks offshore wind is necessary to get more power onto New England’s grid and lower energy costs. Experts say that the federal permitting process for offshore wind in America takes too long — about four years. But, in the Northeast region, according to energy analyst Christian Roselund, finishing the deployment of the offshore wind projects already in the permitting pipeline will be much faster than starting up new nuclear or fossil-gas power plants.  
“Once we ‘drill, drill, drill,’ you’re still gonna need more electricity,” Souza said. “Where are you gonna get it? My electric bill at my house is stupid high!”
Most of the fishermen in New Bedford are Trump supporters, he insisted. Morris, who also voted for Trump, agreed. Overall, Trump won 46% of the city’s votes in last November’s election — a much higher proportion than his Massachusetts statewide total of 36.5%. The “TRUMP 2024” flags flown from the dozens of scallop boats docked across New Bedford’s port underscored the point. A few of those Trump flag-flying boats even work for the offshore wind companies, Morris claims. The Pamela Ann, for its part, does not have a Trump flag. 
“I support Trump even though I know he’s against wind. … I believe this will still be around,” said Souza, gesturing toward the ocean, where somewhere over the horizon an array of wind towers was being erected. “He’s gonna see the light.” 
Trump, of course, has not seen the light — though he did revoke his stop-work order against Empire Wind. 
After being grounded for a month, Sea Services fishermen began operations on Empire Wind again in early June, when the project resumed at-sea work. The co-op’s members are helping Equinor’s construction vessels lay boulders on the seafloor to stabilize all 54 wind towers that will be raised over the next two years and eventually supply much-needed carbon-free power to New York City. 
But nothing is certain. When the Trump administration unpaused the project, it left open the door to stopping it again — or killing it altogether. A May letter from the Interior Department to Equinor noted that it is still conducting an “ongoing review” to determine if the project’s permits were “rushed” and therefore illegitimate in the eyes of the Trump administration. 
Meanwhile, a coalition of a dozen fishing companies and several anti-offshore wind groups typically allied with Trump sued the administration on June 3, just days before Empire Wind restarted at-sea construction, in an attempt to reinstate the stop-work order. The move came weeks after wind opponents asked Trump to also pause Revolution Wind, one of the more lucrative contracts Sea Services holds.
In his opposition to offshore wind, Trump has positioned himself as a defender of the commercial fishing industry, claiming falsely at a May 2024 campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, for example, that the turbines “cause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales.”  
But for the increasing number of fishermen working with offshore wind companies, halting the industry would not help — it would crush a financial lifeline.
Not long ago, in 2017, Sea Services captain Rodney Avila remembers being one of the only fishers in New Bedford willing to seize this lifeline. He recalled with a laugh what a long-time fisherman friend said to him then: “When you put that first wind turbine up there … we’re going to hang you from it!”
Times have changed. In the New Bedford area, almost 50 local fishing vessels have performed some kind of safety or scouting work for Vineyard Wind. At least one captain lowers his MAGA-supporting flag before setting out to work on the projects the president has sworn to stop, according to Avila. He said politics has always been tangled up in fishing. And work is work. 
“They don’t care whether it’s red, or blue, or whatever color. … They don’t care,” Avila shrugged, while sipping coffee inside a Dunkin’. Five scalloping boats bobbed on calm water just beyond the parking lot. “It’s money that they need to support their families, wherever it comes from.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3738-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

Bill Lee signs his signature private school voucher law. (Photo: John Partipilo/ Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee House Republican says the legislature should require the Department of Education to provide more information about private-school voucher applicants for a thorough evaluation of the new program.
Parents applying for the money don’t have to disclose where their children attended school previously, and the state is refusing to provide that information or even the counties where students live. 
Additionally, applications for “universal” vouchers, those without an income cap, don’t require parents to list financial information.
Lawmakers who opposed the program are raising questions about what they perceive as critical information as the state offers nearly $7,300 each to 20,000 students to enroll in private schools, at a total cost of $146 million. Half the recipients, 10,000, have financial limits at 300% of the federal poverty level, an estimated $175,000 for a family of four, while the families of the remainder face no income restrictions.
  “It seems fairly clear that the (Lee) administration does not want to know these things,” said Rep. Jody Barrett, R-Dickson, of a lack of information released on private school voucher applicants. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“It seems fairly clear that the administration does not want to know these things because they’re afraid it may not line up with the narrative that was put out there for the reason they were supporting this measure,” Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson told the Lookout.
Numerous lawmakers said during debate they supported the private-school vouchers to help struggling parents send their children to better schools.
Chalkbeat initially reported on the matter and found two-thirds or more of the students in Alabama and Florida who received voucher funds already attended private schools.
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is among the lawmakers trying to obtain what he called “basic” information about the voucher program to make sure it complies with the law.
“They’re giving out checks like Cash for Clunkers,” Hemmer said, comparing it to a 2009 federal rebate program designed to bolster the economy and encourage people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.  
Lawmakers narrowly passed Gov. Bill Lee’s main initiative this year even though the state’s own financial impact analysis showed 65% of the students who receive the vouchers would be enrolled in private schools already. Students from private schools surrounded the governor when he signed the bill into law at the State Capitol.
Barrett, who voted against the measure this year, said he requested information about students’ previous enrollment and home counties after the Education Department’s first release showed only ZIP codes. Barrett added that he asked the department to provide the home counties for applicants so lawmakers could assess the demand and tailor the program to serve students.
In contrast, the state’s Education Savings Account program for low-income students in Metro Nashville, Memphis and Chattanooga requires parents to provide financial information.
“This department just seems like they’re intent on intentionally not understanding those things. Or they’re not disclosing that information,” Barrett said.
Tennessee legislature puts hundreds of millions toward private-school vouchers

The second-term lawmaker said the legislature should form a board to oversee the program or request a study by a group such as the Tennessee Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations to allow legislators to see if they’re getting a “bang for their buck.”
State Rep. Mark White, chairman of the House Education Administration Committee, told the Lookout he needs to ask the department why it’s not asking for financial information on “universal” scholarships, because it is required by the bill.
The governor’s office said the law doesn’t require the state to collect information on previous enrollment, Chalkbeat reported.
White said he spoke with officials at one private school in Memphis who told him 80% of those receiving the funds were enrolled there already.
Yet he defended the program, saying it can benefit middle-class families whose children attend private schools in Memphis with tuition costs in the $15,000 range.
The Department of Education sent out a release in late May saying it received 38,000 applications for the voucher program, about half coming from families who qualify based on their income. 
The Education Department did not respond to questions from the Lookout about the program. Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds has not taken questions from the media in more than a year but said in the May release that demand is strong for “universal school choice.”
“All students deserve the ability to access a learning environment that best fits their unique needs,” Reynolds said in the release.
Besides the cost of the vouchers, this year’s bill contained a provision requiring local school boards to approve one-time $2,000 bonuses for teachers at a total cost of $198 million. The state is spending another $2.6 million to hire 11 people to oversee the program and $625,000 to contract with Student First Technologies to handle the online financial portion of the program.

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The average person’s approach to politics specifically, and the world around them generally, has fundamentally shifted in the 21st century, separating us into “teams” of adversaries. 
The reasons for this cannot be laid out in a black and white, causal approach. 
We do know that technology, such as social media, has had an effect, while a reliance on media content over real-world experience also contributes. Regardless, the danger is still there. What we have done, as a society, may have coalesced all the advancements of the modern age and allowed us to actually digress back to a time when human survival was based on allegiance to one’s tribe. 
Modern humans no longer have the same dangers as our nomadic ancestors, but that privilege has allowed us to take those instincts and manufacture crises or issues across tribes that result in a team vs. team dialectic, complete with merchandise, uniforms, winners, and losers. 
We’ve ‘gamified’ our society and it is to our detriment. We actively participate in ritual tribalism but the stakes, in our myopic view, are not severe. It’s a game.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Michigan, we understand tribalism all too well. As a person of a certain age that was told he was to be a Detroit Lions fan in the mid-1970s, I understand the process. Through the geographical circumstances of my birth, I championed a team that, by all accounts, had no right to be championed. I made excuses for their failures, celebrated their very few victories (until recent years, of course), but I never wavered. My allegiance was rewarded with being a part of a group of long-suffering people that I could identify with. 
Our devotion to the Lions, again for no other reason than where we lived, bonded us in a noble cause. We showed our allegiance by wearing the gear and flying the flags. And when other teams of people dared speak ill of the beloved Lions there could be vitriolic arguments. That is a process we are all familiar with, but the misapplication of that process into our political discourse is troubling.
Take, for example, Ted Nugent’s recent visit to the Michigan Legislature. As an avid outdoorsman and aging rocker, Nugent’s presence in front of that body was not to testify, but to chastise the members and call for wildlife conservation efforts to be further deregulated. He was asked to attend and address the lawmakers by a delegation of Republicans, not to affect policy change or bring real-world constituency issues to light, but as an armed celebrity endorsement.

From our national political fray down to local politics, these kinds of stunts are emblematic of the ‘gamification’ problem we face. Reality show presidents, newscaster cabinets, and celebrity guest stars in Lansing further the tribalistic approach and, much like trotting out a Hall of Fame quarterback from the past in order to drive ticket sales, the Nugent stunt is only a recent example.
Maybe the real culprit is Pac-Man or Zelda. As the Silent Generation and the older Boomers phase out, the generations born and bred on video games are in the majority, thus presenting anything as a winnable or losable achievement is attractive, prompting those same generations to choose sides and “play” their game. 
The gamification of our politics and our social norms isn’t new, just see earlier, historical, attempts at an ‘us vs. them’ approach to nationalism, but the current atmosphere is dangerous. 
Painting the other team as a faceless group of NPCs (non-player characters in video games, who are usually expendable and a necessary conquest for winning) further entrenches us into our tribal teams. 
The recent briefing held by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Detroit painted a crisis at Michigan’s northern border with Canada, wherein border crossers intent on harming God-fearing and innocent Michigan citizens must be stopped at all costs.

More examples can be found in the cheering and celebration of a sovereign nation bombing another sovereign nation. Just like a game of Risk, there aren’t real human beings maimed or killed, only those other players who are only as real as a voice in a headset when playing Call of Duty.
The above examples are, at their core, benign ones. Outside of mental disease or defect, the average person does not allow the winning and losing gamification of their fandom to result in violence. But what happens when the tribe raises the stakes? What happens when it changes from a sports team and to a president or prime minister? 
The gear and the flags remain the same, so the merchandise feels very game-like, but when your team believes that their very existence is at stake and the opposing team is just a character in the drama, then we have become monstrous. This has allowed us to openly celebrate the murder of fellow human beings and the destruction of homelands. Worse yet, by viewing our adversaries as nothing more than a ‘final boss’ it is so, so easy to actively pursue their defeat by any means necessary.

NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.

Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.
So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.
Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Sheyla Muñoz Garcia came to the United States from Mexico 15 years ago. All five of her children are U.S. citizens. On Friday, she became a citizen, too.
Muñoz Garcia was one of 40 new U.S. citizens who took the oath of allegiance at the William L. Guy Federal Courthouse in Bismarck to complete the final step of their naturalization process.
She said she decided to become a citizen this year to ensure that her permanent residency status could never be revoked.
“I had my green card and I was just trying to make sure my status is here, you know, because all my kids are Americans,” Muñoz Garcia said. 
She said she previously lived in Oklahoma, but decided to raise her family in North Dakota because she felt safe in the Peace Garden State.
“The kids really enjoy the outside at the farm and everything,” she said. Muñoz Garcia just gave birth to her youngest daughter 10 weeks ago and she was overjoyed to have her whole family in the courtroom to see their mother join them as citizens.

The kids are too young to understand the impact of watching her become a citizen, she said, but one of her daughters cried and pleaded with her recently, “I don’t want you to stop being Mexican.”
“I was like, ‘It’s not like that, it doesn’t go away, it’s in our blood. But we have to share great memories with the American culture, too,’” Muñoz Garcia said.
She also celebrated her 28th birthday on Friday, which she said made the naturalization ceremony a “great gift.”
Another new citizen, Jayla Crouse, is from the Philippines and has lived in the United States for seven years. She said she decided to become a citizen because her mother became one last year and she wanted to practice the same rights.
“The United States gave me a lot of opportunities here,” Crouse said. She said she’s studying to become a surgical technician at Bismarck State College and hopes to complete her coursework next year.
Olufemi Akinstan, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services representative from the Minneapolis field office, was on hand for the ceremony and ensured each new citizen had all of their naturalization paperwork before they left the building.
“It’s a joyful day for us and for the applicants,” Akinstan said.
Many of the new citizens have lived in the U.S for at least five years, he said. 
U.S. Chief Judge Peter Welte, who presided over the ceremony, told the new citizens to exercise the new rights granted to them by their citizenship, including the right to free speech, religion, assembly and the right to vote.

“These are rights that you have now,” Welte said. “And it was clear that the founders of this great land, of America, they considered that civic engagement at all levels was going to be vital to the success of this government.”
He said the group of new U.S. citizens came from countries such as Brazil, Canada, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Liberia, Mexico, Philippines, Rwanda, Uganda, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
Ceremonies earlier this week in Fargo were expected to include about 200 new citizens from 51 countries, according to the U.S. District Court.
Welte gave the citizens a brief history of the United States’ conflicts, including the Civil War and its journey of freedom and liberty since its inception. He closed his remarks with a question: How does this story end?
“It’s up to you,” he said. “Because you are now, we the people … and I urge you to make this a story that ends well.”

(Courtesy of Immunize Colorado)Many Colorado lawmakers and medical experts were already concerned about how the Trump administration could shake up vaccine recommendations and access in the state. Then Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, dismissed all 17 experts on the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, replacing them with eight new members, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.
But months before the changes at ACIP, state lawmakers approved a bill meant to insulate Colorado from vaccine policies that are inconsistent with scientific evidence. House Bill 25-1027 allows the state Board of Health to go beyond exclusively following ACIP for school vaccine requirements and consider recommendations from doctors’ groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians. It was signed into law in April.
State Sen. Lindsey Daugherty, an Arvada Democrat, was one of the bill’s sponsors. She said the provision that gives the state Board of Health more flexibility came from “discussions of what could be the worst thing that could happen (with ACIP), and how do we protect Colorado, future-looking?”
“Unfortunately, we’ve had to play on the defensive a lot in Colorado, and that’s something we take really seriously, because now, at least in Colorado, folks can look to science-based recommendations for vaccines for kids, instead of the politically-stacked ACIP,” Daugherty said.

The federal advisory committee, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is now chaired by Martin Kulldorff, a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who was fired in 2024 after declining the COVID-19 vaccine.
The committee met for the first time with its new members on Wednesday and Thursday, and voted to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines. The committee also announced it will reexamine current recommendations around childhood vaccination schedules and hepatitis B immunizations.
“Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee, issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro- or anti-vaccine box,” Kulldorff said during the commission meeting. “Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry, and it further feeds the flame of vaccine hesitancy. To thoroughly scrutinize and assure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.”










I’m glad that Colorado took these proactive steps to safeguard evidence-based vaccine recommendations.


– David Higgins, doctor at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus


But many other doctors have raised concerns. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said that, ideally, states would not need to have separate vaccine recommendations. He added that with “the dismantling of ACIP,” the Colorado law is necessary.
“I’m glad that Colorado took these proactive steps to safeguard evidence-based vaccine recommendations,” Higgins said. 
Maintaining trust in vaccines
When parents of his patients raise concerns about the safety or effectiveness of vaccines, Higgins listens to them without judgment. He clears up misconceptions, answers questions and communicates the science behind vaccines.
“We as pediatricians welcome parents’ questions and are ready to listen and try to understand and address parents’ concerns about vaccines,” Higgins said. “Vaccine hesitancy is not new.”
What is new, though, is the rapid spread of vaccine misinformation on social media, and an erosion of trust in ACIP, Higgins added.
“With the CDC and ACIP bypassing normal processes that are in place to ensure recommendations are made with scientific integrity, transparency and thoroughness, trust is going to be degraded,” Higgins said. “It’s going to lower trust in those institutions and that will trickle down to less confident recommendations and lower trust from parents.”
Higgins is on the board of Immunize Colorado, a nonprofit that focuses on vaccine education. The organization hosts vaccine information sessions at clinics and local events. 
“We are constantly doing vaccine education, and we’re not a direct vaccine provider, but we educate the community,” said Susan Lontine, Immunize Colorado’s executive director.

Vaccine access protection
Recommendations made by ACIP can directly impact which vaccines insurance companies are obligated to cover. With that in mind, Colorado lawmakers in April passed Senate Bill 25-196, another preventive care-related law.
The law empowers the state insurance commissioner to maintain the coverage of state-regulated preventive measures, including vaccines, even if ACIP recommendations change. 
State Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat, was one of the sponsors of that law, and of HB-1027. Mullica, an emergency room nurse, said it’s crucial that Coloradans get accurate information about vaccines and have affordable access to them.
“Americans are getting mixed signals and that’s really terrifying, because politics should not be in public health,” Mullica said. “We should rely on science.”
Amid significant vaccine misinformation, Kim Warner, an obstetrician and the president of the Colorado Medical Society, said one-on-one conversations between doctors and patients remain key.
“We can come out with recommendations all day long,” Warner said. “But I think sitting in the exam room and talking to patients about what vaccines are and aren’t, and what they do and what they don’t do, and answering their specific questions is one of the strongest things that we can do for patients.”

In a press release, the advocacy group Citizen Action of Wisconsin said “their flag reading the word ‘HUMAN’ in pride colors and its mount was ripped out of the side of the home and torn off of its flagpole.” 
“The flagpole had been bent, and the mounting bracket irreparably damaged,” Roe said at a press conference Thursday evening. “While we are grateful that no further property damage occurred, this incident reminds us that safety and dignity are still privileges not equally shared by all. This wasn’t just vandalism. This was a message.”
A local organizer told the Examiner that isn’t an isolated incident in the area, and speakers at the press conference talked about the impact of Pride flags on LGBTQ people. During the press conference, a new Pride flag went up at Roe and Frantz’s home.
“So today, on the 10-year anniversary of the federal legalization of same-sex marriage, we raise a new flag,” Roe said. “Not just in defiance, but in honor of all of those who have suffered because of hate, here in our community and everywhere that hate still exists.”
Police deemed what happened to Roe and Frantz a targeted attack, according to Citizen Action. 
Reiko Ramos, statewide anti-violence program director for the group Diverse & Resilient, which has a program that serves LGBTQ survivors of violence, shared a story at the press conference about a youth seeking the help of someone flying a Pride flag outside his home. 
“Complete strangers, they had never met,” Ramos said. “But they knew that his home was a safe place, that they could knock on their door. They were fleeing from their family, because they were experiencing domestic violence as a result of their identity… This youth actually knocked on the door and said, ‘I don’t know you, but I think you might be someone that I can ask for help.’” 
“And that is how this young person got connected to our services,” Ramos said. 
Mary Bogen, chairperson of the advocacy group Hate Free Outagamie (HFO), went to the press conference at Roe and Frantz’s home. She said she lives down the street.
“There’s a lot of people within this area that have had their Pride flags ripped down or had their houses vandalized for displaying pride flags,” Bogen said.
Bogen said that in some cases, she’s heard from people at Hate Free Outagamie events that they know who is responsible for stealing their Pride flag but don’t feel comfortable reporting it to the police. 
Bogen told the Examiner that  the LGBTQ+ community in Appleton is strong and thriving but that their resilience shouldn’t be necessary to walk down the street. 
“We often face open hostility, whether at a recent vigil we held for victims of the Pulse shooting or simply leaving a Pride event,” Bogen said. “People scream slurs from cars, film us for harassment, and sneer as if bigotry is a civic pastime. And too often, it’s done under the banner of a certain kind of patriotism. This isn’t just incidents, it’s a pattern. We refuse to accept it as normal. Our community deserves safety, respect, and the freedom to exist without fear. That’s why Hate Free Outagamie is working to establish a Trans Sanctuary in Outagamie County.”
In September 2023, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors voted to become a sanctuary for transgender and non-binary people, and Dane County made a similar decision earlier that year, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
Under the Milwaukee resolution, if the state of Wisconsin passes a law “that imposes criminal or civil punishments, fines, or professional sanctions on any person or organization that seeks, provides, receives or helps someone to receive gender-affirming care such as puberty blockers, hormones, or surgery, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors urges the Milwaukee County Sheriff to make enforcement their lowest priority.”
Vered Meltzer, a local alder and reportedly the first openly transgender individual to hold elected office in Wisconsin, said there is “still so much work to be done in Appleton to make things better, but we are the ones who build the world into the community that we want it to be.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal grant cuts to research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center could include funding for programs meant to improve diversity in medical research faculty and research participants, according to data released by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center — a medical system giant in the southeast that handles more than 3.5 million patient visits annually — expects to lay off 650 employees due to grant and funding cuts made by the Trump Administration, the organization announced in a statement on June 20. Staffing cuts will be focused in research, administrative and support roles.
The health care system plans to reduce its operating costs by $300 million “in response to the impact of budgetary actions in Washington, D.C. related to government-sponsored research and patient care,” VUMC stated.
VUMC declined to provide more specific information on the research projects and grants impacted by federal cuts, but DOGE’s database indicates funding retractions for at least two multi-year VUMC initiatives receiving support from the National Institutes of Health.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center to lay off up to 650 after Trump administration grant cuts

The Vanderbilt Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (Vanderbilt FIRST) program aims to recruit more women and people of minority racial or ethnic groups to the faculty. 
“Scientific workforce diversity has been a longstanding challenge, and lack of progress negatively impacts innovation, scientific discovery, and ultimately public health,” the program’s description on federal grant database USASpending.gov states.
NIH allocated nearly $6 million toward the program, but the site shows about $1.4 million had been paid before the grant was scrapped, totaling an estimated $4.6 million loss for VUMC.
Another program aimed to bolster engagement for participants in research, particularly for participants of diverse backgrounds. 
“Our nationwide community of participants and researchers is partnering together to ensure that everyone is included in research,” the “All of Us” research program’s page on the NIH website states. “The information our participants generously share is fueling thousands of studies to better understand health and disease and enable more tailored and equitable approaches to care.”
Roughly $2.8 million was obligated for the latest “All of Us” initiative, and USASpending.gov shows about $2 million has been funnelled by the government, adding up to an $800,000 loss for VUMC.
While the DOGE database indicates the types of programs targeted for funding cuts by the Trump Administration, it does not present a complete picture of all funding cuts to an organization. The database may not be regularly updated to reflect the reinstatement of funds. Its data is also imperfect. A previous analysis by Tennessee Lookout found that while DOGE listed only one terminated grant worth $305,000 for Middle Tennessee State University, that grant was really one of several canceled grants with federal funding roots at the university. 
DOGE’s records show another unidentified grant for VUMC initially worth $27.4 million was terminated with $4.4 million left unpaid.
The staying power of NIH grant cuts is unclear. A federal judge ruled in a multi-state court case earlier this month that the Trump Administration must reinstate some grants after declaring their termination was “void and illegal.” The ruling’s order to restore grant funding applied only to grants mentioned in that lawsuit and another similar suit filed by the American Public Health Association.
VUMC is not listed as a party in either lawsuit.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)About 85,000 acres of backcountry in Tennessee could be opened for road construction, mining and logging under a Trump administration plan to remove protections from the most remote and untouched portions of U.S. national forests.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins last week announced the plan to rescind the “roadless rule,” which has preserved 59 million acres of public forests and grasslands across the nation since the Clinton administration adopted it in 2001, following decades of advocacy by conservation groups.
Rollins said the move is necessary to allow for wildfire management, create opportunities for the timber industry and reflects President Donald Trump’s mandate to ax “overcomplicated, burdensome barriers that hamper American business and innovation.”
Environmental groups say eliminating the rule puts wildlife, clean water, recreation and old-growth forests “on the chopping block” and clears the way for mining, oil and gas development and timber harvesting.
The announcement “shows this administration is completely out of touch with what Americans value in our public lands,” said Sam Evans, who leads the Southern Environmental Law Center’s National Forests and Parks Program. 
The roadless rule contains specific exceptions for wildfire prevention and suppression, and for removal of non-native species.
“Saying this is about wildfire protection is not even a good fig leaf,” he said.

Of Tennessee’s 698,000 acres of national forested lands, 85,000 have protections under the current roadless rule. 
They include portions of Land Between the Lakes in northern Tennessee and pockets within the Cherokee National Forest that stretches for 660,000 acres across the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Beaver Dam Creek, Slide Hollow, Elk Creek, Bald Mountains, Horse Cove, Sycamore Creek are among the popular backcountry areas currently protected by the roadless rule.
U.S. Department of Agriculture officials did not respond to questions about the proposed rule but noted on its web site that “more information will be released as the rescission process gets underway.”
The process to eliminate a federal rule requires preparation of environmental analyses, compliance with the Endangered Species Act, tribal consultation and coordination with affected states in a public rule-making process, it said.

(Getty Images)Fertility treatment advocates have expressed concerns about a new Arkansas law they say is meant to cast doubt on the effectiveness of assisted reproductive technology, even though the law does not penalize or prohibit such treatments.
Act 859 of 2025, the Reproductive Empowerment and Support Through Optimal Restoration (RESTORE) Act, is “groundbreaking legislation that champions reproductive healthcare for women in Arkansas by prioritizing restorative reproductive medicine,” the conservative group Heritage Action for America said in an April news release.
The law defines “restorative reproductive medicine” as “a scientific approach… that seeks to cooperate with or restore the normal physiology and anatomy of the human reproductive system without the use of methods that are inherently suppressive, circumventive or destructive to natural human functions.”
Restorative reproductive medicine includes ultrasounds, blood tests, hormone measurements, exploratory surgeries, “natural procreative technology” and “fertility awareness-based methods,” among other things, according to Act 859.
The law goes into effect in August and requires Arkansas insurance companies to cover restorative reproductive medicine. This includes the Medicaid expansion program, Elizabeth Pitman, director of the Division of Medical Services for Arkansas Medicaid, told the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee in March.
  Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs (Arkansas Secretary of State)
The RESTORE Act’s sponsor, Heber Springs Republican Rep. Alyssa Brown, said at the same committee meeting that restorative reproductive medicine is not only more affordable than assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) but also is “less abrasive on the body and has higher success rates.”
“I want to be clear: This doesn’t limit anyone’s ability to access IVF,” said Brown, who did not respond to the Advocate’s requests for comment.
Brown’s statement was true, but Act 859 is still cause for concern, said Dr. Dean Moutos, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Little Rock’s Arkansas Fertility and Gynecology Associates. The clinic’s website includes a header that warns prospective patients against restorative reproductive medicine, saying it’s “not a medically proven alternative to IVF.”
“If you read between the lines, [Act 859] is a backhanded attack on assisted reproductive technology in my view, not because of what they say, but because of what they clearly omit” by not including proven methods such as IVF in discussions of fertility treatments, Moutos said in an interview.

He disputed the claim that assisted reproductive technologies are “suppressive” as supporters of restorative reproductive medicine claim.
“When they talk about natural procreation, restoring nature and all this other stuff, that’s great, but the patients I’ve seen have already tried that and it hasn’t worked,” Moutos said.
Similarly, the IVF advocacy group Resolve: The National Infertility Association is concerned that the rhetoric surrounding restorative reproductive medicine frames it as a necessary “first step before IVF,” and this could “take some of the autonomy from the patient,” Resolve Director of Government Affairs Alise Powell said in an interview.
“It’s concerning that folks are trying to deprioritize something that is evidence-based in favor of something that… folks are already doing in order to prepare themselves on their fertility journey,” Powell said.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which advocates for physicians that practice reproductive health care and fertility treatments, said restorative reproductive medicine “is not medical practice but ideology.”
“Its proponents create a false narrative that standard fertility care skips proper diagnosis or healing, when in fact, it is based on precisely those principles,” the organization stated.
Moutos said he was not surprised that assisted reproductive technology has come under conservative scrutiny in the three years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left abortion access up to the states. Arkansas has one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion bans, with a narrow exception to save the life of the pregnant individual.
IVF providers in Alabama, which also has one of the most restrictive abortion bans, temporarily halted operations in response to a February 2024 state Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children and if destroyed, a wrongful death lawsuit could be filed. State lawmakers later passed legislation providing criminal and civil protections for IVF clinics.
Republican President Donald Trump, who called himself the “father of IVF” on the campaign trail last year, issued an executive order earlier this year directing policy advisers to create a report on how to make in vitro fertilization more accessible for Americans.

What top IVF advocates want from the White House fertility care plan


 ‘Natural’ methods

Restorative reproductive medicine is “not mainstream medicine,” which merits the warning against it on the Arkansas Fertility and Gynecology website, Moutos said, but none of his patients have asked him about it because it lacks “traction with the general public.”
In addition to the insurance coverage requirement for restorative reproductive medicine, Act 859 also prohibits state-funded entities from penalizing a medical professional who declines to participate in fertility treatments due to “sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.”
Some branches of conservative Christian ideology disagree with assisted reproductive technology and condone only “natural” methods of conception.
Act 859 frequently mentions “fertility awareness-based methods,” such as tracking body temperature and hormone production during the menstrual cycle, as methods of assessing fertility without medical intervention. The law specifically cites the Billings Ovulation Method of fertility tracking, endorsed by the Catholic Church, which opposes artificial contraception. The law also cites the Creighton Model FertilityCare System, marketed as a “standardized modification” of the Billings method.
Moutos said these methods are not part of standard fertility treatment practices because they are “too unreliable” and have “a pretty high failure rate.”
The RESTORE Act requires the use of fertility awareness-based methods in programs funded by federal Title X family planning grant funds, which the Trump administration has attempted to withhold.

An earlier version of the RESTORE Act, which Brown amended in March, would have required the Department of Health to “implement reporting requirements for the standard of care for the diagnosis of infertility,” including “referrals to restorative reproductive medicine that are given before referrals for or use of assisted reproductive technology.”
Rep. Denise Ennett, D-Little Rock, said at the March committee meeting that she had issues with this portion of the bill because it could lead to privacy violations and discrimination via “the surveillance of tracking women’s personal health data.”
Brown told Ennett the intent of the deleted language was to “figure out how to update these services to better serve women who want to conceive.”
 Other legislation

A 2023 bill sponsored by Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, would have charged abortion recipients with homicide and repealed sections of Arkansas law that protect IVF providers from prosecution if an embryo is damaged or discarded. The bill was never heard in committee.
Two other bills related to fertility treatments that Brown sponsored during the 2025 legislative session caught Moutos’ attention, he said, but neither made it out of committee.
The proposed Fertility Clinic Licensure Act would have created a special license for medical clinics that practice IVF in addition to their existing medical licenses.
The proposed Assisted Reproductive Technology Reporting Act would have required fertility clinics to annually report to the state Department of Health how many embryos they fertilize and the outcomes of each one, ranging from discarding to full-term pregnancies.
Fertility clinics are already required to report this data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Moutos said.
Rep. Dolly Henley, R-Washington, said she was strongly opposed to the Assisted Reproductive Technology Reporting Act. She voted against the RESTORE Act in the House Public Health committee in March because she mistakenly thought it was the other bill. Henley later realized her mistake and voted for the RESTORE Act when it passed the full House, she said in an interview.
Arkansas health care workers support national call to protect IVF

The law passed the House with the support of three Democrats — Reps. Glenn Barnes of Pine Bluff, and Joy Springer and Fred Allen of Little Rock — and 76 Republicans. It passed the Senate along party lines with all six Democrats voting against it.
Republican U.S. senators introduced the RESTORE Act on the federal level in May after the same bill did not advance in Congress last year. Conversely, Senate Democrats introduced legislation this year and last year to protect access to IVF.
A Democrat-sponsored bill to require Arkansas’ State and Public School Life and Health Insurance Program to cover IVF did not advance in the Legislature this year.

“Hold on, wait a minute, let me put some freedom in it!” about 50 kids chanted, while their parents held up their phones to record the moment. 
The Friday-morning event commemorated the end of Freedom School this summer — a free weeks-long program that promotes reading and leadership skills. The Children’s Defense Fund runs the program in 26 states every year, with more than 11,000 student participants, but Freedom Schools have especially deep roots in Mississippi.
As part of the 1964 Freedom Summer civil rights project, the first Freedom Schools aimed at fostering political and community engagement were founded in Mississippi. Three decades later, the Children’s Defense Fund revived the concept, opening their first schools in 1995. 
What exists now at Jackson Public Schools, the only district in Mississippi that has partnered with CDF since 2022 to operate Freedom Schools at three of their sites, is a “reimagined” version of what existed the summer of 1964. 
“It’s so important, when you think about what the teachers were able to accomplish that one summer,” said Kristal Moore Clemons, national director of the Freedom Schools program. “To have this rebirth and have children in 2025 learn about civil rights and the importance of being change agents and leaders, it’s just remarkable.”
For five days a week this past month, from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m., the students were led through a literacy curriculum, learned about history and practiced leadership skills. They read one book a week, and at the end of the program, they got to take a book home to build their own personal library. 
It doesn’t matter what reading level the students are at when they arrive — CDF trains college-age “servant leader interns” to meet the kids where they are and bolster their skills. 
Janai Virgil, an upcoming 4th grader at McWillie Elementary School, has been attending the summer program for two years now. Her mother, Jamila, spent a lot of time researching Freedom Schools to decide whether or not she wanted her daughter to attend. The focus on civic engagement made up her mind. 
“The students improve their reading skills over the summer, but they also learn about our history and their role in society,” she said. “This program helps them think about how they fit into the greater picture and how they can help not only themselves but their families and their local community, state and country, and that when we work together collectively we can achieve great things.”
Every June afternoon Jamila picked Janai up from Freedom School, the 9-year-old could barely contain her excitement telling her mother everything she’d learned, all the books she’d read and the rich conversations she’d had. 
“I can tell it’s affecting her and her desire to improve her community,” Jamila said. 
Additionally, Clemons said the program is greatly successful at preventing the dreaded “summer slide” — the loss of academic knowledge over summer vacation. And in Jackson, retaining reading skills is more important than ever.
The state’s reading gains have garnered national attention, but just over half of third-graders at Jackson Public Schools are reading on grade level. 
JPS board member Jeanne Middleton-Hairston was one of the proud adults in the crowd on Friday. As she watched on, the significance of the program resonated with her. 
Middleton-Hairston grew up in west Jackson. Her grandmother lived across the street from civil rights workers who came down the summer of 1964, and Medgar Evers’ office was two blocks away from her childhood home. 
“The history of Freedom Schools is part of the soil here,” she said. “It’s a safe place for them to come and know how brilliant and able they are and how working together makes everything better for everyone. There ain’t no school like Freedom School.”
So when the students started singing, Middleton-Hairston couldn’t help but get up and dance.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/27142216/IMG_5953.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

The influence wielded by wealthy individuals and corporations over tax policy often leads to systems that favour the upper class, further exacerbating income inequality and placing a greater burden on the middle and lower classes.”- Dr. Farh Naz (March 2025)
I am a capitalist. I retired as a senior vice president with a national health care corporation. One of my clients was the Charleston Area Medical Center. 
But I know Dr. Naz is correct. Most Americans know little of our own history, and do not realize how wealthy special interests have historically controlled our lives. Here is one West Virginia example.
My best friend was a coal miner on the West Virginia/Pennsylvania border. But when asked, he knew nothing about the 1921 Blair Mountain uprising. I doubt many West Virginians do, especially younger ones. 
Given the rightward political turn of West Virginians over the past few decades, it’s important that they know this anti-capitalist aspect of their history. A good place to start is a West Virginia Archives and History publication named “The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920-1921” by Clayton D. Laurie.
A century ago, coal mine owners treated their underpaid and mistreated miners as virtual indentured servants. West Virginia’s politicians were in the pockets of mine operators, as were local officials. They did nothing to alleviate the suffering of commoners. The response of the powerless, exploited miners was to form unions, culminating in the 1890 formation of the United Mine Workers. 
Mine owners viciously opposed unionization, using “eviction, termination, blacklisting, yellow dog contracts, court injunctions, coercion and intimidation.” Still, unions were able to obtain limited power. By 1920, the UMW had grown to 50,000 members. 
This situation came to a violent head in what was known as the “Matewan Massacre.” The Matewan Massacre was a shootout between locals (including the sheriff), and outside private mercenaries (so called “detectives”) paid by the mine owners. Many people died, including Matewan’s mayor. 
Federal troops were brought in at the request of the governor (as opposed to Trump’s recent unilateral nationalization of the California National Guard against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom). They quashed the miners wanting unionization and imposed martial law. 
The situation worsened over time, eventually resulting in the Battle of Blair Mountain. At Blair Mountain, 7,000 poorly armed miners wanting to unionize Logan County mines stood up to an army consisting of private mercenaries, the West Virginia National Guard, and Federal troops.
The miners were outgunned. After a five-day pitched battle, they lost, leading to a deterioration of the union. The UMW did not get back to its prior strength until the New Deal in 1933. 
During my decades in corporate America, I learned that corporations, like the West Virginia mine owners, have only one goal — profit. And the aim of corporate executives is to maximize their power, leading to the creation of personal wealth. These objectives lead to efficient operations in most cases (although not always). However, they increasingly lead to worker exploitation, as was historically true in West Virginia’s mines. 
Per a Pew Research report, our nation has tremendous inequities versus G-7 nations. This wealth gap is getting larger, doubling from 1989 to 2016. But there is a failure by the GOP base, which supported tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations in 2017, to understand why. And that base still supports Trump’s extending these cuts now via his “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The average West Virginian would be better off with a blend of capitalism infused with socialism, like in Europe. We have some welfare programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. Of course, no one acknowledges them as socialistic, which they are. 
They have become the third rail of American politics. And are with us for good, as Trump knows. But America must do more, including lowering the age for Medicare benefits, eliminating the 20% co-pay and eventually having Medicare for all Americans which would reduce current program waste and overhead. 
Regarding revenue generation, America can also do much more. For example, taxing all income for Social Security, rather than cutting off at $176,000 in 2025. And raising taxes on the rich and corporations, rather than extending Trump’s cuts. All it takes is the political will.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Speaking before the Kentucky Public Service Commission, Big Rivers Electric Corp. CEO Don Gulley recently praised the economic impact of the Nucor steel mill that began operating in late 2022 near the Meade County seat of Brandenburg. 
The Nucor Corp. says it employs more than 400 people to make steel plates for heavy equipment and infrastructure, including foundations for off-shore wind towers. Local elected officials in Meade County along with Gov. Andy Beshear have also hailed the project. 
“This was a massive effort to locate a large manufacturing company in Kentucky that would bring jobs, would bring secondary impact, would bring tax benefits and would be just generally good for the state,” Gulley said during a June 4 hearing. 
Now, much to Big Rivers’ dismay, an aspect of that deal is under scrutiny by the state’s utility regulator.
Big Rivers granted Nucor a significant discount on its large electricity bill in the form of millions of dollars of fuel costs that the steel mill didn’t have to pay. Those electricity costs, estimated by Gulley to be about $11 million a year, were instead passed on to Big Rivers’ approximately 121,000 ratepayers through 2031, under a contract between the utility and the company. The vast majority of Big Rivers’ ratepayers are residences and businesses. 
It’s unclear why a discount that’s been in place for several years has drawn the attention of the Public Service Commission (PSC) in recent months, but the scrutiny has spurred Big Rivers’ leaders and the three electricity distribution cooperatives that the utility supplies to warn the PSC against trying to change the contract.

(gray) and Meade County Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. (blue). The utility has its headquarters in Owensboro. (Source: Big Rivers Electric Corp.)
Gulley used the term “nuclear option” to describe the possibility that the PSC would order Big Rivers to refund to ratepayers the millions of dollars in fuel costs they covered for the steel mill.
Gulley said such a decision could force the nonprofit utility to seek an emergency rate increase  and impact the utility’s ability to meet its loan obligations. 
He said an emergency rate case “would be highly detrimental” and could have a significant “negative impact” on the utility’s credit rating and future costs to take out loans. 
It’s also not clear if ratepayers knew about the arrangement between Big Rivers and Nucor that had them covering a significant portion of the steel mill’s electricity costs. In a response to questions from the Lantern including if ratepayers were aware of the arrangement, a Big Rivers spokesperson said the utility couldn’t share much about the ongoing case. 
“We are very supportive of the unique Nucor development, which has provided numerous benefits to Big Rivers and its Member-Owners, as well as to the region and state,” Gulley said in a statement provided through the spokesperson. 
Questions over fuel costs
The contract between Big Rivers and the Nucor steel mill in Brandenburg became a point of contention in recent months as the commission reviewed Big Rivers’ fuel adjustment clause, a provision that allows utilities to automatically pass through to ratepayers the changing costs of fuel, typically coal or natural gas in Kentucky.
The PSC regularly reviews utilities’ use of the fuel adjustment clause to make sure only reasonable costs are being passed on to ratepayers. The PSC can order a refund to ratepayers if it determines a utility has overcharged for fuel.
Big Rivers’ contract with Nucor exempted the industrial operation from paying its share of the variable fuel costs through the fuel adjustment clause.Those fuel adjustment clause costs were collected from other ratepayers instead, raising their fuel costs and utility bills.
Gulley, along with leaders of electricity distribution cooperatives Jackson Purchase Energy Cooperative, Meade County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation and Kenergy Corp., argued to regulators the higher fuel charges for other ratepayers were well worth it because of the economic benefits that the Nucor steel mill in Brandenburg had provided. 
The utility in a filing says the PSC approved the contract  including what the utility says are provisions that the commission is now questioning — with Nucor in 2020 — even if the utility received no PSC guidance or directive specifically allowing it to exempt Nucor from paying for variable fuel costs.
  Don Gulley, Big Rivers Electric Corp. CEO and president, urged the Public Service Commission not to require the utility to credit ratepayers for Nucor’s past fuel costs. (Screenshot/YouTube)
The utility argued the provisions in the contract were “necessary” to land Nucor in Meade County. 
“Undoubtedly, it has been a win,” Gulley said. “I’m not sure it was everything that was promised, but I also recognize that Nucor is an international company and operates on a global basis.” 
This question of ratepayers covering the cost of a large industrial customer’s discount arises at a time when power-intensive data centers are looking to negotiate electricity deals with utilities. 
“If utilities are going to be negotiating one-off special contracts with new large (electricity) loads, it certainly has the possibility of things like this being missed and socialized over to the bills of all the other ratepayers in Kentucky,” said Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council. 
Gary, whose group intervenes in utility regulation cases before the PSC, wasn’t involved in the Big Rivers case focusing on Nucor’s contract but did review the filings in the case before the PSC. 
But in an interview with the Lantern, Gary questioned whether the economic development arguments justify requiring other ratepayers to bear Nucor’s variable fuel costs, though he declined to offer an opinion on whether the arrangement was appropriate.
He also said the arrangement between Nucor and Big Rivers could potentially violate PSC precedent that requires companies subject to economic development electricity agreements to cover variable costs. 
Nucor contract has helped stabilize Big Rivers’ finances
Big Rivers has asked the PSC, which traditionally speaks through its written orders, for a decision. The utility also has suggested options the PSC could take that would allow the utility to maintain its arrangement, including offering ratepayers a report on the costs of fuel costs for the Nucor steel mill. 
During the June 4 hearing, Gulley said having Nucor as a customer has strengthened the utility’s recently shaky financial position. Big Rivers had to raise rates after aluminum smelters stopped purchasing power from the utility. Consumer advocates have previously raised concerns about significant increases  in utility bills and electricity costs for Big Rivers’ ratepayers in the past 15 years. 
“I have worked to change the focus at Big Rivers to serve our members and to be member focused. I’ve made great progress in the last 18 months,” said Gulley, who was hired as the utility’s president and CEO in 2023. “This is a pivotal moment for us, and we’ll chart the course for the next three to five years.”

(Courtesy photo from the Rhode Island Airport Corporation)The New England Patriots will keep parking their Boeing 767 planes at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport for another five years under a deal that keeps the Warwick hub as the team’s official airport.
And all it will cost the team is one dollar — along with a lot of courtesy advertising to boost the airport’s regional branding. 
That’s according to the agreement approved by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation this month which waives landing and parking fees for the team’s two jumbo jets at T.F. Green through July 2030. In exchange, the Patriots will continue to provide the Warwick airport with a series of promotional benefits including permission to use the team’s name and image in ads in every New England state, aside from Vermont.
The six-time Super Bowl champs must also provide T.F. Green signage along the endzone at each home game at Gillette Stadium, along with digital ads on the team’s website, mobile applications, and social media; and Patriot game radio spots.
T.F. Green has been the official airport of the Patriots since the two signed a similar deal in 2017.
“This agreement benefits both parties and allows us to advertise within our catchment area in a meaningful and cost-effective way that has helped us increase passenger volume,” Iftikhar Ahmad, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, said in a statement.
A Patriots spokesperson declined to comment on the renewed deal.
New ads are still in development by the Denver-based agency Karsh Hagan, according to Nikolas Persson, RIAC’s senior vice president of business development and information technology.
No firm numbers are listed in the new contract with the Patriots, aside from the estimated five million impressions that digital ads will likely provide the airport each football season. 
Charts provided to Rhode Island Current show airport officials waived nearly $527,000 worth of fees between 2020 and 2024 while the Patriots provided a little over $6.1 million worth of ads in that same period.
Whatever airport officials get out of the new deal, University of Rhode Island marketing professor Dan Sheinin sees the continued partnership with the Patriots as a way for T.F. Green to to set itself apart from regional competitors like Logan International Airport in Boston or Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.
“For Green, the component is to stay in the mental conversation,” he said. “I’m sure everybody knows it’s there — but if people don’t have any experience with the airport or haven’t been there for a long time, they probably don’t think about it.”
And there’s no bigger brand to boost that name recognition with than the National Football League.
“The NFL is one of the hottest culture and entertainment brands that exists,” Sheinin said. “Any brand or entity that’s affiliated with any aspect of the shield is going to get some sort of halo benefits from that — even if it’s a team that’s in the lower half of the league.”
It hasn’t been a good few years for the Patriots. The team is coming off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and has had two coaching changes. But the deal makers were apparently optimistic that the team can return to its winning ways, as the contract includes provisions for branding around postseason games.
“If the Patriots get back to being competitive, this kind of association will be even more valuable,” Sheinin said.

NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.











I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert



The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.











We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


–  – Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey



Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Getty Images)Our weekly newspaper — The Anderson News — is published on Thursdays. 
On Friday, June 20, I stopped at the Lawrenceburg Kroger to grab a copy of the paper, but the stack of issues was dated June 12, the week prior. I recalled being at our Walmart a few weeks earlier, on a Monday, and that The Anderson News from the previous week had still not been delivered. 
When I asked a busy clerk about this, she shrugged. “It comes when it comes.”
You might say I should get with the program and read my local newspaper online, but like many Kentuckians I live out a rural road and down a hill where the internet and even phone service can be spotty, so as long as The Anderson News is available in paper form, I choose paper. This is also how I track what little news is in our newspaper these days, and I am coming to the sad realization that we are witnessing the slow, suffocating, untimely death of our once-robust community newspaper.
There is a fairly famous essay titled “Drowning doesn’t look like drowning” by Mario Vittone that gets reprinted by a number of news outlets every summer. Vittone lists a handful of unexpected things to look for and stipulates that “Drowning is almost always a deceptively quiet event. The waving, splashing, and yelling that dramatic conditioning (television) prepares us to look for, is rarely seen in real life.”
Similarly, the death of local news can be deceptively quiet. No big boss in a three-piece suit comes to town, hands out pink slips, and shuts down a printing press with a loud hiss. 
Here in Anderson County, Kentucky, population 24,000, there still exists a newspaper; there is a pop-up-ad-heavy website that’s updated weekly; there are still paper-papers, albeit sometimes delivered late, in neat, familiar stacks near the front doors of Kroger, Walmart and the gas station where you can see what is above the fold; there are still obituaries and high school sports and a report that a county or city meeting occurred. 
But there is no context, historical or otherwise, no investigations to speak of, and no — how do I say this? — life.
As a freelancer, I regularly wrote commentary for The Anderson News from 2017-2020. Back then there was an office, an experienced and dedicated editor, a front desk clerk, and at least one reporter and/or sports reporter on staff. To say we had an engaging opinion page or letters the the editor page (sometimes two full pages) is an understatement. Our newspaper was our town square, so much so that I would often grab coffee and a paper at the Five Star gas station first thing on the morning the paper came out and drive to a friend’s office before 9 a.m. to banter about what was happening in town.
In May 2021, Paxton Media Group announced that it had purchased The Anderson News and dozens of other community newspapers. “We are very excited to add these newspapers into the PMG portfolio,” said Jamie Paxton, PMG president and CEO. “PMG believes strongly in the value of local newspapers and the vital role they play in the communities that they serve.”
Vital role? The Anderson News is an anemic shell of itself at, most weeks, eight pages. 
The opinion page and letters to the editor no longer exist, signaling lack of community input and engagement. 
Reports on city and county meetings are rote, reading more like meeting minutes than reportage or analysis. Investigations, in-depth interviews and follow up are non-existent.
There is a full page dedicated to religion, and politicians like state representative James Tipton, state senator Aaron Reed, and U.S. Rep. Andy Barr are often given half or almost-full pages to communicate their political agendas to the public.
Multiple datelines in our June 12 paper, for example, read BARDSTOWN, LOUISVILLE, LEXINGTON. In other words, not here.

It is often said that newspapers don’t make money, so what can we expect? What about capitalism? Here I will argue that newspapers, like the government, do not exist to make money. Newspapers and government agencies exist (or *should* exist) to serve the people. When newspapers and/or government entities are tasked to focus on profit profit profit, like a business with shareholders, citizens’ needs become collateral damage.
Case in point: Billionaire Elon Musk was tasked by the current president to rid government agencies of waste, fraud and abuse via his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But for all the hoopla, Reuters reports, ”DOGE is not a serious exercise,” said Jessica Riedl, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank that supports streamlining government. She estimates DOGE has only saved $5 billion to date, and believes it will end up costing more than it saves.”
On the newspaper side, what we have learned in Anderson County is that when your local newspaper is starved of the resources to report enough news to keep citizens informed in a timely manner, beware of what will fill the void. 
Enter the “Lawrenceburg Catch All.” 
According to their Facebook page, Lawrenceburg Catch All was created two years after Paxton Media Group purchased The Anderson News. There are three administrators, more than 9,000 members who can post anonymously if they choose to, and there appears to be no checking of sources or facts. During recent breaking news in which almost our entire city fire department resigned, citizens found what they wanted to know — true or not — in the Lawrenceburg Catch All and in Lexington TV news, not our newspaper.
Last week I asked locals to describe the Lawrenceburg Catch All in one word. This is what they told me: drama, embarrassing, breaking news, meanness, a soap opera, ugly, funny, trouble, misinformation, s**t, a train wreck. And yet they all still check this page as their news source because, as one man said, “Where else am I supposed to look?”
Drowning doesn’t look like drowning, and living in a news desert does not mean your newspaper was shuttered with fanfare like they do in the movies.
One day you find out that your newspaper has been purchased by a corporate consolidator like Paxton Media Group who claims to care about journalism and your community. 
Then you learn that your newspaper’s longtime editor has been replaced by a preacher-turned-editor who soon goes back to being a preacher. They tell you everything is fine because yet another editor, who is in a different county and in charge of multiple newspapers, is now the editor, and that your town has one reporter who lives somewhere else.
Months later, you are driving through town when you notice your newspaper’s office has been quietly closed and that “The Anderson News” sign you used to drive by every day, near the Dairy Queen, has been removed from the marquee. 
One day in the very near future, you, too, may live in a town where local news is just a private Facebook group moderated by people you don’t know and where group members who can post anonymously are the sources.
This is the definition of a news desert.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In 1996, women from both sides of the strife tearing apart Northern Ireland, then divided along ethno-nationalist lines, formed a political party to advocate for inclusion and human rights in upcoming peace talks. Only the top 10 vote-getting parties would be part of the talks. Though they organized only six weeks in advance of the election, the women’s party came in ninth out of 24. 
Their remarkable success was attributed to keeping their message simple: inclusion, human rights and equality. They also urged “transversal politics,” meaning members could keep their own identity and views on various issues while respecting those of others to advance their common goal of having a voice at the table. Their slogan was “Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs.” 
The No Kings movement could learn from those Irish women.
I consider myself part of the No Kings movement. I call it a movement because movements are collective efforts by a group of people to bring about or resist social or political change.
There were eight marches to protest the values and policies of the Trump Administration in my small state of Rhode Island on June 14, which just so happened to be Flag Day.
That day, tens of thousands of people showed up for marches in New York, New Jersey and Southern California. Estimates overall suggest millions of people participated in marches across the United States. Photos of the demonstrations show some marchers waved U.S. flags, but the flags of other nations appeared as well.
Consequently, the simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.
As a female academic teaching security studies in professional military education for 20-plus years, the importance of “reading the room” and consequently properly “selling your message” to the audience cannot be overstated. What will make them listen? What will shut them down? The same is true for the growing numbers of Trump supporters who are disappointed — and frightened by — the actions of an increasingly authoritarian regime. Latino voters who helped Trump retake the White House, for example, are falling away, as are low-information voters, rural voters, young adults and ethnic voters. But they will not be lured to a movement that often conveys mixed messages through its rhetoric and images. The message ought to be of a tolerant, diverse, united America. But that’s not always the case. 










The simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.


The Fourth of July is the perfect opportunity to do better.
Rather than showing up at rallies and parades with flags from other countries and symbols of political causes, No Kings supporters should show up with American flags. Diversity makes America great, and a sea of diverse individuals all waving the same flag shows a united front. All Americans are Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, and all Americans are Mexican on Cinco de Mayo. Now all Americans and those who want to live in an American democracy need to show their support for American democracy when trying to stop an autocracy. “Make America Great Again” Trumpians have usurped the America flag as their own but abandoned American values. The No Kings movement needs to embrace and retake the American flag as its own, as a symbol of American democracy and values. 
Further, rather than glorifying individuals who have been unjustly attacked after they exercised their constitutional rights to, for example, free speech — some of whom are themselves divisive for their political views — simply support the right to free speech, as well as freedoms like religion and assembly. Don’t give Trumpians the opportunity to distort the important message of the No Kings movement into one of a hyper-radicalized left where individuals can’t even get along with each other. For the movement to grow, it must attract diverse individuals who can tip the scales away from authoritarianism. It must give all individuals a safe and welcoming place to go.
And while many individuals are rightly afraid of their rights being abused by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or some other form of retribution, individuals can be identified with or without a mask if the government is determined to do so. Pictures of individuals who show up at rallies or parades wearing masks and waving flags from other countries quickly become headline news or click bait for right-wing media. That does not serve the movement well.
We are living in an era of normalized chaos, deliberately created to allow autocracy to take hold. The No Kings movement clearly shows there is opposition. Movements can learn from the success and failure of others. No Kings should take an organizational and marketing lesson from the women of Northern Ireland.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Kings-SLC_SH_02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 06:02:16.336995

US Senate launches debate on GOP mega-bill, but passage still not assured

Provider assessment rates and state-directed payment programs are at risk — two funding mechanisms that are critical to hospital operation in Virginia and that determine how hospitals chip into the state’s expanded Medicaid coverage. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association estimated each program could take a $2 billion hit, if the proposal is fully implemented. 
The measure ignited fresh controversy in recent days, as hospitals warned against adjusting the assessment rates from 6% to 3.5%. Over the weekend, members of U.S. Senate began floor debate on the bill, which key Republican senators like Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, had said they would not vote to advance because of the assessments adjustment proposal and the damage it could do to rural hospitals in their states.
Late Saturday, Hawley and all but two other GOP senators voted to advance a new version of the bill that included a $25 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 to 2032. Critics, however, still caution that fund will not fill the financial gaps as states lose portions of federal funding through the Medicaid cuts.
In a call with reporters on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia said he doesn’t plan to vote for the bill as it stands. The week prior his Senate colleague, Democrat Tim Kaine said the same. As the bill proceeds to what is called a vote-a-rama, Senate Democrats have remained in opposition to the bill.
The possible Medicaid changes are part of an overall budget package that President Donald Trump dubbed the “one big beautiful bill” and has pressured Congress to send to his desk by July 4.  While there is still more time for deliberations before the Senate votes whether to send the bill to Trump and he potentially signs the Medicaid changes into law, hospital associations warned in their letter that if he does, vulnerable, already-cash-strapped hospitals would struggle to keep their doors open or need to cut the services they offer.
“Stable funding is vital not only for serving Medicaid beneficiaries but also for providing care to all patients, including the uninsured, those with commercial insurance, and our seniors and disabled patients on Medicare,” the associations wrote, representing hospitals in North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. “Severe cuts to Medicaid inevitably would lead to cuts in healthcare services for all Americans.”
The hospital funding mechanisms aren’t the only Medicaid changes that Congress is considering.
A version of the bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives includes work requirements to access Medicaid. Though most Medicaid recipients do work, some use Medicaid while they are unable to work due to disabilities or illness. Such is the case for Richmond-area resident Aida Pacheco’s daughter who is out of work while she battles cancer.

Still, the twice-a-year-proof of employment required by that version of the bill could make it challenging for eligible people to stay on Medicaid and overwhelm some government employees with additional work, Warner said. 
He referred to the bill as “budget gimmickery” riddled with “poison pills,” from Medicaid changes to cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits — which could place additional cost burdens on local and state governments. Twenty-three governors have sent a letter to Congress on that matter recently, which Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin didn’t sign. 
Meanwhile, some of Virginia’s federal lawmakers would like to see the president sign the House version of the bill.
Last week Virginia’s 1st District congressman Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, joined a letter in opposition to the Senate draft that reiterated support for the House version of the bill.

“The House’s approach reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard, and we urge that it be retained in the final bill,” they wrote. “Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers.”
After the House’s version of the bill passed by a single vote, Democrats blasted Wittman for his support of it, which could affect about 250,000 Virginians. Wittman asserts eligible Medicaid recipients will not lose coverage and has noted his personal connection to the program. Medicaid coverage allowed his birth mother to continue her pregnancy and his parents to eventually adopt him, he said.
“I know firsthand what access to care means for families like mine,” Wittman said in a recent statement.
 Back to the drawing board?

Amid all the pushback to the Medicaid tweaks in the bill, the Senate’s parliamentarian set Republican’s plans back in a Thursday ruling that found several measures didn’t comply with the federal reconciliation process. Lawmakers then spent the weekend reworking the bill. Though Republicans didn’t back down on their sought changes to the hospital provider taxes in Medicaid, they agreed for the cuts to be delayed and incremental. 
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

As an adviser to the chamber, Thune has said lawmakers won’t challenge the parliamentarian’s ruling, which included other reforms they’ve sought, like reducing federal funds to states that use their own tax dollars to provide Medicaid coverage to immigrants and a bar on patients tapping into Medicaid for gender-affirming care.
Thune told Politico late last week that Republicans may not get “everything that we want” on the provider tax, but that he hopes his party can salvage “most of the reforms.”
Warner said he hopes Republican congresspeople will be “willing to go back to the drawing board and actually work with both parties.”
For now, he thinks it will be “a bumpy next couple of days, but this is a bad bill for America. It’s a bad bill for Virginia.”

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) The U.S. The Department of Agriculture is about to undo the 2001 Roadless Rule that has protected 59 million acres of national forests from being developed or logged for decades. Virginia boasts the most inventoried roadless areas in the southeast, 394,000 acres, which would be opened up for development once the rule is axed. The state has over 1.6 million acres of forest in the National Forest System.
The USDA reports that 30% of the National Forest System lands are restricted from road development through this rule. The Trump Administration has framed this as an impediment to the land being managed for fire risk and said it is hindering economic development in rural America.
“Once again, President Trump is removing absurd obstacles to common sense management of our natural resources by rescinding the overly restrictive roadless rule,” said USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins in a meeting of the Western Governors’ Association. “This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation’s forests. It is abundantly clear that properly managing our forests preserves them from devastating fires and allows future generations of Americans to enjoy and reap the benefits of this great land.”
The rule was created as a way to maintain some of the least-developed parts of the nation to protect wildlife, clean water, recreation and old-growth forests. The rule has been contested in the courts many times as states sought to utilize the lands but has been upheld in most cases.
As for the agency’s concerns over wildfires, the rule already has exemptions to manage fuel reduction through thinning of trees, prescribed burns, creating fuel breaks and removing brush. However, logging groups feel it’s not sufficient to address the dangers the forests face from wildfires.
“With those limited exceptions it hasn’t been enough to effectively manage the forest and reduce wildfire hazards and the disease infestation of bugs,” said Scott Dane, Executive Director of the American Loggers Council.
Dane said that limiting access to these lands has, in a way, contributed to shutting down logging across the country with the collapse of the mill infrastructure. From the logging perspective, he said the Roadless Rule was an anti-logging industry policy and stepped away from proper management of the national forests.
“Look at the catastrophic wildfires that we’ve had, and the U.S. Forest Service has come out with a wildfire crisis plan, because it is a crisis. The only way you can reduce the wildfire threats is to reduce the fuel loads, and the fuel loads are excessive right now,” Dane said. “The U.S. Forest Service needs to get back to managing the national forest like they used to do. And this rule, in and of itself, is not the sole reason that the health of the National Forest has declined over the last 25-30 years, but it’s one of the reasons.”
Environmental groups were quick to denounce the move by the federal government to open forestlands. The Southern Environmental Law Center said the rule was especially important for the southeast where land has been fragmented by roadbuilding and mining.
“They are the places that you’re gonna find old-growth forests. Virginia is lucky to have a lot of old-growth forest where you can find it in these roadless areas,” said Sam Evans, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Virginia also is lucky to have a wealth of clean streams and rivers. Five-hundred and forty miles of rivers in Virginia alone are protected primarily by the roadless rule.”
Even with the roadless rule’s future in question, the protected lands won’t be opened to free-for-all development. Formal rulemaking to undo the rule will be needed and it is likely to be challenged in court, as past changes were during the Bush Administration. 
“The Forest Service is going to have to explain why those things aren’t important enough to protect anymore. It is hard for me to see how they could do that credibly,” Evans said.
Another hurdle: even if the rule is rescinded, logging projects would still need to go through the Forest Service’s application process, which is subject to review in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.
But logging is not the only industry that could expand if the rule is undone. Oil and gas, hydropower, and mining could utilize the protected lands. Evans said when the rule originally was proposed in January 2001, most supporters said they wanted these protections in place for the wilderness portions of the country. He suggests it will be difficult for the Forest Service to convince the public the land should be allowed to be developed.
“An unprecedented number of people showed up to say that they wanted these protections, and that has continued to be true across the board irrespective of political affiliation, whether you live in the city, or you are in a rural area,” Evans said. “People really care about protecting the integrity of these lands and don’t want to see them converted into timber production.”

(Photo by Catherine Lane/Getty Images)Students in Virginia who rely on Pell Grants to help pay for college may soon face higher costs under a sweeping set of federal education reforms being considered by the U.S. Senate.
The Pell Grant program is the primary source of federal financial aid for low-income students, supporting degree completion at both public and private institutions. During the 2023-24 school year, Virginia’s public and private universities reported to the state that they had 144,116 Pell Grant recipients.
“It has been one of the great successes in helping lower-income families and students pursue a degree,” said Sabena Moretz, director of government relations and member services for the Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia (CICV). 
According to CIVC, 82% of students at Virginia’s private colleges receive financial aid, with an average award of $25,000. The association represents 28 accredited, nonprofit, independent colleges and universities around the commonwealth.
However, the proposed changes come as no surprise.
Back in 2016, President Donald Trump took aggressive steps to roll back Obama-era higher education measures, including a proposal to rescind the Gainful Employment Regulations that aimed to protect students from predatory programs.
In the latest effort, the Trump administration is backing a new legislative push dubbed the “One Big Beautiful bill,” a package of higher education reforms that includes changes to federal student loan programs, repayment rules, and institutional accountability. Supporters say the reforms would expand the Pell Grant to workforce training programs and help break the student debt cycle. 
Meanwhile, Democrats have opposed the bill, arguing that it would make college less affordable, eliminate borrower safeguards and protect predatory colleges.
One proposal in the bill would prohibit students from receiving a Pell Grant if their total grant aid from federal, state, institutional and private sources meets or exceeds their total cost of attendance — the estimated expenses for one year of college. These costs typically include tuition, room and board, and textbooks.
The changes are set to take effect on July 1, 2026.
A spokesperson for the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, declined to comment on the proposal. However, the office stated that it’s uncommon for financial aid to exceed a student’s costs of attendance.
“Having total aid exceed cost of attendance would be a rare occurrence, though it does happen,” said Lee Andes, SCHEV’s director of finance policy and innovation. “Since most financial aid rules (including the state) would require a reduction in aid under the scenario described, the student would receive no harm under the new federal policy compared to current policy.”  
Andes said that under both policies, a student would be limited to receiving no more aid than the total cost of attendance. 
“Traditionally, Pell has been treated as a first-in grant; this policy makes it somewhat ambiguous how it would be treated and which programs are reduced first. I would anticipate federal guidance to follow any change in the law,” Andes said.
CIVC said it is monitoring the discussion but remains concerned about how the proposal could impact students and institutions. Students at CIVC member institutions received $214 million in Pell funds during the 2023-24 school year. Moretz said if students find the application process difficult, they may choose to not enroll. 
In addition, if students no longer receive such grants, they may be unable to attend those institutions at all.
“The more complicated we make financial aid, the less likely students are to be able to follow along and to be successful at getting through the application process, and that does not serve students well,” Moretz said.
Virginia is not alone in its concerns about how the bill could impact students and colleges.
Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, wrote in a May 21 letter to House representatives that the council is concerned about changes to the Pell Grant eligibility, the availability of federal student loans for graduate students, new and increased taxes imposed on institutions of higher education, and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.
“If enacted, this bill will put college out of reach for hundreds of thousands of students, significantly increase the costs for remaining students, and weaken America’s ability to compete with our global rivals by undermining the academic and research system that has driven our economy for decades,” Mitchell wrote.
The Senate is also considering eliminating the Grad PLUS loan program, which provides funding for graduate students, potentially forcing them to seek private loans. Additionally, lawmakers are  weighing a new endowment tax targeting wealthy private institutions.
The endowment tax would raise the current 1.4% on private university endowments to a tiered rate based on endowment per U.S. student, excluding non-U.S. citizens from the calculation.
Democrats and other critics argue that the tax could also reduce funding for financial aid, research, and other essential operations.
The Senate is currently reviewing the bill, which passed the House last month.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)At one time or another, every one of us is impacted by a health emergency or life-changing event like the birth of a child. These moments in our lives can be all-encompassing, even when the underlying event is a joyful one.
Ask any parent. 
Adjusting to life with a baby is rich with stress, especially for single mothers like me. I am a single mom by choice. I gave birth to my son in May 2023. 
As a teacher, I received no paid time off for his birth. But because I gave birth at the end of May, I was able to stay home with him through the summer. 
Knowing that I did not want to leave my son at three-months-old, I took my 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave in the fall and returned to work after Thanksgiving.
I spent the full year before his birth squirreling away every cent I could save, even diverting the money I would have invested toward my retirement. I managed to save $12,000, which was no easy task. However, it was nowhere near enough to support my son and me. It was gone, along with other savings, before it was time for me to return to work. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thankfully, I have a very supportive family and was able to keep my head above water. 
Barely.
But here we are, my son just turned two-years-old in May, and I am still working to put myself back into a financial situation I’m more accustomed to and comfortable with at this point.
It is not easy. 
With a monthly daycare bill of $1,650, there is not much left over to spend at the end of the month, as I try to put a cushion back under my little family. 
My story is not unique. Many parents want to take time off to care for their newborns but find it financially impossible to do so.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Many countries offer paid family leave for new parents. So do 13 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., including four of our neighbors, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York.
There is no reason that Pennsylvania cannot do the same by offering paid family and medical leave for people who experience serious health conditions or life-changing events, like the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child. Leave should also be available to people who are caring for sick loved ones as well as victims of domestic violence.
A program like this would give Pennsylvania parents like me peace of mind by allowing them to care for their newborns without going broke. It would also allow family members to provide critical care to elderly loved ones at home without having to risk their jobs or financial security.

It is no wonder that a March 2025 poll by Osage Research for Children’s First PA found that 81% of Pennsylvanians support a paid family and medical leave program.
It’s also a win for employers who want to hang on to great employees. Studies (here, here and here) show that women with limited paid family leave are more likely to leave employment after childbirth or a health emergency, while those with paid family leave are more likely to return.
I wouldn’t change anything about the first six months of my son’s life, but I know that not everyone can do what I did. It breaks my heart to think of new moms returning to work just six or seven weeks after giving birth.
We can do better. We can empower working Pennsylvanians to provide critical care to their families when they need them. And we can do it in a way that benefits employees and employers, while keeping good people in their jobs.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)In Wise County earlier this month I met the candidate daring enough, or foolish enough, to run against the most powerful Republican member of Virginia’s House of Delegates. 
When I walked into the community center in Norton, where I was to give a presentation at the invitation of the Clinch River Coalition, I found a volunteer wrangling wires to plug in the audio equipment. He was introduced to me as Josh Outsey, the man who had taken on the thankless job of Democratic challenger to Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, in this fall’s election. 
Before I could stop myself, I laughed. Terry Kilgore has been in the House for 31 years, and ran unopposed in the last three elections. A politically powerful member of a politically powerful family, Kilgore represents a district that’s over 92% White and voted 83.1% for Donald J. Trump. The 63-year-old lawyer was recently elected House Republican leader.
Kilgore chosen to lead Va. House GOP as Gilbert prepares for possible exit

Joshua Outsey (pronounced OOT-see), 38, is a Black actor, singer and community organizer. As of June 5, Kilgore had raised $469,509, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Outsey had raised $200. 
Outsey gives a respectable pitch for his candidacy, grounded in both experience and policy. If this were a contest for a seat in a more balanced district, I’d have no business being amused. But no one, least of all Outsey, is under any illusions that he can unseat Kilgore. 
Still, I am filled with admiration. It is one thing to say that democracy works best when voters have choices, and quite another to agree to make yourself that choice against impossible odds. 
I’ve seen up close what even a hopeless campaign can require. A couple or three decades ago, my friend Tom Horton ran for Congress against a well-funded Republican incumbent who was firmly entrenched in Virginia politics. Tom had no trouble securing the Democratic nomination – nobody else wanted it – but he didn’t have money for a staff, and he needed a policy director. I was at home with young children and glad for the mental stimulation, so I signed on. 
Unburdened by any real prospect of success, I had a great time writing position papers based largely on my own opinions. Every once in a while, I would stop and ask myself, “I wonder what Tom thinks about this?” then shrug and plunge on. Very occasionally, Tom would balk at a position I proposed he take, and then we would talk it out.
But mostly, he didn’t have time for that. Poor Tom spent every day of the campaign on the phone trying to raise money. In the evenings he knocked on doors. If he was lucky, sometimes he was interviewed on the radio or got a quote in the paper. It was an uphill slog all the way, and none of it mattered. He lost by about the same wide margin that polls had shown him losing by at the outset of the campaign. 
He had to be disappointed, but Tom told me he loved every minute of it and would run again in a heartbeat, if he didn’t have a family to support.
Maybe this is why I have a special place in my heart for underdogs. People like Tom who try, knowing they are likely to fail, and then indeed do fail, only to pick themselves up and say it was worth it anyway – they are heroes to me. Winners are dull by comparison. 
Outsey is far from being the only sacrificial lamb this election. Democrats are fielding candidates in every House race this fall, including other long-shot seats like those held by Will Morefield, another coalfields delegate who won in 2023 with 85% of the vote, and Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, who won his Shenandoah Valley district by more than 77%.
Republicans are not similarly contesting every seat, but some are taking on Democratic incumbents even in deep blue districts, including a few who are making a repeat appearance on the ballot.
These include retired technology professional Kristin Hoffman, who is challenging McLean Democratic Del. Rip Sullivan for the second time, in spite of losing by 23 points in the last election. A few miles to the east, in another Fairfax County district that voted overwhelmingly for Harris over Trump last fall, retired federal worker Ed McGovern will face Del. Kathy Tran for a third time. He lost by 20 points in 2021 and 30 points in 2023.  
I was unsuccessful in trying to reach these folks, so I don’t know their motivations. Regardless, I salute them.
Running against impossible odds can serve a purpose beyond dedication to the democratic process. Democrat Melody Cartwright told a Cardinal News reporter that she sees running for a second time against Del. Eric Phillips, R-Henry, after losing in 2023 by 40 points, as a way to support Abigail Spanberger’s gubernatorial campaign. She added candidly that forcing Republicans to spend money to defend Phillips’ seat would leave them less money to attack Democrats elsewhere.
Despite tough challenge, don’t underestimate Earle-Sears

Running for office with no expectation of winning can also be a tactic for raising awareness of a neglected cause, as many a Green Party candidate can attest. My colleague at the Mercury, Roger Chesley, recalls a candidate by the name of Gail Parker who ran for various local, state and federal offices seven times between 2006 and 2019. Calling herself “Gail for Rail,” she campaigned on the single issue of promoting light rail. A 2007 Washington Post headline snarkily called her a “One-Track Candidate.” Fair enough, but the record will reflect that Metro now extends out to Loudoun County. 
Deep in the heart of every candidate, of course, is the hope that lightning may strike. The opponent might stumble badly enough, or voters suddenly realize that who they wanted all along was someone just like the scrappy upstart, leading to an upset victory. 
It has happened. In a 2014 primary, libertarian college professor David Brat defeated Congressman Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader at the time, in an upset that shocked the political establishment and gave hope to long-shot candidates everywhere. Brat won the general election, too, and served two terms.
Brat’s win over Cantor, followed by his loss to a Democrat in 2018 – to Abigail Spanberger, as it happened – demonstrates a final point: the political winds can shift suddenly, and when it happens, the people who benefit are the ones who’ve got their sails ready. 
Democrats have been able to field so many candidates this year because they sense such a shift coming as part of a backlash to the Trump presidency. Republicans say otherwise. Still, no matter which party wins control this fall, the outcome won’t help the longest of long-shot candidates. 
But that’s okay. Just running is a win for democracy.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)Renewed efforts by some lawmakers for the state to adopt a system where voters elect the state’s constitutional officers again failed this year. 
Maine is an outlier in having the Legislature appoint constitutional officers and state auditors. Rather than giving that power to state legislators, most states popularly elect their treasurer, secretary of state and attorney general. States vary more on how they select auditors. 
For decades, some lawmakers have proposed changing the selection process, such as allowing the public to decide instead through a direct popular election, but such attempts have failed. 
The Maine House of Representatives and Senate killed all of the proposals to change the selection process this year. 
LD 455, sponsored by Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), would have amended the constitution to require the popular election of the secretary of state, attorney general and state treasurer. Both chambers voted against it, so it died upon adjournment on Wednesday.  
LD 508, sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), sought to essentially do the same. The Senate indefinitely postponed it on June 11, killing the bill, on a motion from Bennett. 
Other bills, all sponsored by House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), focused on switching to popular elections for specific positions. 
LD 150 proposed a constitutional amendment to allow for the popular election of the state treasurer. It also died after the Senate followed the House in rejecting it earlier this month.  
That’s also the case for LD 147, which proposed a constitutional amendment to require the popular election of the secretary of state, and LD 149 that would do so for the attorney general. 
Bennett also offered an alternative election process for constitutional officers and the state auditor in LD 1193. Instead of a popular election, this bill would still have the Legislature elect these positions but with an open ballot system, under which a lawmaker’s vote would be publicly available. 
However, LD 1193 remained tabled in the Senate upon adjournment. Since it was not one of the bills carried over into next year, the bill died when the Legislature adjourned on Wednesday. 
Sen. Richard Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) proposed in LD 1068 switching to popularly elect the state auditor, though not through a constitutional amendment. That bill also remained tabled in the Senate upon adjournment and died since it was not carried over. 
The state auditor is not a constitutional officer, however another bill, LD 1052, sought to make it one through a constitutional amendment. 
Sponsored by Rep. Suzanne Salisbury (D-Westbrook), the bill passed both chambers in initial votes, however failed enactment in the House, which was the crucial vote as constitutional amendments need to win the support of two-thirds of lawmakers for enactment. The bill was then placed on what’s called the appropriations table because it required funding. 
Constitutional amendments ultimately have to be approved by voters even if they pass the Legislature, and therefore always have associated ballot costs. 
The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which manages the table, decided not to fund LD 1052 this year but it will be carried over into next year for consideration. (More on that here.) Though, if funded next year, this bill would still face a steep path to passage given the failed enactment in the House.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Thursday marked the last chance for New Hampshire lawmakers to approve or reject the remaining bills of this year’s legislative session.
While passage of a state budget was the main focus in Concord, lawmakers also voted on several bills that came out of this month’s committees of conference. The committees, made up of House and Senate negotiators, formulated compromises on bills that both chambers had passed but in different forms. On Thursday, the full chambers voted to either accept the compromises or kill the bills.
Bills passed on Thursday now head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, where she will have the option to sign them into law, veto them, or allow them to become law without her signature. Meanwhile, other hotly debated bills met their demise Thursday.
Here’s a look at some of the votes.
Gender affirming care for minors banned
After an emotionally charged debate, Republicans in the House and Senate passed two bills that would ban all gender transition surgery and medication treatment for minors. 
House Bill 712 prevents New Hampshire doctors from performing breast surgeries to assist with gender transitions; the bill would allow such surgeries only to treat “malignancy, injury, infection, or malformation.”
And House Bill 377 bars doctors from prescribing hormone therapies and puberty blockers to minors for the purpose of gender transition, as well.
The two bills, if signed by Ayotte, would come on the heels of a 2024 law that banned gender transition genital surgeries
The bills passed a week after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of such state laws in U.S. v. Skrmetti. 
Democrats denounced the bills, saying they would prevent adolescents with gender dysphoria from obtaining treatment that could improve their lives and prevent depression and suicide, and arguing that the decision of whether to pursue such treatment should be made by doctors and parents.
Republicans said there is not enough research backing up the treatments, and raised concerns that the treatments could be permanent and create trauma if children later regretted them.
Libraries and kids’ borrowing histories
Another bill accepted Thursday and headed to the governor’s desk seeks to allow parents access to their children’s borrowing history at public libraries.
House Bill 273, if signed by Ayotte, would require public libraries to make children’s borrowing histories available to their parents or legal guardians upon request. Under current state law, all library records are confidential outside of subpoenas, court orders, and the like. This bill would carve out an exception to that. 
Before Thursday’s vote, Rep. Bob Lynn, a Windham Republican, called the bill “another chapter in the continuing saga of protecting parental rights” and said it “is another chapter to complete, or almost complete, the circle” created when the Legislature passed — and Ayotte signed into law — House Bill 10.
HB 10, dubbed the Parental Bill of Rights, guarantees New Hampshire parents the right to ask school personnel for any information about what their child is doing at school and get complete disclosure. This sparked criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates, who were concerned teachers would be forced to out young gay or trans kids. The bill also reaffirms parents’ right to opt their children out of sex education classes, exempt them from vaccine requirements with a doctor’s note or because of religious belief, and home school them, among other things. Much of what is contained in HB 10 was already allowed, but the new law enshrined it into state law. Finally, the bill also required school boards to create new policies promoting parental involvement in their children’s education.
Many Democrats opposed the bill, however, including Rep. Paul Berch, a Westmoreland Democrat. Birch cited the bill’s lack of specificity about how a library would verify that someone is in fact a child’s parent.
“Why are we going to turn over private records without any verification,” he asked on the House floor.
A committee of conference last week simply had to agree on an effective date. Both parties quickly agreed on Jan. 1.
School buildings and migrant shelters
Both the House and Senate accepted a bill to prevent school buildings from being used as migrant shelters Thursday — after an unrelated provision regarding local property valuation was added to the bill.
House Bill 71, if signed by the governor, will forbid New Hampshire public schools, colleges, and universities from housing immigrants. Any school in violation would lose state funding. The legislation makes exceptions for short-term shelter during natural disasters, such as hurricanes or snowstorms.
However, when the Senate considered the bill, it added requirements for municipalities changing property valuations. The new provision seeks to require towns and cities with 10,000 or more people to publicize a change to a property valuation in a newspaper, online, and social media.
The bill was passed over the opposition of some Democrats. Rep. Muriel Hall, a Bow Democrat, said on the House floor Thursday that the legislation “infringes on local governments’ ability to effectively govern and make decisions about their own facilities, which could be empty for periods of time.”
Tilton Republican Rep. Lisa Freeman dismissed those concerns, saying “there’s a carve-out for states of emergency” in the legislation.
Voting bills sail through
The House and Senate passed a handful of bills designed to create stricter scrutiny of absentee ballots, amid a general push by Republicans to introduce more voter verification measures at the polls. 
Senate Bill 218 would require that those registering to vote as an absentee include documentary proof of citizenship, age, domicile, and identity with their registration form. The bill requires that that person registering sign an affidavit attesting to each of those qualifications under penalty of voter fraud, and it also requires a witness to sign an affidavit stating that they observed the registrant sign the application form and that the registrant “satisfied” the witness regarding their identity. 
Senate Bill 287 necessitates that people applying for absentee ballots include a copy of their identification as well as a signature from a licensed notary in order to obtain the ballot by mail. The applicant would not need a notarized signature if they appeared before their town or city clerk to apply for the absentee ballot ahead of the election.
Republican supporters say the bills would close off opportunities for voter fraud via the absentee ballot system. Voting rights groups countered that the bills would create high hurdles on voters with disabilities.
The Legislature on Thursday also passed a bill, House Bill 67, to require cities and towns to provide accessible voting machines in local elections — such as municipal elections and annual town meetings — and to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of State’s Office to share those machines. Under the bill, municipalities would be required to pay the costs to program the machines for their ballots.
But lawmakers also passed House Bill 613, which allows a town or city to not provide accessible voting machines provided they posted an announcement at least three months before the election asking voters to request the machines be available in writing. If no voter did so at least 60 days before the election, the municipality would not need to provide the machine, HB 613 states.
And finally, the House and Senate passed Senate Bill 221, which requires supervisors of the checklist to conduct an annual, comprehensive review of their lists of registered voters and to purge any voters that should not be on the list. Currently that review is required only once every 10 years, though election officials update voter rolls as they receive death notices. 
Lawmakers approve end-of-lease bill
Lawmakers passed a bill allowing landlords to terminate a tenancy at the end of the lease period with no “good cause” needed, which Republicans say is necessary to protect the sanctity of the contract.
House Bill 60 would apply to leases 12 months in length or longer, and would allow a landlord to stop renting to a tenant at the end of the lease period with no reason given as long as the landlord has given 60 days of notice. 
The legislation does not allow discriminatory evictions and states that the current anti-retaliation laws are still in place. 
But tenants’ rights advocates have criticized the legislation, which they say could still make it easier for landlords to discriminate against tenants without easy consequences, and which they argue will increase evictions and homelessness.
Republicans say allowing an easier means for landlords to end a lease means they will be more likely to take chances on tenants with poor credit scores or evictions on their record, knowing they can end the contract if it does not work out.
The final version of the bill exempts any “no cause” termination of tenancy from appearing as an eviction on the tenant’s record, addressing some concerns.
Mandatory minimums and shrooms
One bill that didn’t get approval from both chambers Thursday was Senate Bill 14.
That bill sought to impose mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted on fentanyl charges in New Hampshire. The bill would’ve required judges to sentence those convicted with 20 grams or more of the drug to at least 3½ years in prison, and those convicted with 50 or more grams would be sentenced to no less than seven years. Currently, there’s no minimum sentence for fentanyl charges under state law, meaning judges have more discretion. However, there is a maximum of 30 years for first-time offenders and life imprisonment for repeat offenders.
The bill, though, contained more than fentanyl sentencing. After the Senate passed it, Republican Reps. Kevin Verville and Terry Roy added a new provision to lessen criminal penalties for psilocybin, the psychedelic drug colloquially known as shrooms or magic mushrooms. The new amendment would’ve turned possession or use of less than three-quarters of an ounce of psilocybin from a felony into a misdemeanor on first offense. Verville, who has championed other bills meant to reduce punishments for certain drugs like psilocybin or marijuana, has argued psilocybin is much less dangerous than fentanyl and that it has medicinal benefits, such as treatment for PTSD and migraines.
Thursday morning, the House initially voted 183-186 to reject the compromise version of the bill. However, after a midday recess, the House regrouped and brought the bill back for reconsideration and on a second vote approved it, 185-182.
“Never stop the drive until you score,” Rep. Jason Osborne, House majority leader and a proponent of the bill, wrote on social media following the second vote.
However, the bill’s newfound hope subsequently died when the Senate considered it. The Senate voted to table it at the request of Sen. Bill Gannon, a Sandown Republican. Gannon had previously told House negotiators in the committee of conference that the psilocybin add-on was a nonstarter for the Senate. However, he was soon replaced on the committee by Sen. Daryl Abbas, a Salem Republican and vocal backer of mandatory minimums. The committee then approved a compromise deal with both the mandatory minimums and reduced psilocybin penalties. However, Gannon rallied enough Republicans to join with Democrats and shoot down the bill Thursday.
Enacting mandatory minimums was a legislative priority for Ayotte, who made it a campaign promise and has been publicly calling on lawmakers to get a bill across the finish line.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/campaignpromises-1024x554.jpg,,,2025-06-30 05:05:48.216339

In recent years, North Carolina Republican lawmakers have perfected the practice of rigging elections through partisan gerrymandering.
The situation has gotten so bad that they don’t even pretend anymore. They not only openly rig districts to disenfranchise voters who don’t vote Republican, they openly admit and brag about it.
And now, in a bill rammed through a House committee last week in record time, they’re bringing the same approach to election laws and the people who administer them.
Under a bill unveiled last week right before lawmakers commenced a summer break, the staff of the state Board of Elections – a group that’s always been scrupulously nonpartisan – would be transformed so that more than a third of existing staff positions would be converted to political appointees selected only by Republicans.
The bill includes other objectionable provisions too, including one that, –I’m not making this up– prevents local election boards from encouraging people to vote.
The bottom line: Election rigging through gerrymandering in our state is already scandalous. The new proposal is simply a travesty.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Changes will be made to the way abortions are reported in Ohio, according to the state operating budget the legislature passed last week. Meanwhile, infant and maternal funding are seeing reductions compared to previous versions of the budget.
Also, millions were set aside to provide ultrasound equipment specifically for entities that do not inform patients about abortion procedures and services as an option.
The Ohio General Assembly passed the state operating budget bill out of a joint conference committee last week, sending the bill to Gov. Mike DeWine for his signature, and possible line-item vetoes of his choosing.
The budget included language making changes to the Ohio Department of Health’s annual abortion report, and established a new monthly report as part of the changes. A “public electronic dashboard” will also be published monthly, according to budget documents.
Data collection for both the annual and monthly reports would now include the total number of Ohio residents versus non-Ohio residents who have “undergone an abortion and received post-abortion care,” according to the budget. Physicians are required to fill out reports on both surgical and medication abortions, which Jaime Miracle, deputy director of advocacy group Abortion Forward, said just adds to the bureaucracy that bogs down proper medical care.
“No one wants to wait longer to see a doctor because they’re busy completing extra paperwork to satisfy some politician’s agenda,” Miracle said. “Ohio already has some of the most medically unnecessary and burdensome reporting requirements around abortion care. No other medical procedure is required to be reported in the way abortion is.”

Those reports would get information on the patient down to the ZIP code of the pregnant individual, something pro-abortion rights advocates have said is a privacy issue.
“Sharing ZIP code level data is a threat to patient data and privacy and has no business being in the state budget,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.
Age categories would be altered under the budget bill, moving categories to younger than 16, 16 to 17 and 18 to 24.
The total of number of minors who received abortions will be included in the monthly and annual reports, separated out by the facility who performed the abortion. The number of abortions a patient has received and the total number of in-state versus out-of-state patients will also be broken down by age.
The deadline for the reports was also moved up by legislators. The public report will now be issued March 1 rather than Oct. 1.
  Separate provisions 
In other abortion-related budget provisions, the conference committee kept a provision from DeWine’s executive proposal that requires the Ohio Department of Health’s Genetic Services fund to be used for newborn screenings and genetic disease programs, but prohibited the use of the funds for abortion counseling or referral, “except in the case of a medical emergency.”
While the conference committee kept the overall provision, including the prohibition, it removed the exception for medical emergencies.
Kept intact was a Senate provision that gives $5 over the biennium to the Ohio Department of Children and Youth for the purchase of “3D diagnostic ultrasound machines,” to be distributed through a grant program.
The budget specifies, however, that the entities who are eligible to receive the ultrasound machines are those who do not “promote abortion, perform abortion-related medical procedures or make referrals for abortions.”
This could go to so-called pregnancy resource centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, which are typically religiously based and center their information and services on promoting pregnancy and discouraging abortion. The state – and DeWine through executive orders – has funded the centers with grant programs in the Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which has clear exceptions for those who provide abortion services or information.
The new budget even includes up to $750 per year in personal income tax deductions for those who donate to the centers, which could cost the state about $900,000 per year, according to budget documents.
Reproductive rights advocates have said not only do the anti-abortion measures pushed by the legislature negatively impact the state’s already low-ranking maternal and infant mortality rate, but the attention and money spent on anti-abortion measures take away from improvements that could be made.
The total appropriation for the “infant vitality” budget line went down from $20 million in the Ohio House proposal to $18 million in the conference committee-approved document. That number is a slight jump from the $16.8 million the state estimates for the fund in the current fiscal year.
Legislators gave $5 million to “programming by community and local faith-based service providers that invest in maternal health programs” and provide services to support pregnant mothers. But that number dropped in the budget process, from $7.5 million in the governor’s proposal and $6 million in the House proposal.
The final budget document removed a provision to use up to $1 million for non-medical services at residential infant care centers.
A provision to fund research looking into “causes, diagnoses, prevention and treatment” of pediatric cancer stayed cut in half from DeWine’s proposal, with the conference committee sticking to the House’s $5 million for fiscal year 2026, rather than the $10 million the governor had proposed.
$1.6 million was cut from funding for community projects that support “families, assisting families in avoiding crisis, and crisis intervention.”
The conference committee budget did include $5 million in each fiscal year from a Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, to be used to implement grant activities in “prenatal, maternal, perinatal and infant domains.”
A mental health block grant was also funded with $1.7 million each fiscal year for infant and early childhood mental health activities, and $6 million each year in funds from tobacco use prevention, cessation and enforcement would be used for awards, prioritizing “entities that serve women who reside in communities that have the highest infant mortality rates.”

Utah and other states have pushed the federal government to hand over public lands, and a sweeping proposal in Congress could put millions of acres up for sale. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ mega tax and spending bill, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Administration guidance around a lesser-known 1980s-era federal law regarding emergency abortion care has been rescinded by President Donald Trump’s administration, and could impact emergency room patients in Ohio.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted in 1986, with the aim to give peace of mind to patients entering emergency departments by making it law that patients must be treated and stabilized, or transferred to a hospital that can, regardless of income or insurance level. Hospitals risk Medicare and Medicaid funding if they don’t follow the law.
  Ohio hospitals 
The assurances held in the act include abortion services and care in the event of an emergency, which is why, when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, guidance was released by the U.S. Health and Human Services leader on how to continue under the federal law.
The letter from former Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized the protections in the act around “clinical judgment” and the the legal duty for physicians or other providers to “provide stabilizing medical treatment” to an emergency room patient above any “directly conflicting” state law.
“Thus, if a physician believes that a pregnant patient presenting at an emergency department, including certain labor and delivery departments, is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment,” Becerra wrote.
Earlier this month, however, the Trump administration rescinded the guidance, along with Becerra’s letter explaining it, saying the documents “do not reflect the policy of this administration.”
A statement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said the federal law would still be enforced, despite the removal of guidance.
But Jessie Hill, professor and director of the Reproductive Rights Law Initiative at Case Western Reserve University, said the action by the Trump administration will have impacts in states were abortion isn’t legal or is more restricted, and it “creates confusion for physicians who want to provide abortions in emergency situations because it’s not longer clear whether EMTALA permits that.”
“That said, even in states like Ohio where abortion is protected, it could have some effect,” Hill said. “In particular some hospitals – especially Catholic hospitals – will decline to provide emergency abortions except in the most extreme circumstances. This would be forbidden by the prior administration’s interpretation of EMTALA, but may be permitted by the current one.”
Local hospitals contacted by the Capital Journal said they are adhering to laws and providing care accordingly. Ohio also has a constitutional amendment that includes abortion care as one of the rights held in the state’s founding document.
“In terms of EMTALA, our legal landscape has been stable in Ohio,” a spokesperson for University Hospitals said. “Our approach at University Hospitals has not changed, and we provide appropriate clinical care.”
OhioHealth representatives said the system “will continue to offer care to our patients within the confines of any new regulatory landscape and always within the best practice standards of care.”
“If termination is medically necessary, OhioHealth health care professionals will take all measures to ensure the safety of the mother’s life, baby’s life or both,” a statement read.
The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center said it follows both state and federal laws, noting state law that restricts “abortions done in state institutions to those that are necessary for life-threatening maternal health conditions and pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest, which have been reported to police,” according to spokesperson Marti Leitch.
A request for comment from Mount Carmel Health System was not returned as of Thursday.
  ‘Real-life effect’ 
The federal law further entered the national conversation via an Idaho court case that ended up rising to the U.S. Supreme Court last year.
U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear Idaho case on emergency room abortions

The nation’s highest court, however, didn’t rule on the merits of the federal law, instead sending the case back to a lower court for further litigation. Because of that, a lower court ruling was allowed to continue, temporarily allowing abortions in emergency situations.
But it was the story of Ohioan Brittany Watts’ treatment that spurred U.S. House Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, to fight to reinforce the rights under EMTALA.
“What was important for me was to highlight the real-life effect of what happens when there is confusion and uncertainty around the law,” Sykes told the Capital Journal, “that this does not become commonplace where women are seeking health care thinking they can’t receive it.”
Watts was criminally charged after suffering a miscarriage at home, accused of abuse of a corpse. Watts had gone to St. Joseph Warren Hospital and was diagnosed with a condition that “endangered her pregnancy.” But after waiting for hours, she left and came back the next day. She waited several more hours, then returned home, where the miscarriage occurred, according to her attorneys.

A grand jury declined to return an indictment, and Watts has since sued the city of Warren, law enforcement officers and the hospital, claiming constitutional violations and violations of EMTALA.
The resolution introduced by Sykes and New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill looks to “reaffirm” that the emergency medical law protects access to emergency abortion care in every state.
Sykes acknowledged the uphill battle her resolution faces toward passage with Republican majority in the U.S. House and “a pretty dysfunctional Congress that does not particularly lend itself to the health care of women and the health care of people.”
In the language of the resolution, the sponsors say bans and restrictions on reproductive health care “put the health and lives of pregnant people at risk.”
They say state laws with bans or restrictions in emergency circumstances that “force medical providers to decide between withholding necessary, stabilizing medical care from a patient experiencing a medical emergency or face criminal prosecution” also risk the health of pregnant individuals.
Sykes said the importance of upholding the federal law is even more important now, with a budget reconciliation bill that could reduce Medicaid funding and Affordable Care Act subsidies, causing the loss of health insurance for “millions of people” and forcing hospitals to have to deal with uncompensated care, according to Sykes.
“If this program is cut in the way Republicans want … I am concerned about the ripple effects of what happens to all of the people in this country and their ability to pay … when they show up in the emergency department,” Sykes said.
Right now, the discussion is about emergency abortion care, but in the future, it could be car accidents or heart attacks, Sykes argued.
The concern about access and confusion on available care is shared by reproductive health advocates and researchers who say EMTALA not only helps patients, but also the physicians who are just trying to do their jobs.
“In places where we are seeing contestations and the creation of exceptions for EMTALA, that’s going to be a distraction for clinicians if they have to stop and check if the legal status is at odds with the standards that are laid out in the care,” said Danielle Bessett, a professor at the University of Cincinnati and co-principal investigator at the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, which focuses on abortion and contraception policies.
While abortion-related visits are generally uncommon, with research showing post-abortion ER visits are typically “for reassurance,” Bessett said the information individuals receive should be dependably accurate and complete.
Confusion of any kind when it comes to health care, particularly when it comes to emergency situations will be “to the detriment of our societal health,” and that includes confusion among lawmakers making policies with direct impact in the sector, according to Bessett.
“It really goes back to the post-Dobbs restrictions that we’ve seen,” she said, referring to legislation in states after the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. “They have an impact that goes beyond what lawmakers expected, because abortion is part of routine health care.”

(Getty Images)Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

“I am a doctor. I’m definitely not a politician, but I have been a lifelong public servant,” Acton said last week during a forum at the City Club of Cleveland.
“I’m running for governor because people in Ohio are struggling, and we continue to go backwards on nearly every measure because of special interests and bad actors at our Statehouse who keep taking us in the wrong direction,” she said. “It is time for a change, and I hear this everywhere I go.”
Acton gave a 30 minute speech which included talking about experiencing homelessness as a child, serving as the ODH director during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ohio’s need for change, and kindness. 
“All too often, kindness is mistaken for weakness, and that is a big mistake,” she said. “Everywhere I go, people are telling me that they want public servants again. They want us solving the problems of everyday life that we all face that aren’t political.” 
Those problems, she said, include the cost of living, aging in place, child care, safety, and schools. She also spoke out against gerrymandering, lack of maternity units in hospitals, and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. She also highlighted the importance of working together to tackle issues facing Ohioans. 
“You get people from every sector around the table because the wicked hard things we face, like housing affordability, can’t be solved by one area alone,” she said. “It can’t be solved by government alone. It takes non-profits and academics and universities and businesses all around the table trying to row in the same direction.” 
Acton, who is open about the struggles she experienced as a child, grew up in Youngstown. 
“I had a very, very rough childhood, very bad abuse and neglect up to the age of 12 (and) ultimately ended up homeless in the middle of winter,” she said.  
COVID-19 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Acton to be ODH director in 2019 and she quickly became a household name in Ohio during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. She accompanied DeWine during his daily afternoon press conferences in the spring of 2020 and helped translate complex medical terminology into plain English.  
“It was a profound honor to lead during COVID,” she said. “We literally flatten the curve. There’s great data now that shows it, and Ohioans rallied in every possible way. We saved a lot of lives, but most importantly, we’re also able to open earlier than a lot of places and get back to our lives because we took decisive action.” 
She received a mix of praise and criticism, and protesters showed up to her Bexley house. Acton resigned as state health director in June 2020 — months after Ohio’s first confirmed COVID-19 case. 
She said she didn’t step down because of the backlash she was receiving, but instead it was because she refused to sign an order.
“There was an order that was so egregious I could not do it … because it would have broken the Hippocratic Oath, it would have hurt people,” she said. “I could not sign my name to that order.” 
Acton said she was originally approached to run for office by two prominent Ohio Democrats — former Ohio Gov. Dick Celeste and former U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, “because I have a very strange constituency that does not know party, a bond formed during COVID.”  
Ohio Governor Race
Democrats are waiting to see if Brown will run for Senate or Ohio governor, or nothing at all. Currently, gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe, of Columbus, is the only announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026. 
The Ohio Republican Party endorsed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill is the only other GOP candidate running for governor, but Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel previously said he is considering running. 
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026. 
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.

But its safety-net cuts will cost Ohio and other states far more than it will save, according to a report published last week.
The deep cuts to health care under Medicaid, and to food support under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, wouldn’t only harm the most vulnerable, the report by the Commonwealth Fund and George Washington University says. It also would wipe out jobs, stifle state economies and diminish the tax revenue that state and local governments need to operate. 
The bill, which faces a Republican self-imposed July 4 deadline for passage, stands to destroy 1.2 million jobs in the United States by 2029 and shrink state economies by $154 billion, the analysis says. 
Proposed SNAP changes could swamp Ohio’s overburdened system

Some Ohio leaders have said that the changes proposed for SNAP would overwhelm an already overburdened system and increase hunger among children, the elderly, the disabled and the working poor. They say the Medicaid cuts would cost 770,000 mostly working Ohioans their health coverage.
The Commonwealth Foundation-George Washington University report says the bill’s blast radius is far wider than that.
Ohio would lose $4.5 billion in federal funding, it says. The state’s GDP, or economic output, would drop by $5.2 billion. State and local tax revenues would drop by $3.66 billion by 2029 as well, it said.
Ohio job losses, roughly half of them in the health sector, would be 44,700, or 0.8% of the workforce, it added.
Trump and congressional Republicans are justifying the cuts because they would shrink federal spending on Medicaid and SNAP by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. But that doesn’t take into account the direct and indirect harm that would be done to the broader economy.

“Our study reveals another, less discussed consequence of the budget cutbacks: the damage to state economies and loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, amounts that greatly exceed any federal savings,” the Commonwealth Fund-George Washington University report says. “More than a million people will lose their jobs, particularly in the health care sector. Hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes will close, many of them in rural and low-income communities. The need to compensate for the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding will mean that state and local governments will have to consider cuts in other public services, such as education or infrastructure, just as they lose billions of dollars in state and local tax revenue because of the economic dislocation these policies cause.”
Meanwhile, the economic justification for Trump’s proposed tax cuts is dubious. 
They’re titled heavily in favor of the richest Americans. Of the $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
The Commonwealth Fund-George Washington University analysis said that the cuts under the Republican bill would suck money out of the pockets of poor families while it stuffs it into those of the rich — and as it plunges all of us deeper into debt.
“By cutting safety-net programs, the House budget bill reduces resources for low-income households (the lowest 10% of earners) by an average of $1,600,” it said. “At the same time, the bill’s tax cuts increase resources for high-income households (the highest 10% of earners) by $12,000. Despite the spending cuts, the bill would increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion, including about $500 billion in higher interest costs.”
Tax cuts for the wealthy have long been sold on promises that they’ll juice the economy and everybody will benefit. But there’s little evidence to support that. 
For example, the Trump tax cuts of 2017 weren’t even half the size of those contemplated under The One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Even so, they added $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the deficit, the Tax Policy Center estimates.
Trump claimed the corporate tax cuts that were part of the package would add $4,000 to median household income. But it was found to add nothing at all for families making $114,000 a year or less, while it led to vast increases in executive salaries, the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities reported.

(Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)On Saturday, June 7, I walked through South Park in Lawrence with my husband. We were browsing booths set up to for the annual LGBTQ+ pride celebration.
There had been a parade to start the day’s festivities, a parade we didn’t attend because it was pouring rain. But the skies soon cleared, and despite swampy patches in the grass and puddles on the concrete, the pride persisted. Hundreds of people circulated through the park, wearing an array of rainbow garb and chatting among themselves. A stage set up in the street played queer-themed hits such as Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club.”
The crowd was a portrait of diversity — old people, young people, middle-aged people, of all colors and races, of different levels of physical ability. I saw parents with children, couples, extended families and individuals, all part of a giant toast to equality. As we browsed among the crowd, I couldn’t help but think how different this was from current narratives about gay rights.

“How the Gay Rights Movement Radicalized, and Lost Its Way,” New York Times, June 26.
“Supreme Court OKs Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for kids, a setback for transgender rights,” Associated Press, June 18.
“Hegseth directs renaming of Navy ship honoring LGBT icon Harvey Milk,” Washington Post, June 27

Headlines paint a movement on the retreat. But I didn’t see that in Lawrence. Instead, a saw a movement growing up, expanding its reach and readying itself for battles ahead.

I won’t deny that I wiped aside a few tears.
Liberty and justice for all might go in and out of fashion. But equality remains essential if you care about other human beings in both Kansas and the entire United States. So many people had dedicated their lifetimes to getting where we were that June 7. And many more will dedicate their lifetimes to making sure that we go on celebrating, no matter what.

What’s practical
In general, I believe that politics and policy should engage more with the practical and possible than the idealistic.
If two sides appear irreparably divided, participants should figure out what small things they agree on, rather then focusing on their most yawning divides.
For the overwhelming majority of public policy issues, this makes good sense. If your opponents want a lower tax rate, and you want taxes at a higher rate, you can you can compromise on a tax rate somewhere in the middle. If you want government to spend more on one kind of service and your opponents want it to spend less, you set spending in between those proposals.
We’ve watched Republican senators engage in just this kind of horse trading on President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” over the weekend. When people say that lawmakers should work together, they usually mean something like this. Find compromise. Move forward.
But when it comes to equality, this approach becomes much more difficult.
There’s no middle ground between saying that one group of people has the same rights as you and saying that they don’t have those rights and should be ashamed of asking. Compromising on full equality means denying it. You can’t be partly equal, or as the shameful U.S. Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson put it, separate but equal.
Compromise can still improve the lives of marginalized groups. Half measures can increase the range of rights and privileges enjoyed by one kind of people or another. For instance, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — or DACA — transformed the lives of immigrants brought into the United States as children. It did not grant them full citizenship, but the program didn’t harm them.
Still, compromise can grate on the march toward full equality. Civil unions did not last long as a compromise measure for same-sex couples. Both they and many straight people decided that expanding the definition of marriage to include gay people actually strengthened the institution. It was, and remains, win-win.
As the headlines above suggest, the LGBTQ+ community has recently experienced backlash. I had hoped that we might avoid this, but oppressors don’t like to see their carefully assembled basket of privileges overturned. They will fight wildly to retain their imagined superiority.
But it is only imagined.
No amount of racist rhetoric, homophobic grumbling or ultraconservative legislatures can change the fact that discrimination is wrong. Treating people differently because of innate traits cannot be defended. It will always be wrong. And those who seek to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people or Black people or Jewish people or people of color or any other group you care to name will always be mistaken. They will find themselves on the ash heap of history.

Pushing forward
This basic moral truth is why social movements continue.
This is why gay people and their allies flood the streets for pride marches — not just in Lawrence but also in Budapest, Hungary. This is why Black people and their friends and supporters mark Juneteenth. Those of us who know what it’s like to face institutionalized legal discrimination do not forget.
I am perfectly capable of holding a polite conversation with someone who believes that I am less than a full human being. But I know the harms their beliefs have caused. I will still judge them.
Those on the far right like to accuse anyone to their left of moral relativism. Yet I cannot imagine a more morally objective, idealistic goal than full legal equality for all people. When it comes to individual rights, when it comes to the freedom of people to be who they truly are, we can share a noble goal.
As a gay man, I’ve been stunned to see how far America has moved during my lifetime. I now live with my husband and son in a state where being gay was actually illegal.
I have no illusions. The job’s not done, will probably never be done. We still have much ground to cover in gaining basic legal rights for LGBTQ+ people. 
Yet as we walked through that sodden-yet-heartening event in early June, I chose to focus on the positive for a few minutes. LGBTQ+ people will not give up, cannot give up, because this is who we are. These are our lives, and we are just as worthy, just as American, just as human, as anyone else. Happy pride to all.

Unlike doctors and hospitals, which use AI to help diagnose and treat patients, health insurers use these algorithms to decide whether to pay for health care treatments and services that are recommended by a given patient’s physicians.
One of the most common examples is prior authorization, which is when your doctor needs to
receive payment approval from your insurance company before providing you care. Many insurers use an algorithm to decide whether the requested care is “medically necessary” and should be covered.
These AI systems also help insurers decide how much care a patient is entitled to — for example, how many days of hospital care a patient can receive after surgery.
If an insurer declines to pay for a treatment your doctor recommends, you usually have three options. You can try to appeal the decision, but that process can take a lot of time, money and expert help. Only 1 in 500 claim denials are appealed. You can agree to a different treatment that your insurer will cover. Or you can pay for the recommended treatment yourself, which is often not realistic because of high health care costs.
As a legal scholar who studies health law and policy, I’m concerned about how insurance algorithms affect people’s health. Like with AI algorithms used by doctors and hospitals, these tools can potentially improve care and reduce costs. Insurers say that AI helps them make quick, safe decisions about what care is necessary and avoids wasteful or harmful treatments.
But there’s strong evidence that the opposite can be true. These systems are sometimes used to delay or deny care that should be covered, all in the name of saving money.
 A pattern of withholding care

Presumably, companies feed a patient’s health care records and other relevant information into health care coverage algorithms and compare that information with current medical standards of care to decide whether to cover the patient’s claim. However, insurers have refused to disclose how these algorithms work in making such decisions, so it is impossible to say exactly how they operate in practice.
Using AI to review coverage saves insurers time and resources, especially because it means fewer medical professionals are needed to review each case. But the financial benefit to insurers doesn’t stop there. If an AI system quickly denies a valid claim, and the patient appeals, that appeal process can take years. If the patient is seriously ill and expected to die soon, the insurance company might save money simply by dragging out the process in the hope that the patient dies before the case is resolved.
This creates the disturbing possibility that insurers might use algorithms to withhold care for expensive, long-term or terminal health problems , such as chronic or other debilitating disabilities. One reporter put it bluntly: “Many older adults who spent their lives paying into Medicare now face amputation or cancer and are forced to either pay for care themselves or go without.”
Research supports this concern – patients with chronic illnesses are more likely to be denied coverage and suffer as a result. In addition, Black and Hispanic people and those of other nonwhite ethnicities, as well as people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, are more likely to experience claims denials. Some evidence also suggests that prior authorization may increase rather than decrease health care system costs.
Insurers argue that patients can always pay for any treatment themselves, so they’re not really being denied care. But this argument ignores reality. These decisions have serious health consequences, especially when people can’t afford the care they need.
 Moving toward regulation

Unlike medical algorithms, insurance AI tools are largely unregulated. They don’t have to go through Food and Drug Administration review, and insurance companies often say their algorithms are trade secrets.
That means there’s no public information about how these tools make decisions, and there’s no outside testing to see whether they’re safe, fair or effective. No peer-reviewed studies exist to show how well they actually work in the real world.
There does seem to be some momentum for change. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which is the federal agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, recently announced that insurers in Medicare Advantage plans must base decisions on the needs of individual patients – not just on generic criteria. But these rules still let insurers create their own decision-making standards, and they still don’t require any outside testing to prove their systems work before using them. Plus, federal rules can only regulate federal public health programs like Medicare. They do not apply to private insurers who do not provide federal health program coverage.
Some states, including Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Maine and Texas, have proposed laws to rein in insurance AI. A few have passed new laws, including a 2024 California statute that requires a licensed physician to supervise the use of insurance coverage algorithms.
But most state laws suffer from the same weaknesses as the new CMS rule. They leave too much control in the hands of insurers to decide how to define “medical necessity” and in what contexts to use algorithms for coverage decisions. They also don’t require those algorithms to be reviewed by neutral experts before use. And even strong state laws wouldn’t be enough, because states generally can’t regulate Medicare or insurers that operate outside their borders.
 A role for the FDA

In the view of many health law experts, the gap between insurers’ actions and patient needs has become so wide that regulating health care coverage algorithms is now imperative. As I argue in an essay to be published in the Indiana Law Journal, the FDA is well positioned to do so.
The FDA is staffed with medical experts who have the capability to evaluate insurance algorithms before they are used to make coverage decisions. The agency already reviews many medical AI tools for safety and effectiveness. FDA oversight would also provide a uniform, national regulatory scheme instead of a patchwork of rules across the country.
Some people argue that the FDA’s power here is limited. For the purposes of FDA regulation, a medical device is defined as an instrument “intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.” Because health insurance algorithms are not used to diagnose, treat or prevent disease, Congress may need to amend the definition of a medical device before the FDA can regulate those algorithms.
If the FDA’s current authority isn’t enough to cover insurance algorithms, Congress could change the law to give it that power. Meanwhile, CMS and state governments could require independent testing of these algorithms for safety, accuracy and fairness. That might also push insurers to support a single national standard – like FDA regulation – instead of facing a patchwork of rules across the country.
The move toward regulating how health insurers use AI in determining coverage has clearly begun, but it is still awaiting a robust push. Patients’ lives are literally on the line.

Nineteen states now have a law or policy banning transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity.
About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings. The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “common-sense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year. South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law earlier this year when it passed the state budget. The bathroom policy became law last year when it was inserted into part of the state budget, which must be renewed each year.
The Arizona legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)As the recent stench of war grew stronger, I noticed once again how much we love our machines, be they bunker-busting or surgical, life-saving or high-earning, analog, digital or artificially intelligent. But what happens when our doodads and thingamajigs act human … you know … err?
To wit: Last week in this space, the modern marvel autocorrect changed one letter in one word (“defund” to “defend”) in one sentence, in one paragraph of an entire 750-word commentary. The “correction” altered the entire meaning of the piece. But those were simply the details.
More pressing appears to be that we’re moving from machines being able to help us express our thoughts and ideas to machines making them for us — intentional or not. All in the name of technological progress. 
Common wizardry
Such wizardry as autocorrect, ChatGPT or any of a number of AI tools is commonplace today, whether to construct a good declarative sentence or to plan and execute a bombing mission 7,000 miles away. I’m only speculating on the latter, but surely AI played some role when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Perhaps AI will also be used to resolve with accuracy the debate between “obliterate” and “two months,” a chasm both linguistic and political.
We can stop already with that annoying longing for the good old days. The AI genie is long out of the bottle and is not going back in. While government, business, medicine, manufacturing, agriculture and science race to capitalize on its wonders — which are legion and spectacular — we should also know and embrace its limitations. 
Please don’t confuse me with the Luddite down the block. I have for some time embraced technology, even making peace as a former professor of academic writing with the untimely death of the college essay at the impressive hands of large language learning models such as the aforementioned ChatGPT. 
You remember ChatGPT: Feed some information into it, such as “Write 600 words making the case for slavery reparations.” Click once and within 30 seconds, you have yourself a serviceable essay, probably in the realm of “Cs get degrees.” A second try might ask it to provide two citations. Which it will. (C+?) Try it. Perhaps you’ll want to retake Comp 101 from freshman year.
But, as I’ve written before, what is missing in these essays is a sense of humanity, not simply in language but also in tone, word choice and if you will, a measure of the writer’s passion for the subject — none of which, to date, ChatGPT can provide. A productive bot may be many things. A moral being is not one of them.
Our health can be affected, too. A critical reading of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” uncovered serious flaws, including citations of research that did not exist. Whether or not AI was used to generate the report remains unclear. This much is clear: It makes little difference whether it was the bots or the humans. The information was wrong. 
Often right
AI gets it right most of the time. The question we have to ask ourselves is whether most of the time is good enough. Is it better than a human most of the time? Worse? I’m intolerant of one incorrect word out of 750. What would be our tolerance level in war, surgery, a banking transaction or an immigration hearing?
These AI problems, called hallucinations, have led to PR disasters for American businesses from McDonald’s to Sports Illustrated to Amazon. Mickey D’s had to scuttle its foray into AI ordering when a video of the AI “crew member” ringing up an order of 260 Chicken McNuggets after the customers had begged it to stop went viral. SI somehow gave bylines to AI-generated authors, and Amazon was hyping a recruitment tool that somehow only recruited men.
Pardon my cherry picking. Regular readers here know that of all the modern barriers between us and a better future, access to the truth is paramount. AI can be a powerful force in that kit of democracy’s tools. AI and someone accountable for it.
Had last week’s autocorrect snafu gone unedited, the republic would have survived. But as we edge forward (or backward) with cease fires and bombings and the potential for a wider war, we should ensure all the AI and technological wizardry we have at our disposal has a capable human — a moral agent — attached.
To read more about AI and hallucinations, Google them. An AI bot will tell you all you need to know.

(Photo by Anteia McCollum/Idaho Capital Sun)Update: This story was last updated at 9:10 p.m. Mountain time on June 29.
Two people have been killed and another is injured after firefighters in north Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris.
Kootenai Health spokesperson Kim Anderson said three victims were brought to the hospital, the Associated Press reported. Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries, Anderson said, according to the AP.
“The wounded firefighter’s condition wasn’t known,” the AP reported.
The fire was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near the east side of Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene. The shooter opened fire around 2 p.m., Norris said at a Sunday afternoon press conference.
At about 8:50 p.m. Sunday, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that a responding SWAT team located a dead man with a rifle nearby on Canfield Mountain.
A shelter-in-place order from the Kootenai County Emergency Management system has now been lifted, according to the sheriff’s office.
However, the brush fire is still burning because firefighters had to suspend their response while the shooter was still active.
“There is still an active wildfire on Canfield Mountain,” Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a post on Facebook. “Local residents should be prepared and ready in the event that the situation escalates. Please continue to follow official sources for accurate information.”
The Canfield Mountain area has been designated a no-fly zone, “including a strict prohibition on drone use,” the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in Sunday night press release. “Unauthorized aircraft or drones in the area pose a serious risk to firefighting and law enforcement operations.”

 Shooter opens fire on firefighters responding to emergency call

“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said at the Sunday afternoon press conference.
Norris said he believes that the two people killed were firefighters. The responding fire crews, which included three engines, were dispatched from from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue and the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.
“We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris said at a press conference at 4:35 p.m. Pacific time. “This is an active situation. We have multiple agencies that are on scene from local and federal authorities, and we are prepared to neutralize this suspect who is currently, actively shooting at public safety personnel.”
The sheriff said “it appears modern-day sporting rifles are being used” in the attack.
Norris said law enforcement is unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers. He said officers and deputies are reporting from the scene that the shooter is “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said at the afternoon press conference. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Multiple local North Idaho, state and federal agencies have responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, said in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure and process the scene.

“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, both R-Idaho, also posted on X that they are monitoring the reports on the incident and are praying for the first responders and their families.
“I am monitoring the horrific reports out of Coeur d’Alene this evening,” Crapo posted. “I urge local residents to follow recommendations of law enforcement. My prayers are with victims and first responders.”
In a statement at 7 p.m. Sunday, Idaho House Republican leadership said they were “shocked by such a vicious attack.”
“We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues,” the statement said.
An additional press conference is scheduled for 9:30 p.m. tonight, according to a Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office press release.

Ned Lamont sounded to be in complete denial about both the moment we are living in and just how disappointing his own decisions have been since Donald Trump took office.
It amazes me completely that after seeing historic primary turnout, engagement from new voters, and massive activation of young volunteers coming together to defeat a corrupt and scandal-ridden candidate who Lamont himself endorsed, Lamont’s tone is anything other than “it’s time to scrap the old playbook.” This complete inability to read the room is unacceptable given the moment we are in nationally, and we must demand more. 

Shontá Browdy
As a working-class mother in Hartford and a member of its board of education, I find that this administration is, at best, ignoring residents in my city and, at worst, outright hostile to us.
Our governor continues to vehemently defend our state’s irrationally strict fiscal guardrails, which have made it virtually impossible for my school district to even dream of someday having fully funded schools for our children.
On top of that, he remains the main barrier to our state being able to raise equitable tax revenue, meaning that the state budget remains balanced on the backs of working people rather than on billionaires. In what world does it make sense for you and me as workers to be responsible for paying for our state’s many needs while Connecticut’s wealthiest residents continue to coast on capital gains and inherited wealth? 
The governor’s recent vetoes of an affordable housing bill and a measure for unemployment insurance for striking workers, coupled with his threat of vetoing a bill that would have protected our immigrant neighbors from Trump’s ICE kidnappings, speak volumes. We’ve reached the point where we have to ask: “Can a governor of immense personal wealth genuinely be the voice fighting for working people in Connecticut?” 
Right now, we face relentless budget cuts from the federal government, paired with federal tax breaks for the same super-wealthy billionaires that our state refuses to tax locally. Meanwhile, in my role on the board of education, I witness the way our state’s austerity leads to a lack of resources, overcrowded classrooms, and missed opportunities for the very students who need the most support.
By remaining loyal to the illusion of “responsibility,” we are creating entire generations of students who will struggle and come to believe that their government does not give a damn about them. 
It’s time for our state’s leadership to truly listen to voices from places like Hartford, and to learn lessons from historic elections across the region. We need fiscal policies that are flexible, compassionate, and truly reflective of the significant needs of our residents in childcare, education, and healthcare.
We cannot afford a governor who is this out of touch; we need a leader who understands that true fiscal responsibility means investing in our people, our future, and especially, our children.

The vast majority of Americans are skeptical of AI and want it slowed down. This is the moment for Massachusetts to show its leadership.
The post Mass. must resist Congress’s proposed moratorium on state AI regulation appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PRESIDENT TRUMP has demanded that Congress pass his “One Big Beautiful Bill” by July 4, putting enormous pressure on the House and Senate to move quickly.
The House version passed on May 22 gave tech industry lobbyists a massive victory tucked deep in the bill: a 10-year moratorium on state law regulating the development or deployment of AI. 
Since then, members of Congress, tech executives, researchers, and more have decried the potential harms of preempting states from constraining the potential dangers of AI for a decade—a lifetime for this rapidly accelerating technology. And yet the proposal is largely intact in the most recent Senate version of the bill, even though the vast majority of Americans are skeptical of AI and want it slowed down.
This is the moment for Massachusetts to show its leadership on AI. As we have previously written, the state has taken action to support AI development with the new Massachusetts AI Hub. But global leadership isn’t just the propulsive development of new technology; it’s making sure that such innovation benefits, and does not harm, real people. Unfortunately, Massachusetts lags in lawmaking to protect citizens, consumers, kids, and workers from the harms of online platforms and AI.
Dozens of bills have been introduced in the Massachusetts Legislature to address a wide variety of potential AI harms. For example, S.264 would require companies to disclose when the online representative you’re talking to is not a human, and hold them accountable for statements made by their virtual agents. S.44 would prohibit misleading deepfakes shared before elections. S.994 would preclude landlords from using AI to collusively set rents. 
Beacon Hill should draw national focus to the threat of a federal AI regulation moratorium by immediately holding joint hearings, passing meaningful regulation on AI, and – as we do in other policy domains – fighting alongside other states in court for our laws and rights if the moratorium gets enacted.
Contrary to the AI industry’s assertions, regulating technology to protect people’s well-being actually creates pressure for better innovation. The Clean Air Act of 1970 didn’t just reduce air pollution but fundamentally transformed automotive technology, leading to computer-controlled engines, advanced materials science, and sophisticated emission control systems that are now standard worldwide. The Americans with Disabilities Act’s web requirements led to breakthrough innovations like voice search, predictive text, and flexible interfaces—features that benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.
The federal moratorium, if passed this summer, would have little direct impact on Massachusetts because we have yet to enact the kinds of protections Congress threatens to undermine. Some on Beacon Hill have publicly opposed the federal preemption of AI regulation. But the Commonwealth has not yet taken action to back up this rhetoric.
Other states, however, are actively legislating AI policy to protect their citizens. New York just passed comprehensive security and safety requirements for AI model developers. New Hampshire prohibits state agencies from using AI to surveil the public. Florida prohibits certain uses of deepfakes in political advertising. California requires disclosure when providers use AI to communicate with health care patients. Moreover, in the absence of federal action on digital technology and online platforms, other states have moved to restrict smartphones in schools, protect kids online, strengthen users’ control of their data, and enhance consumer privacy.
These laws are in their infancy, but their existence will enable us to learn what policies work best to govern and steer AI so that we can eventually scale them nationally to benefit all Americans. But the prohibition in the “Big Beautiful Bill” on state regulation of AI would destroy states’ vital role as policy labs exactly when we need them the most — as AI is poised to bring generational upheaval to our lives, our communities, and our society.
Throughout its history, Massachusetts exemplified the American tradition of US states as laboratories of democracy. It has been a national leader in policy innovation to protect people and improve their well-being. 
It was the first state to require kids to attend school, passed the nation’s first minimum wage law, and one of the first workers compensation laws, helping establish the modern system of workplace injury protection. More recently, the Commonwealth’s universal health care mandate became the model for the popular Affordable Care Act that has provided health insurance to more than 50 million Americans. 
Now, Massachusetts must meet the moment and lead in the digital age to protect its people from the harms of AI and steer this transformative technology in the public interest.

Don Bacon, finds himself in position to cast a potentially pivotal vote. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — President Donald Trump and Republican leadership in Congress are pushing a presidential-pressured deadline of July 4 to send a “big” tax and spending bill that Trump calls “beautiful” to the president’s desk. 
And once again, Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District Republican, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, finds himself in position to cast a potentially pivotal vote, after expressing concerns over Senate Republicans’ efforts to find more cuts to Medicaid in their version of the bill to offset the rising costs of the megabill. 
The bill would make the tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for high earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, boost funding for immigration enforcement, start funding Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program and accomplish other goals from Trump’s domestic agenda. The bill also cuts the social safety net, adding new requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.
Fight over details
The Trump tax bill has multiple provisions that several different groups of Republicans have issues with, which have caused Republican leadership on the Hill to try to wrangle Congress and House Republicans to be lockstep. 
Bacon told the Examiner in recent days that he had received assurances that the bill would not degrade the quality of healthcare for people covered by Medicaid. He also was part of a group of 16 House Republicans who said they won’t support the Senate’s reconciliation bill if it cuts the Medicaid provider tax rate 
“I love Senator Ricketts and Senator Fisher, but hearing, ‘We got to put our own fingerprints on the bill,’” Bacon said, “Well, please don’t do it on Medicaid, put your fingerprints on some other places.” 
After some hiccups with some parliamentary rulings, Senate Republicans appear to be on track to pass their version and send it back to the House later this week, in time for Trump’s deadline. Congressional experts have estimated that the package would add $3.253 trillion to the debt during the next decade, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Some Senate Republicans have proposed cutting more from Medicaid via an amendment that would reduce federal government spending on Medicaid in states that expanded the program as a result of the Democrats’ 2010 health care law. 
Voters in Nebraska and a combination of voters and legislators in 40 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, have supported Medicaid expansion, according to the health care research organization KFF.

The House version introduces Medicaid’s new work requirement, shortening the enrollment period and eliminating what Republicans describe as “waste, fraud and abuse” in the system by adding more paperwork. 
The proposed change in the House version, also in the Senate bill, would require able-bodied people and working-aged individuals to show the government proof of employment to remain on the program every six months. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 5.2 million adults would lose Medicaid coverage due to the stricter requirements, which are expected to save the federal government $280 billion over six years.
Bacon said he can “defend that all day long.”
“We’re doing smart savings and protecting those who need it under the house plan,” Bacon said in an interview late last week. 
Senate-House squabble
Bacon said the Medicaid cuts that the Senate is proposing are undermining the strength of the GOP’s argument of going after “fraud and abuse” and also emphasized that he didn’t like specific provisions in the bill, such as those related to SNAP. 
For months, state lawmakers, left-leaning political advocacy organizations, medical professionals, activists and some everyday Nebraskans have expressed concerns about the “disastrous” consequences of the “one, big beautiful bill’s” Medicaid cuts for healthcare access and rural hospitals.

Angie Lauritsen, state director of the political advocacy group Nebraska For Us, said Bacon has sided “with the ultra-wealthy over the Nebraskans he was elected to serve” but said he could “redeem” himself. 
“Does he want to stand with the ultra-wealthy or will he finally put working families first?” Lauritsen said. 
Scrutiny of Bacon’s position on the bill could prove less effective after news broke that the retired Air Force brigadier general is not seeking reelection in 2026, causing political shockwaves as he represents one of the nation’s most competitive congressional districts.
Bacon has been pushing back on the Senate version of the bill, as both Nebraska senators — U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts do interviews on the importance of preserving Trump’s tax cuts. 
“We want to make sure [we] deliver on our promises to the American people,” Fischer said on Fox News. “We can’t see these tax cuts expire.” 
Few places have faced more political pushback to the bill than in swing districts like Nebraska’s 2nd District, with its slight GOP tilt.  A bipartisan group of state lawmakers in Nebraska expressed concerns in a letter to Nebraska’ U.S. senators over how the Trump Tax would impact SNAP. Republicans and Trump have pushed back on the framing of the reductions as cuts. They say they are targeting abuses.
At least one of the most recent Senate versions would require states to cover some of the costs of SNAP benefits, which are currently mostly funded by the federal government. Senate Republicans are also considering additional reductions to the program than the House version, which independent analysis shows would likely cut at least 3 million people from the program. 
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon will not seek reelection in Nebraska’s 2nd District

“Nebraska would be on the hook for approximately $16 million in benefit costs and an additional $12.1 million in administrative expenses to maintain program operations,” the letter from Nebraska lawmakers read. “These policy choice dynamics would put significant pressure on our state budget and may result in reduced benefits or more restrictive eligibility.”  
Still deciding
Bacon said he wouldn’t know how he would vote until the Senate had passed its amended version.
Bacon has emphasized that he has received concessions or reassurances from House leadership for his vote. As Bacon told the New York Times earlier this month — he “doesn’t like voting “no” but likes “fixing things.” He also told the national outlet that he was a “no” on advancing a White House request to claw back $9.4 billion that the federal government had already approved for international aid and public media funding — but flipped his vote after ‘reassurances’ of some funding for AIDS help and public media.
He also told the national outlet that he wouldn’t follow his party ‘off the cliff.’ Multiple polls indicate that Trump’s signature piece of legislation is unpopular among Americans who are aware of it. 
Former White House employee Elon Musk has criticized the legislation, saying “destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm” to the nation. He has been especially critical of how much it adds to the national deficit and debt. 
For Bacon, he said he liked the direction the Senate version was taking. 
“I’ve had a lot of media saying, Are you going to support the Senate’s version?” Bacon said. “I don’t … know.”

(Anteia McCollum/Idaho Capital Sun)Two people have been killed after firefighters in North Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris.
The incident was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene.
“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a social media post. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and other emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure the still-active scene.

As this…
— Brad Little (@GovernorLittle) June 29, 2025

Norris said in a press conference Sunday evening that law enforcement is unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers. He said officers and deputies are reporting from the scene that the shooter is “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said.
The brush fire is still burning, and Norris said that until the shooter is caught, emergency personnel cannot respond to it.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Multiple North Idaho, state and federal agencies have responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, that in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race was already set to be one of the most closely watched elections in the country next year.
That attention reached new heights after U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican who has held the seat since 2014, announced Sunday he would not seek another term.
“I still look forward to continuing to serve North Carolina over the next 18 months,” Tillis said in a statement. “I look forward to solely focusing on producing meaningful results without the distraction of raising money or campaigning for another election.”
North Carolina’s race will be crucial in a midterm cycle that will play key role in determining control of razor-thin majorities on Capitol Hill. While Republicans aim to hold the seat for another six years, Democrats are seeking to flip it and turn the state’s U.S. Senate delegation purple.
Multiple candidates have already made campaigns for the seat official. Now, with the incumbent stepping aside, North Carolinians can expect to see contested primary elections on both sides of the aisle.
The Cook Political Report, as of Sunday, rated the North Carolina race “lean Republican,” though that could change with news of Tillis’ retirement.
Here’s who has announced their intention to run for the seat; who’s taken their name out of the running; and who could still throw their hat in the ring.

Who’s running
Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel (D) — Nickel was the first major candidate to enter the race. He served one term in the U.S. House before Republican-friendly redistricting spurred him to drop his re-election bid.
Nickel is a criminal defense attorney who previously served in the state Senate. He’s repeatedly tied Tillis to President Donald Trump, and has proposed that Democrats form a “shadow cabinet” to monitor and respond to the Trump administration.
He has just over half a million dollars on hand as of April, according to campaign finance filings.
“It doesn’t matter what MAGA Republican Trump handpicks for North Carolina,” Nickel wrote on social media Sunday. “I’m the Democrat running because WE CAN flip our great state blue and win back the Senate majority.”
Don Brown (R) — Brown, a former U.S. Navy JAG Officer, author and attorney from Charlotte, provided aid to those who participated in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. He has billed himself as “your America First candidate.”
He has done little fundraising thus far, raising just $21,600 as of April.
  Former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
Who’s not running
Mark Robinson (R) — Robinson’s campaign for governor in 2024 was derailed by a series of controversies and scandals, and he came up well short against Gov. Josh Stein.
He said in January he “will not run” for the seat, and that he did not intend to seek elected office in the future.
But he has remained an active voice online, frequently blasting Tillis and calling on conservative activists to oust him and other Republicans he deems not satisfactory. And it remains a possibility, however remote, that he could reverse course in the wake of Tillis’ retirement — though he would face major opposition from national party leaders if he chose to do so.
Robinson’s former campaign spokesperson, Matt Hurley, wrote online Sunday that Tillis’ retirement “is the end of a terrible era in North Carolina politics.”
“A new era of grassroots leadership in North Carolina is coming… you can count on it,” Hurley wrote.
Robinson shared the post and chimed in: “I couldn’t have said it better.”
Who could run
Former Gov. Roy Cooper (D) — The former two-term governor is widely viewed as the most prominent and formidable potential Democratic candidate.
Cooper is a familiar name in Democratic politics — a former attorney general and state senator. His name recognition, fundraising and political connections would make him an instant favorite for the party’s nomination if he chooses to run.
  North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper outlines the damages and relief money needed after Hurricane Helene at a press conference on Oct. 23, 2024 in Raleigh. (Photo: Galen Bacharier)
However, he’s yet to make an official decision. In the meantime, Cooper has served as a teaching fellow at Harvard University’s public health school.
Since 1986, 48% of governors who ran for U.S. Senate seats have been elected, according to data from Ballotpedia. Democrats have won 16 of those races, lost 12, lost six in the primary and had one withdraw before the primary.
Lara Trump (R) — The president’s daughter-in-law has for years been floated as a possible North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate. Tillis’ retirement provides an opening for her to make a run official.
She’s married to the president’s son Eric, grew up in Wilmington, and attended undergrad at NC State University. Last year, she was elected co-chair of the RNC along with another North Carolina figure, Michael Whatley. She resigned from the post in December 2024, and currently hosts “My View with Lara Trump” on Fox News.

Trump’s strength as a candidate speaks for itself — sharing name recognition, connections and fundraising with the leader of the Republican Party and its most significant endorser.
But any rumors of her candidacy could once again be just that — as they were ahead of a North Carolina seat in 2022, and amid a Senate opening in Florida late last year. She stepped away from the field on both occasions.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson (D) — Jackson has run for the U.S. Senate before — he launched a campaign during the 2022 cycle, before later suspending his campaign and backing the eventual nominee, Cheri Beasley.
The open seat provides a path back to Capitol Hill for Jackson, who served a term in the U.S. House before winning the attorney general’s office last November.
But it remains to be seen whether he would choose to jump back into the political fray only a short time into his first term in the AG’s office, which has also been a stop for Cooper and Josh Stein before winning the governorship.

Jackson said Sunday he respected Tillis’ decision to end his tenure “when he felt the time was right,” and praised his vote against the Trump-backed budget mega-bill.
“I saw that he spoke about having the pure freedom to call balls and strikes over the next 18 months, and I genuinely look forward to that,” Jackson said. “It’s the approach that will serve North Carolina best and I’m glad to see that’s how he sees his mission with his remaining time in the Senate.”
Dan Bishop (R) — Bishop, a loyal Trump supporter, lost the state attorney general’s race to Jackson in November. Instead, the former congressman has remained in Washington — serving as deputy director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.

He served two districts across three terms in the U.S. House. And during his prior stints in the North Carolina legislature, he authored the controversial “bathroom bill” restricting transgender people’s access to public restrooms.
Michael Whatley (R) — The head of Republicans’ national elections machine could jump into a race himself.
Whatley formerly served as chair of the North Carolina GOP before being elected chair of the Republican National Committee last year, a position in which he still serves.
The nonprofit news outlet NOTUS reported Sunday that Whatley was considering running for the seat, citing an unnamed source.

North Carolina’s U.S. House delegation (D & R) –Any of the state’s 14-member House delegation could aim to make the jump to the higher chamber.
Four of them are Democrats — including U.S. Rep. Don Davis, who represents one of the most closely contested districts in the country. U.S. Reps. Deborah Ross, Valerie Foushee and Alma Adams are also multiple terms into their House tenure. Ross was the Democratic Senate nominee in 2016, losing to then-incumbent Republican, Richard Burr.
Of the 10 Republicans, U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx is the most senior, having served since 2005. But if Foxx were to run, she’d be sacrificing significant power as the chair of the Rules committee. And she is one of the 10 oldest members of Congress, having turned 82 on Sunday.

Another possibility is U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who leads the campaign arm for House Republicans. NOTUS also reported the possibility of a Hudson campaign Sunday.
Spectrum News reported Sunday that U.S. Reps. Greg Murphy, Pat Harrigan and Tim Moore are also considering campaigns.
North Carolina’s legislative leaders (D & R) — The most prominent legislators on Jones Street could aim to make the jump to Washington.
Among them are Republicans Phil Berger, 72, who has been Senate leader for more than a decade, and Destin Hall, 37, the newly-ascended Speaker of the House.
The Democrats’ caucus heads are House leader Robert Reives, 54, and new Senate leader Sydney Batch, 46.

Free.,Nonpartisan analysis of US Senate GOP mega-bill finds it adds $3.2 trillion to deficits,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nonpartisan-analysis-us-senate-gop-mega-bill-finds-it-adds-32-trillion-deficits,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans’ revised tax and spending cuts package will add $3.253 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law, according to analysis the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released Sunday.The latest score came just hours before senators were set to officially begin floor debate on the sweeping package that will extend the 2017 GOP tax law, rework how much state governments have to contribute to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, overhaul several aspects of Medicaid and cut its spending, restructure higher education aid programs and much more.Senators voted mostly along party lines late Saturday to proceed with the legislation, though leaders had to hold the vote open for more than three hours as they worked to get the votes needed.The revised 940-page package still needs to undergo changes in the coming days, after the parliamentarian ruled Sunday morning that another six provisions must be revised to comply with the rules or be removed from the bill. One Alaska sweetener knocked outGOP senators cannot include, or might need to restructure, language meant to bring Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski on board by enhancing the federal matching rate for Medicaid in two states with high poverty guideline levels: Alaska and Hawaii. The program for low-income people and some people with disabilities is run as a state-federal partnership.Since Hawaii is represented in Congress by a Democratic delegation, the Republican benefit would largely have applied to Alaska’s two GOP senators.Senate Republicans did receive some good news from the parliamentarian in her latest ruling, which cleared language that will steadily lower the maximum percent states can set for Medicaid provider tax rates from the current 6% to 3.5% in 2032.The in-the-weeds policy has caused considerable frustration among GOP senators across the political spectrum, who argued a prior version would likely cause financial strain for rural hospitals by beginning the process one year sooner.Planned ParenthoodThe parliamentarian is still reviewing several other policy changes in the bill, including whether Republicans can prevent Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year, effectively blocking beneficiaries from receiving care there at all.Federal law already bars federal taxpayer dollars from going toward abortions with limited exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. So this change would prevent Medicaid patients, who may have few other options, from using Planned Parenthood for other types of health care, like annual physicals, contraception and cancer screenings.A prior version of the bill blocked federal funding from going to Planned Parenthood for the next decade.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom about how the rulings might impact the bill going forward.Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote in a statement the latest rulings show ""that Republican attempts to give away goodies that benefit certain states will not pass muster under Senate rules.""“Senate Democrats have also successfully challenged a giveaway to Big Pharma, as well as policies that make it harder for seniors and kids to get affordable health care through Medicaid,"" Wyden wrote. ""Republicans wanted to bring back the health care tactics of yesteryear, like waiting periods, lock-outs and annual limits on care, but Democrats have wrestled these out of the bill. I am disappointed that the Republican rewrite of the provider tax changes will remain in the bill: this policy will force states into devastating cuts to health care that seniors, kids and Americans with disabilities depend on. We will continue to fight any attempt to sneak through harmful health care policies in this morally bankrupt legislation.”Lengthy debate, amendment fights aheadRepublicans hope to pass the entire package before the Fourth of July, though they have several hurdles to jump over before they can meet that goal.Senate floor debate can last up to 20 hours, which means it likely will last until early Monday morning. After that, senators will begin a marathon amendment voting session where members of each political party can propose changing or removing certain pieces of the legislation.GOP leaders generally like to avoid public disputes within the party but the rules of reconciliation don’t really allow that and several Republican senators are expected to offer amendments.There is no time limit or cap on the number of amendments that can be offered during vote-a-rama, so that can last hours or even days in theory.Whenever Democrats and Republicans decide they’ve debated their last amendment, they’ll move on to voting to approve the Senate’s version of the “big, beautiful bill.” That could come Monday or Tuesday.At least 50 Republicans need to vote to approve the measure, with Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote. More than four GOP senators objecting to the overall bill means it cannot pass as it's written.Thom Tillis, Rand PaulRepublican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with debate so it’s likely they will vote against final passage as well.

Free.,"US Senate launches debate on GOP mega-bill, but passage still not assured",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-launches-debate-gop-mega-bill-passage-still-not-assured,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate began floor debate on Republicans' “big, beautiful bill” Sunday afternoon, though there are several steps to go before the legislation can become law, and any one of those could lead to additional GOP opposition — potentially dooming the measure. Senators must wrap up an ongoing review of the bill with the parliamentarian to ensure it meets the strict rules for using the reconciliation process and then run the gauntlet during a marathon amendment voting session.Additional changes to the sweeping tax and spending cuts package, some of which were being worked on as debate took place, need to garner the support of nearly every Republican in Congress. Otherwise, it will never become law.Senate Majority Leader John Thune signaled during a brief hallway interview there may be enough votes for a new twist in the Medicaid changes in the bill — an amendment reducing in some way how much the federal government spends on Medicaid in states that expanded the program as a result of Democrats’ 2010 health care law. The federal government currently pays 90% of the costs for enrollees in the expansion.“We're going to do what we can to support the effort,” Thune said, referring to an amendment offered by Florida Sen. Rick Scott that was not yet public. “It's great policy and something that there's a high level of interest in our conference in getting made part of the bill, and obviously scores a substantial savings.""But Thune, R-S.D., sidestepped a question about whether making that change would create vote-count issues if Republicans in the House with affected districts object, potentially preventing the bill from reaching President Donald Trump’s desk.“We have had some of these conversations with (Speaker Mike Johnson) and others over there, and then also with our colleagues for some time,” Thune said. “But I think the way this is designed, and the way that Sen. Scott has written it; it should be something that I don't know how Republicans couldn't be in favor of what he's trying to get done here.“So, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Obviously, we've still got to get into the debate over here and get through the amendment process and we'll see what the fate of the amendment is on the floor.”Currently 41 states, including the District of Columbia, have adopted the Medicaid expansion, according to the health care research organization KFF.A Scott spokesperson told States Newsroom they would share his amendment once it was final.Still fluidTypically when a major piece of legislation comes to the Senate floor the text is set and amendment debate is closely controlled to ensure delicately negotiated deals don’t crumble in full public view.That isn’t the case this time around and much could change before senators take a final passage vote later this week, potentially as soon as Tuesday.GOP leaders using the complex reconciliation process to move their signature policy bill through Congress means every provision must have an impact on federal spending or revenue that is not “merely incidental.""That involves Democrats and Republicans going before the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s official referee, to argue over dozens of provisions. She then decides if a given policy meets the strict and sometimes murky rules.That process hadn’t yet wrapped up when debate on the megabill began and is expected to continue as the 20-hour clock ticks down toward a marathon amendment voting session.Senate bill would add $3.2 trillion to deficitsThere are also increasing concerns among Republicans, including those in the House Freedom Caucus, over how the bill will impact the federal government’s balance sheet during the next decade.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced Sunday morning the Senate’s revised tax and spending cuts package will add $3.253 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law.Trump appeared to try to assuage concerns through a social media post.“For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,” Trump wrote. “Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.”The latest score came just hours before senators officially began floor debate on the sweeping package that will extend the 2017 GOP tax law, rework how much state governments have to contribute to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, overhaul several aspects of Medicaid and cut its spending, restructure higher education aid programs and much more.Senators voted mostly along party lines late Saturday to proceed with the legislation, though leaders had to hold the vote open for more than three hours as they worked to get the votes needed.Even after taking that crucial procedural step, the bill continued to evolve.The parliamentarian ruled Sunday morning that another six provisions must be revised to comply with the rules or be removed from the 940-page package. One Alaska sweetener knocked outGOP senators cannot include, or might need to restructure, language meant to bring Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski on board by enhancing the federal matching rate for Medicaid in two states with high poverty guideline levels: Alaska and Hawaii. The program for low-income people and some people with disabilities is run as a state-federal partnership.Since Hawaii is represented in Congress by a Democratic delegation, the Republican benefit would largely have applied to Alaska’s two GOP senators.Senate Republicans did receive some good news from the parliamentarian in her latest ruling, which cleared language that will steadily lower the maximum percent states can set for Medicaid provider tax rates from the current 6% to 3.5% in 2032.The in-the-weeds policy has caused considerable frustration among GOP senators across the political spectrum, who argued a prior version would likely cause financial strain for rural hospitals by beginning the process one year sooner.Planned ParenthoodThe parliamentarian is still reviewing several other policy changes in the bill, including whether Republicans can prevent Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year, effectively blocking beneficiaries from receiving care there at all.Federal law already bars federal taxpayer dollars from going toward abortions with limited exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. So this change would prevent Medicaid patients, who may have few other options, from using Planned Parenthood for other types of health care, like annual physicals, contraception and cancer screenings.A prior version of the bill blocked federal funding from going to Planned Parenthood for the next decade.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom about how the rulings might impact the bill going forward.Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote in a statement the latest rulings show ""that Republican attempts to give away goodies that benefit certain states will not pass muster under Senate rules.""“Senate Democrats have also successfully challenged a giveaway to Big Pharma, as well as policies that make it harder for seniors and kids to get affordable health care through Medicaid,"" Wyden wrote. ""Republicans wanted to bring back the health care tactics of yesteryear, like waiting periods, lock-outs and annual limits on care, but Democrats have wrestled these out of the bill. I am disappointed that the Republican rewrite of the provider tax changes will remain in the bill: this policy will force states into devastating cuts to health care that seniors, kids and Americans with disabilities depend on. We will continue to fight any attempt to sneak through harmful health care policies in this morally bankrupt legislation.”Amendment fights aheadRepublicans hope to pass the entire package before the Fourth of July, though they have several hurdles to jump over before they can meet that goal.Senate floor debate can last up to 20 hours. After that, senators will begin a marathon amendment voting session where members of each political party can propose changing or removing certain pieces of the legislation.GOP leaders generally like to avoid public disputes within the party but the rules of reconciliation don’t really allow that and several Republican senators are expected to offer amendments.There is no time limit or cap on the number of amendments that can be offered during vote-a-rama, so that can last hours or even days in theory.Whenever Democrats and Republicans decide they’ve debated their last amendment, they’ll move on to voting to approve the Senate’s version of the “big, beautiful bill.”At least 50 Republicans need to vote to approve the measure, with Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote. More than four GOP senators objecting to the overall bill means it cannot pass as it's written.Thom Tillis, Rand PaulRepublican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with debate so it’s likely they will vote against final passage as well. Two more senators deciding not to back the bill would halt its momentum, at least until GOP leaders could make changes to get their votes.Tillis on Sunday announced he would not run for reelection, after being attacked by Trump for voting against advancing the legislation.Senate approval of the bill would send it back to the House for a final vote, though centrist and far-right members of the Republican Conference in that chamber have voiced concerns about changes made in the upper chamber.Johnson, R-La., will need to keep nearly every one of the 220 House GOP lawmakers supportive if that chamber is to send the legislation to  Trump for his signature before Friday.",,,,2025-06-29 18:01:56.099076

Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Tillis, 64, became a member of the state House of Representatives in 2007 before rising to become speaker in 2011. He held that position until 2014, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.Tillis secured reelection in 2020 with 48.7% of the vote compared to his Democratic opponent’s 46.9%. The two were separated by fewer than 96,000 votes out of more than 5.2 million cast.His term will officially expire in January 2027, but the contest to replace him is expected to begin quickly.2026 electionRepublicans will want whoever emerges from their primary well positioned to fend off a general election challenge. Democrats will be just as focused on the Tar Heel State as they look to regain control of the Senate following the 2026 midterm elections.Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate and while the map is highly favorable to the GOP, Democrats are expected to spend a considerable amount of time and money trying to flip seats.North Carolina and Maine are the two most likely pick-up opportunities for Democrats and an open seat in North Carolina could help them a bit. But Democrats still face long odds to flip other seats in deeply red states like Alabama, Florida, Montana and West Virginia.The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates both Maine and North Carolina as leaning toward Republican wins next year, though that could change closer to Election Day and with the Tillis news.Democrats not only need to pick up several seats to regain control of the Senate but will need to defend an open seat in Michigan and Sen.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Richard Randall Sr. was a fan of President Donald Trump’s crusade to beef up border security — that is, until a wrong turn onto a local military base left his “little buddy” in a big bind and Randall with a whole different perspective.

A lifelong Nebraskan, U.S. Navy vet and dad, Randall had developed a father-son-like relationship with Jazon Gonzalez Perez, a Guatemalan migrant who managed a couple of local restaurants in the Plattsmouth area where Randall lives. He described Gonzalez Perez as an inquisitive, eager-to-learn hard worker.
The mentorship had grown to the point that Gonzalez Perez called Randall on June 7 when he — while looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work — wound up in a snag with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A cell phone search had led Gonzalez Perez toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base, where he was stopped and detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.
Gonzalez Perez called Randall, who told the Nebraska Examiner he was blindsided by seeing immigration agents take away his buddy. He said conversations with on-site local law enforcement officers led him to believe Gonzalez Perez would be allowed to leave if Randall drove the car. 
Randall said it looked as though the plain-clothed ICE agents were called into duty unexpectedly. One brought a child with him as if the two had been on a family outing. 
“I said, ‘Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. He’s a good kid. He just made a wrong turn,” Randall said, recounting the episode. “I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists. 
“He’s none of those.”
 Expected ‘God-fearing’ workers last 

Gonzalez Perez now sits in ICE custody at an Iowa jail, awaiting possible deportation for being in the country without proper authorization. And Randall says he is fuming over tactics he said turned out not to be what he voted for last November. 
He expected “God-fearing” workers to be last in line. For the Plattsmouth-area resident who considers himself an independent swing voter, a different reality has “hit home” and shifted his mindset on federal immigration enforcement.

“Call me naive, but my clear understanding was we were going to go after the bad actors, not hardworking immigrants,” said Randall. 
His frustration intensified in the days after the Offutt turn, as ICE and Homeland Security Investigations on June 10 detained nearly 80 workers from a worksite raid at an Omaha food plant. Not since a 2018 immigration operation in and around O’Neill, which ensnared 133 workers, had Nebraska seen such a large-scale enforcement action.
ICE officials said the raid at Glenn Valley Foods was prompted by a federal criminal search warrant suspecting widespread use of stolen identifications by workers there to gain the jobs. So far, available federal court records show three of the workers that were detained have been charged criminally as a result of the operation, including one for stolen ID, though an ICE spokeswoman said Thursday the probe continues.
Raids were conducted days prior to Omaha’s in places such as a Home Depot and in a garment district in Los Angeles, sparking protests that then spilled across the country. Trump’s call for the Marines and California National Guard troops without the consent of that state’s governor escalated tensions.
Polling shows Randall is not alone in his frustration, as people witness the reality of stepped-up immigration enforcement at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration. 
A CBS News survey conducted June 4-6 — prior to widespread protests of ICE arrests in Los Angeles — found 54% of people approved of Trump’s approach to deportations. 
A more recent Quinnipiac University poll, released June 26, indicated 41% of voters  approved of the way Trump is handling immigration issues, compared to 46% who approved three months earlier in the university’s poll from March. 
Approval from independent voters on the immigration question dropped to 32% from 41% in March.

Trump himself has delivered conflicting signals, reportedly ordering officials on June 12 to tap the brakes on raids at farms, hotels, restaurants and meatpacking plants. Days later, his social media post called for federal officials to “do all in their power” to deliver the “single largest mass deportation” program in history. His major targets: the Democratic strongholds of Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
 Flip flop

The flip-flopping concerns leaders at the Omaha-based Center for Immigrant & Refugee Advancement, saying it “further erodes trust for immigrant communities.” 
CIRA, which provides legal services statewide, said any claim that enforcement is focused on “dangerous” individuals does not align with what its lawyers are seeing on the ground. It said mothers and fathers, including some who had been in the U.S. for decades, are being “ripped” from their families.
“This is not a public safety initiative — it’s political theater and our communities are paying the price,” the statement said.
According to TRAC, a widely-used national clearinghouse that tracks immigration and detention trends, ICE as of mid-June reported detaining 56,397 people  — up from 38,525 a year ago and a record high since 2019 when the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse began publishing semi-monthly statistics.
TRAC said nearly 72% of the detainees had no previous criminal conviction. Of the 28% who did, TRAC said many had been convicted of offenses such as minor traffic violations.

Longtime Omaha immigration attorney Rachel Yamamoto said she has noticed a pivot by federal officials to go after “easy pickings, low-hanging fruit,” apparently to meet the reported quotas of up to 3,000 arrests daily demanded by the Trump administration. 
She pointed out her own clients: a mother-daughter duo detained June 4 at an appointment that in years past was a routine “check in.” 
Maria De Leon of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, had entered the U.S. in 2014, with 3-year-old daughter Hermelinda in tow. She was released at the border to await a “credible fear” interview with federal officials that came six years later.
Her plea to stay was denied, and she was under an Order of Supervision to check in annually with immigration officials, Yamamoto said. Federal officials did not violate any rules in detaining De Leon, the attorney noted, as the food plant worker had an outstanding order of removal. But she called it “a drastic change from usual procedures.”
“She’s been on this order of supervision since 2014,” Yamamoto said of De Leon. “Everything was fine every year, until now. She’s never been arrested. She’s had a work permit. Her husband is working legally.” 
Yamamoto and De Leon’s husband, who was waiting in another room, were particularly taken aback that Hermelinda, 14, also was detained. Yamamoto was with the mom and daughter when agents asked the teen to empty her pockets. She pulled out her phone and a lip gloss.
“That moment was horrible,” Yamamoto said. “Her eyes got big, like, ‘Am I being detained right now?’ I’m glad they didn’t cuff them.”
In past experience, Yamamoto said, youths typically were allowed to stay with the other parent. De Leon’s husband, Abel, had arrived in the U.S. two years prior to his wife and daughter, fleeing gangs, and has had an active asylum application pending for more than a decade in a backlogged court system. The couple’s 10-year-old son, born in the U.S., remains with dad in their South Omaha home.
De Leon’s family received word a few days later that mother and daughter were together in a family ICE facility in Texas. Yamamoto said the mom likely has no chance to stay in the U.S., though Hermelinda appears eligible for an asylum interview. 
 Businessman’s view

Immigration arrests have increased nationwide and more than doubled in 38 states since Trump took office Jan. 20, the New York Times reported Friday.
Nebraska has averaged 4.3 daily arrests — a 343% rise from 2024, the newspaper reported, based on data obtained through a Freedom of Information lawsuit by the Deportation Data Project at the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.
The data covers administrative arrests (those in which ICE seeks to deport rather than criminally prosecute the arrestee) conducted by the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division through June 10. It does not include criminal arrests, arrests made by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations divisions or Customs and Border Protection.
From a small businessman’s perspective, Gary Jenkins of Omaha said he was confused and in unfamiliar territory when a Guatemalan crew member was apprehended by ICE agents who followed him and his brother on a recent Saturday work morning into a gas station.
Omahan who is U.S. citizen spends two nights in jail on immigration ‘hold,’ drawing criticism

Jenkins said he jumped into action to find legal help for the man he said reported loyally to housing renovation job sites for years. He described the man, in his early 40s, as a father of three. His understanding is that the worker had missed an immigration court date in New York while living in Omaha.
Soon after his detention, the man was returned to his homeland. His wife and kids remain in the Omaha area, as does a brother, who Jenkins says has legal status.
“These guys are over here doing great work,” he said. “Now I have to go out and find somebody I can trust and believe in.” 
Federal officials paint a different picture. Mark Zito, special agent in charge of a Homeland Security Investigations office that covers Omaha, recently took aim at people supporting workers detained at Glenn Valley — pointing out havoc that can occur if an undocumented worker uses a stolen Social Security number to gain employment. 
Federal officials have said that 100 “real victims” face financial and emotional consequences as a result of their identities being used fraudulently at Glenn Valley.











These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans.


– Mark Zito, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations office in Omaha 



“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” Zito said in a statement. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives, isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
ICE offered a handful of examples, including: a Texan struggling to get Social Security disability payments as their ID was being fraudulently used to earn wages at Glenn Valley; a Coloradoan asked to repay $5,000 after their income was falsely increased due to wages earned at Glenn Valley, and a nursing student from Missouri losing out on college financial assistance because fraudulent use of ID pushed up income. 
 Gov. Pillen calls hard workers ‘A-OK’

Longtime South Omahan Sharon Boll sees the complexities, and sides with Trump policies.
She recently sat in a lawn chair watching an anti-ICE rally unfold in her neighborhood. She expressed empathy for families separated by deportations and trying to fix their residency status and respected the right to protest. 
“I know the long citizenship path is a pain in the butt, but they need to be here legally,” said Boll, who had a large framed image of Jesus Christ propped on a chair next to her.  “A lot less harm will come to them.”
Even Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, — quick to say he is “a 100% supporter of ICE” — has revealed a nuanced opinion of immigration enforcement, depending on the situation.

He said he has been to the border: “I’ve seen criminals and terrorists and kids being loaded like pack mules full of fentanyl and synthetic methamphetamines coming from China. Safety is the highest calling of government, that we get the criminals and terrorists out of here. That’s the focus and what I believe in.”
Pillen told the Nebraska Examiner he was “not talking about” established immigrant families, though, and urged Congress to “fix the immigration issue.” 
“Anybody that is here working hard and being a good neighbor, they’re A-OK. They’re fine,” Pillen said.
He said he did see a problem at the Glenn Valley operation because of “concentration of folks doing criminal activity of stealing people’s ID — that’s a grave offense.”
 Stopped at Offutt gate 

Randall said he had been supportive of Trump’s crackdown when he understood the target to be high-level criminals.
Admittedly, he said he does not know all the intricacies of immigration law and what it takes for a foreign-born worker to enter or remain in the country with U.S. permission. He said he is familiar, however, with the manager at one of his go-to diners that he came to know as a sort of “adopted son.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Over time, he learned that Gonzalez Perez had left his homeland to try and make a better living and help his siblings. His dad is a farmer in Guatemala, and his mom is deceased.
On a recent Saturday, Gonzalez Perez set out to make a bank deposit for his employer. The regular bank site was closed at the time. His boss told him it could wait, but Gonzalez Perez said he wanted to make sure payroll could be met, said Randall.
The online search led Gonzalez Perez to a satellite branch on the Offutt base property. A statement from Offutt’s public affairs chief said the man was detained at the gate, after presenting a Guatemalan ID card rather than a valid driver’s license.

Per security protocol, 55th Wing Security Forces contacted the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office and ICE “due to the individual operating a vehicle without a valid license and presenting a foreign identification card with no documentation authorizing access to the installation,” said Kris “Krispy” Pierce, who heads public affairs for the 55th Wing and Offutt. 
“The safety and security of our installation and personnel remain our highest priority,” said Pierce.
Randall, called by Gonzalez Perez, said he first spoke by phone to an onsite sheriff’s deputy and, based on conversations, believed he would be able to drive his friend off base. Upon arriving, he found Gonzalez Perez sitting in his car blocked by cones. 
Immigration agents later arrived, ran information through a device and put his friend in handcuffs, respectfully and without incident, Randall said. Gonzalez Perez is in ICE custody at the Pottawattamie County Jail.
 ‘Tipping point’

Gonzalez Perez has an immigration court hearing scheduled in early July.
His attorney said she prefers not to comment on the case.
Randall said he is monitoring closely. He believes deportation and immigration policy could be a political “tipping point” for independent voters like himself. 
“I’m all for arresting bad actors. I think we all are,” Randall said. “That’s not what happened here.”

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

BAY VIEW, Skagit County — On a cloudy Friday morning, a group of volunteers huddled on the shore of the Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, peering over Angelica Lucchetto’s shoulder at an array of shed crab exoskeletons, called molts.
“You can tell this is a green crab because it has five marginal teeth,” explained Lucchetto, an invasive species specialist at the Reserve, pointing out the spikes along the front of a spotted greenish molt.
At that same time, similar groups gathered across the Salish Sea as part of a “Molt Blitz” to see if they could find any molts belonging to the invasive European green crab.

Though invasive crabs are a concern to ecosystems across Puget Sound, Padilla Bay must protect something extra special: 8,000 acres of eelgrass.
A powerful meadow 

	
Eelgrass might not seem like a top priority — it certainly doesn’t look like one. At low tide, when Padilla Bay turns into a muddy expanse, the soggy eelgrass is left strewn across the ground like forgotten party ribbons.
But Jude Apple, the research coordinator at Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, insists that the eelgrass meadow, which is the second largest on North America’s Pacific Coast, is worth protecting.
“It’s habitat for all the commercial organisms that we’re interested in … juvenile Dungeness crabs, herring, salmon — all kinds of organisms use the eelgrass as a home or as a nursery,” Apple said.

Many of those organisms are also “culturally significant species and first foods,” according to Sophia Ammons, a GIS program manager for the Samish Indian Nation’s Department of Natural Resources.
“It’s really important that we have that habitat so we can continually protect the species that are important for Samish and other coastal tribes,” Ammons said.
Eelgrass also has other superpowers. It keeps the sediment on the Bay’s floor in place, which reduces erosion of the shoreline and lowers flood risk. Studies show that landscapes like Padilla Bay also capture and store a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — more than a forest the same size could. That helps slow the rate of climate change and keeps the ocean’s water from turning too acidic, which harms organisms like shellfish.
One 2024 study even found that eelgrass could clean up pathogens that would otherwise end up in seafood. Though they aren’t sure how it works, the authors of that study found that mussels living near eelgrass contain up to 65% less harmful bacteria than mussels far from eelgrass, suggesting eelgrass could be used as a tool to ensure food safety and security.
Threats to eelgrass 
Padilla Bay’s eelgrass is going to get harder to protect, as rising ocean temperatures will make it harder for eelgrass to survive and facilitate the spread of fatal eelgrass wasting disease. If European green crabs become common, they’ll put even more pressure on the already threatened ecosystem. The crabs tend to uproot the eelgrass as they dig for sea worms or shellfish in the silt, and sometimes even gobble up the eelgrass itself.

“It’s not a threat yet, but there’s potential as the population increases,” Apple explained. “That’s why we’re doing a lot of trapping to prevent green crab populations from getting established.”
On Washington’s outer coast, established populations of European green crabs now dominate some coastlines. In 2024, more than 1 million European green crabs were caught between Willapa Bay and Gray’s Harbor alone.
Laura Kraft, a Washington State University researcher working in Willapa Bay, hopes that biologists around Puget Sound can keep invasive crabs out of precious sites like Padilla Bay. The urgency of that goal became even clearer in May, when a study Kraft worked on found that even young European green crabs could be a big threat.
Kraft’s team observed that juveniles are just as capable as adults of breaking open many species of clams and oysters to eat. Plus, they’re menaces around eelgrass.

“Not only were European green crabs feeding on eelgrass, but they were also just arbitrarily clipping it,” Kraft said, “and when the leaf is gone from the plant, it’s no longer able to grow.”
Kraft’s team conducted the study to try and figure out which species are the most important to protect now that it’s likely too late to get rid of European green crabs on the outer coast. But the reality of it being too late was hard for Kraft to come to terms with.
“I almost want to pause and grieve that for a moment,” Kraft shared. “It’s very frustrating to not have a better solution.”
Puget Sound is more protected than the outer coast — with shallower waters and only one way in and out — so it took some time before the European green crabs wound up here. The first one was spotted in the Sound in 2016. But the numbers have only gone up since then: In 2023, only a few dozen green crabs were found in Puget Sound; in 2024, that number shot up to more than 200.
A Salish Sea-wide effort
Padilla Bay — let alone Puget Sound — is massive. That’s why Washington Sea Grant, the organization that coordinated the Molt Blitz, created a way for citizens to help with monitoring efforts.

The blitz was not the only opportunity to contribute to invasive crab monitoring efforts; any Puget Sound resident can help collect data for the Molt Search program, any time of year.
At the end of their search on Friday, volunteers circled back together to sort the crab shells they found by species, counting up how many of each kind they had. Their piles only contained the multicolored molts of familiar native crabs — no European green crab molts in sight.
“That’s what we like to see,” Lucchetto said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Is it possible that the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were greatly exaggerated? 
The post Offshore wind is alive and well. Maybe we should just keep quiet about that.  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IS IT POSSIBLE that the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were greatly exaggerated? 
While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities were cheering on the impending death of offshore wind power a funny thing happened: Turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction. 
Candidate Donald Trump vowed that, if he were elected, the offshore wind industry would end on “day one” of his second term, and his Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Environmental Protection Agency immediately began the process of pulling approvals and denying permits on projects up and down the East Coast. 
Some projects did fold in the face of poor approval prospects and investor departures – but the industry is quietly completing massive projects that will supply power to millions of homes. 
Dominion Energy continues to work toward completing the nation’s largest offshore wind project in the waters off Virginia after battling years of fossil-fuel funded opposition and weathering the Trump administration’s repeated – albeit inconsistent — moves to shut down wind. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete about 30 miles from Virginia Beach.  In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail.  
With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs and stands as proof that offshore wind is alive and well. 
So while the naysayers were busy writing obituaries, offshore wind continued to do what it was always meant to do: generate power, create jobs, and help secure a livable future. 
Meanwhile, the most audacious attack on offshore wind, a stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind, was rescinded earlier this month. That project, 20 miles southeast of Long Island, is now back under construction.  
Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power half a million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition. Meanwhile, construction of the critical clean energy that New York actually needs proceeds in the form of Empire Wind. 
Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But at least for now, the project has been safe from Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support. 
Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.  
After a devastating turbine break stopped construction last July, Vineyard Wind has quietly – very quietly – managed to get back to work on its 806-megawatt project 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard. The project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is now generating electricity from 10 of 62 planned turbines. 
Each of these projects has – so far – survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations, and transmission cables; phony “grassroots” organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy – all so far have failed. 
Silence about success and ongoing work seems to be a part of the strategy for offshore wind developers – and maybe you can’t blame them. 
In May, one of the directors of the Dominion project said that continued construction came from “keeping our head down” and keeping the project away from any fanfare. Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green, or planet saving – which, of course, it is – but simply as homegrown American power. 
Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations. 
They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe – the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean. 
Jobs, measurable economic impact, and the promise of reliable domestic power – these may be keeping offshore wind on track to survive the current headwinds and thrive when the coast is clear. But for now, just don’t say out loud that it could also help protect our health and save the planet.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)WATERTOWN — It’s a simple life that seemed impossible two years ago. Now it could be in jeopardy. 
In the South Dakota home of displaced Ukrainians Ilona and Valerii Biliaze, sun shines through gauzy curtains as their 7-month-old baby naps below a window. Their 16-year-old son scrolls Instagram in his room after school, and their 12-year-old daughter lounges on her bed, sandwiched between school friends while gossiping.
Valerii is a self-employed contractor. Ilona stays home, watching their infant son when the kids are at school.
A town saved a nonprofit office to help laid-off immigrant workers find jobs. Now it’s all in peril.

Two years ago, they were refugees in France struggling to find work and make a living. They fled their home of Mariupol — one of the first cities Russia attacked in Ukraine — five weeks after the war broke out.
When the invasion began in 2022, electricity and heat were cut off as shelling became a constant background noise. Their children slept in a closet, never allowed to leave or approach the windows. They found shelter in a relative’s apartment after their own apartment building was razed by tank fire. 
Valerii passed dead bodies — neighbors, friends, strangers — as he sought food and water for their family. He risked his life each time he stepped outside their door, while snipers aimed at him and others as they collected water near the seaside.
They escaped all that and found a new home in South Dakota. But by Aug. 17, the life they’ve built could be gone.

The Biliazes are among 117,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States through the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program after fleeing the Russian invasion.
The effort is known as a humanitarian parole program. It’s carried out under the U.S. Homeland Security secretary’s authority to allow noncitizens into the country with a sponsor on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons.
Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota — the state’s designated refugee resettlement agency — has welcomed 484 Ukrainians to the state since the U4U program started in 2022. The nonprofit additionally worked on parole cases involving 90 Haitians and 169 Cubans in federal fiscal year 2024. There may also be legally admitted Ukrainians, Cubans and Haitians in South Dakota who haven’t opted to work with LSS.
The Trump administration and its Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — the former governor of South Dakota — have terminated the humanitarian parole status of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, among other sweeping changes to immigration policy and enforcement. 
The administration has not terminated the status of U4U participants, but has paused new applications to the program, including extension requests. The Department of Homeland Security erroneously sent emails to U4U participants in April saying their protected status was revoked. Although the emails were sent in error, they stoked fears that an actual revocation could follow.

Congress has not offered a pathway to legal permanent residency for Ukrainian parolees. When the Biliazes hit their two-year anniversary of arriving in Watertown in August, their parole will expire. They were denied in April for asylum — another form of legal residency for people with a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country. Their options include returning to war-torn Ukraine, seeking refuge in a new country or waiting as they appeal their asylum case.
The Biliazes do not know where they will go. If they return to Ukraine, Valerii and their oldest son might have to fight in the war they worked so hard to escape. They already sought refuge in France, but were not able to secure work and were moved every three months within the country.










We don’t have a plan. We don’t even want to think about starting over again.


– Ilona Biliaze


The couple have been taking English classes in the U.S., anticipating they would make Watertown their permanent home. Humanitarian parole, before this administration, could be extended for decades on a case-by-case basis. Humanitarian parole in the U.S. began in 1956.
The Biliazes’ daughter is nearly fluent in English. Their youngest child is an American-born citizen.
“We don’t have a plan,” Ilona told South Dakota Searchlight through a translator. “We don’t even want to think about starting over again.”
Taxes, work and school: ‘They’re contributing’
Susan and Bruce Buhler sweep into the Biliaze house with full-bodied hugs. Susan lifts the baby from his mother’s arms, doting on him and urging him to say “Babushka” or grandmother. She’s been studying Russian to more easily communicate with the family.
The two retirees live a few blocks away, and they serve as the family’s main sponsor. Their basement was the Biliazes’ home for 10 months after they arrived in the United States.
“We had space,” Bruce said. “They were people in need and we felt terrible about families being displaced.”

Ilona filled out an application online for the U4U program while they were in France and posted a profile of their family, hoping to find a required American sponsor to help pay the family’s way to the country, secure jobs and fill out paperwork. Bruce helped Valerii secure construction work within three days of living in Watertown. The couple also taught them how to drive in South Dakota.
Eight families from the Buhlers’ church pooled funds to sponsor a family after Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Bruce and Susan selected the family off a website “like a dating site,” based on their family photo and a resume, Susan recalled. 
The two families spent most summer nights visiting and playing games on the Buhlers’ screened-in backyard deck. Once Ilona and Valerii found out they were expecting, they rented their own house.
Valerii and Ilona own two vehicles. They bought furniture for their new home. Valerii paid thousands in federal taxes this year. They named their son Brian — the most American name they could think of.
“An All-American name for an American boy,” Valerii said in English, smiling proudly.

Bruce chafes when he thinks about the family being forced out of the country.
“It just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “They’re living their lives, paying taxes, contributing. They’re here legally. Anyone I bring it up to would tell you it’s crazy.”
Bruce said there are about a dozen other Ukrainian families living in Watertown on humanitarian parole. More families followed in the months after the Biliazes arrived, moving to Watertown under other sponsor families.
Two of the families left the country before the end of their parole, hoping to find refuge in European countries.
“They’re kicking people out who are good and hardworking,” Bruce said. “We need as many people in the workforce as we can get.”
Uncertainty creates anxiety within Ukrainian, Haitian communities
Ilona and Valerii applied for asylum in August last year, hoping it would offer a new avenue to citizenship or stall their impending deportation if the Ukrainian humanitarian parole program wasn’t renewed. Fleeing a war does not necessarily justify asylum. The status is based on persecution of a person’s race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group membership in their home country, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The Biliazes received a rejection in April, and their attorney wrote a 19-page rebuttal. They are waiting for a determination on their appeal, but they don’t have much hope.
Since they applied for asylum, though, they were approved for a new work permit authorizing Ilona and their daughter to potentially live and work in the United States through June 2030, as long as their asylum case remains pending. The family is waiting to hear if they’ve been approved work permits for Valerii and their oldest son.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Those permits could keep them in the country past August, if the case isn’t decided before then. The average processing time for asylum is five years, said Lutheran Social Service State Refugee Coordinator Dana Boraas. The Trump administration hopes to speed the process up.
If the asylum office doesn’t make a decision on the family’s appeal before their August deportation date, or decides to reject it, it’ll be forwarded to an immigration court. There, the Biliazes will be placed in deportation proceedings, where they’ll have another chance to have asylum decided by a judge.
Bruce Blumer, founder of Haiti Alive, sponsors a Haitian family living in South Dakota. The family of four are in the country under humanitarian parole, Blumer said, but they have “gnawing anxiety” after their work permits were terminated. They have until August before they have to leave the country.










The part that really disturbs me is that these people did exactly what this administration says they should do. They went through immigration, they filed and came here legally to our country.


– Bruce Blumer


The Federal Aviation Administration has extended its ban on U.S. flights to Haiti’s capital until Sept. 8, citing security risks from armed gangs.
“You’re sending these people back into dangerous, difficult and probably life threatening situations,” Blumer said.
Fortunately, Blumer said, Canada is accepting Haitians. The family he sponsors has been able to secure Canadian visas and plans to relocate there, he said, instead of returning to Haiti.
Ending the United States humanitarian parole programs is “nothing short of vindictive,” Blumer added.
“The part that really disturbs me is that these people did exactly what this administration says they should do,” Blumer said. “They went through immigration, they filed and came here legally to our country. They had an added step of having a sponsor to willingly contribute financially and vouch for these families.”
The Buhlers have sought help from South Dakota’s congressional delegates, but they have only received “generic responses” back. They don’t know where else to turn.
The Biliazes hope something will change.
“We’re still hoping we get to stay,” Ilona said. “This is our home.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota community rallied to keep a local nonprofit office serving immigrants and refugees in the area open earlier this year. But now those neighbors face uncertainty as federal policy changes force them out of the workforce and potentially out of the country. And the nonprofit is struggling with an uncertain future as federal funding and policy changes impair the organization. 
Sioux Falls-based Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota announced it would close its Yankton office in March due to a loss of federal funding. More than $50,000 fundraised by the Yankton community since then will help keep that LSS office open for at least another year.
‘This is our home’: Ukrainians settled in SD fear Trump-Noem policies will force them to leave

President Donald Trump cut funding used to help new refugees adjust to life in the United States through organizations like LSS, which resettles refugees on behalf of the federal government.
The nonprofit eliminated 13 positions due to the loss and absorbed hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses to provide resettlement services to those who arrived in America in the months before Trump assumed office, said CEO Rebecca Kiesow-Knudsen. The nonprofit also provides adoption, foster care, juvenile justice and behavioral health services to South Dakotans beyond its resettlement services.
She anticipates more funding cuts in the coming months. The changes are part of a “systematic dismantling of resettlement in the U.S.,” Kiesow-Knudsen said.
“What we’re feeling is we’re not going to see any substantive refugee resettlement in South Dakota in the near future.” 
Yankton population increases supported by immigration growth
Lutheran Social Services opened the Yankton office in 2022 to meet the needs of the area’s growing immigrant population.
The number of people identifying as Hispanic or Latino doubled in Yankton County between 2010 and 2020. The county’s overall population increased by about 872 people during the same period, according to Census data. Its Hispanic and Latino population alone increased by 620.
Driving much of that increase in Hispanic and Latino populations was a wave of Cuban immigrants moving to the area, Kiesow-Knudsen said. Many Cubans are living and working in the community legally through humanitarian parole, which is a temporary immigration status for individuals to live and work under a sponsor in the United States because they face a humanitarian crisis in their home country.
Lutheran Social Services worked with 143 Cuban humanitarian parole cases, or 169 people, in federal fiscal year 2024. There may be additional humanitarian parolees in South Dakota who haven’t contacted LSS for help, according to the nonprofit. 
The Yankton LSS office closure announcement coincided with the March closing of Cimpl’s Meats, a major employer in Yankton, which laid off more than 250 employees in March, many of whom were Cuban humanitarian parolees.

Those immigrants relied on Lutheran Social Services to find reemployment, said Rita Nelson, who formerly worked on workforce development at Yankton Thrive and sits on the Connecting Cultures Yankton board, which is affiliated with the economic development organization. The Yankton LSS office offers legal services, community orientation, health care navigation and job-seeking services. The state Department of Labor and Regulation also hosted a job fair to help workers apply for employment.
Immigrants in Yankton provide a sense of vibrancy and economic stability needed in the community, Nelson said. People moving in and starting families — whether foreign-born or not — work, live and spend money to support their families and area businesses.
“We all want individuals to be able to navigate the immigration process legally,” Nelson said, “and they can’t do that without a resource and someone who can help them.”
That feeling motivated Nelson and others to start a fundraising effort in April to keep the local LSS office open. Muddy Mo’s Coffee House owners posted about the fundraiser on social media and set a tip jar on the counter labeled “Help Your Neighbors.” The shop is owned by Katie Hunhoff, owner of South Dakota Magazine and daughter of the magazine’s founder and former state lawmaker Bernie Hunhoff.

The support reminded Bernie of times when farmers get sick or injured and neighbors rush to harvest the corn or bale the hay. It was an opportunity for people whose “hearts are with the Cimpl’s workers” to help.
Clients who use the LSS office were notified when it intended to close. They were also notified when their neighbors stepped in to keep the office open “because the community cares about them,” Hunhoff said.
“I think what happened in Yankton is powerful evidence this is where our community wants to go: We want to be good neighbors to everybody, and America is better as a welcoming place,” Hunhoff said.
Uncertainty for immigrants remains after community saves LSS office
Weeks after the community raised thousands of dollars to help their neighbors find reemployment through LSS, many of those same workers have been laid off again.
This time it was because the Supreme Court at the end of May upheld the Trump administration’s revocation of the Biden-era Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela parole program and elimination of the legal status of over 500,000 immigrants.
Cuban parolees are able to apply for U.S. citizenship through the Cuban Adjustment Act. While that pathway to citizenship is still open, said LSS State Refugee Coordinator Dana Boraas, the work permits of immigrants in the program were terminated. Several were laid off because “their work permits aren’t valid in the system anymore even if they expire next year,” she said.

The nonprofit is working with about 500 people affected by the terminated work permits statewide, to direct them toward legal services.
“A lot of people, unless they talk to an attorney, think they have no options to stay, they can’t file, and they have to leave,” Boraas said. “They get this scary notice saying, ‘You have to go home.’ We keep saying, ‘Talk to an attorney, talk to an attorney.’”
Yankton will be hurt if dozens of local immigrant families are forced out of the country, Hunhoff said.
“Of course, life will go on in Yankton and the other communities, but it’s a loss — not just economically but more so in terms of decency and fairness — and it’s contrary to everything we always believed about small town America,” Hunhoff said. “Maybe we aren’t the beacon of hope and morality we’ve always thought we were? That’s being tested.”
LSS faces more federal funding cuts
The Yankton community’s work to help its neighbors and the nonprofit is a “bright spot” for Lutheran Social Services, Kiesow-Knudsen said. But the organization’s funding troubles persist.
The nonprofit incurred about a half-million dollars in costs after the changes to immigration policy at the federal level, Kiesow-Knudsen said. Much of it was reimbursed by the federal government, after U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., argued that those funds were committed before Trump’s immigration overhaul. About $100,000 in expenses remain, Kiesow-Knudsen said.
The nonprofit continued to provide resettlement services for refugees who arrived in the United States within a few months of President Trump’s inauguration.
“It didn’t seem ethical to us to cut those people off,” Kiesow-Knudsen said. “It’s a story as old as our country. We welcome people.”
The nonprofit will have to cover the costs with funds from its foundation if the remainder is not reimbursed by the end of June.

The nonprofit is also working to understand what its role will be in the new federal fiscal year. As of October, Lutheran Social Services will no longer receive federal support for refugee resettlement directly from the federal government, under Trump’s new immigration policy.
South Dakota is one of 14 “replacement designee” states for refugee resettlement, meaning the funding goes directly to a nonprofit agency — such as LSS — rather than through the state. LSS has been the exclusive provider of refugee resettlement services in South Dakota for 25 years.
Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration will have to decide if South Dakota state government will take on its refugee program internally, like North Dakota or Minnesota; or contract the work out to another agency, in which case LSS could potentially be selected again; or decide not to accept any refugees. Wyoming is the only state that does not accept refugees.
LSS also lost a grant to help refugees find employment faster and a nearly $300,000 Department of Homeland Security grant used to provide education and legal assistance for immigrants working to become citizens. The legal services formerly cost $50 and classes were free. Now, legal services and classes cost $800 for anyone seeking citizenship. 
“That’s our breakeven cost to be able to pay the staff,” Boraas said.
The nonprofit is also facing additional cuts proposed in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” under consideration in the U.S. Senate, that would eliminate funding for adult education and to help refugees who are in the United States for less than five years.
“I feel comfortable that we can provide services through September 2026, and then we’ll see based on what happens in Congress,” Kiesow-Knudsen said.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.

Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.

Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.

Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help to shore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.

Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

We need Phil Scott to oppose the cruelty of the administration in Washington in the strongest possible terms.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Larry Satcowitz: Gov. Phil Scott, we’ve never needed you more. Where are you?.","This commentary is by Larry Satcowitz of Randolph. He is a Democrat representing the Orange-Washington-Addison District in the Vermont House of Representatives, and the ranking member of the House Environment Committee.


I was scheduled to be the final speaker at the “No Kings” rally in Burlington last week. Unfortunately, the event ran longer than anticipated, and I was not able to address the crowd. Here’s what I had planned to say: 
Good afternoon. My name is Larry Satcowitz. I’m a state representative from Randolph.
In these terrible and deeply disturbing times, it is a great joy to see you all today. Your presence gives me hope that we are a part of a large and growing resistance movement. Your presence gives me hope that we will thwart the billionaires and fascists that are currently in control of our federal government. 
We heard many wonderful speakers today. One person, however, was notably absent: Our governor, Republican, Phil Scott.
The Democratic Party is united in its opposition to Donald Trump. Every time a Democrat, like me, stands up, exactly no one is surprised. But opposition to Trump should not be a partisan issue. The president is destroying our democracy. He is destroying our economy. He is actively undermining our national security and the rule of law. These should not be partisan issues. 
A Republican governor who spoke out loudly, boldly and vigorously against the travesty taking place in Washington would do so with a special kind of authority. I remind you that Donald Trump and Phil Scott are on the same team.
I and others have recently published commentaries that ran in outlets all over the state, calling on our governor to speak out forcefully against the horrors that we are protesting here today. Days later Phil Scott issued a statement saying, “We must not allow ourselves to be distracted or live in a constant state of fear, anger or outrage.”
I can tell you that I have been terribly distracted since Jan. 20, I’ve been afraid for my country ever since that date. I am angry every single time I read the news. This is our reality, and we must face it.
Phil Scott called what’s going on “national rhetoric.”
He further wrote: “To move the Nation past the chaos Washington is causing, we need to rise above it and lead by example.” 
We do need to lead by example. The leaders who have preceded me on stage here today have done just that. If we followed our governor’s lead, we would not be here today at all.
There are Republicans who are opposed to what the president is doing. I believe Phil Scott is one of them. Imagine if he, as governor, took a clear, moral stand against the wrongdoings of the Trump administration. Imagine his leadership inspiring other Republican governors to stand up and do the same. Imagine the difference that would make for our country.
We need Phil Scott to oppose the cruelty of the administration in Washington in the strongest possible terms. We need him to oppose its recklessness in the strongest possible terms. We need him to oppose its outrageous corruption in the strongest possible terms.
Phil Scott frequently reminds us about how he is the governor of all Vermonters. All of us. Well, Phil, at this moment, we need you. We’ve never needed you more. Where are you? Why aren’t you here, with us, right now?

But with net population decline projected by 2050 and sub-par educational outcomes among Michigan children, we need to be serious about creating a state where kids can get ahead. Immigrant families are critical to our state reaching its full potential. 
In the past decade, immigrants have accounted for nearly 60% of the state’s population growth, while contributing billions in state revenue and economic activity. Yet a new swath of regulations, largely aimed to deter immigration, could do irreparable harm to many of our state’s youngest and most vulnerable residents.
In recent years, a surge of Unaccompanied Children (UCs) has crossed the southern border, entering Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody. These minors flee extreme circumstances where migration becomes an option of last resort. Michigan nonprofits serve children who made deadly journeys to earn money for their mothers’ cancer treatments or escape coercive recruitment into criminal enterprises.

The Trump administration has characterized these vulnerable children — 67% of whom are aged 16 or younger — as a national security threat, directing ICE to specifically target them for deportation. A multi-agency review of 450,000 unaccompanied minors is underway, enabled by revoking the DHS sensitive locations policy that previously protected schools, churches and hospitals from immigration raids.
In February, ICE began conducting “wellness checks” on immigrant children at schools — what the Young Center calls “a pretext to locate, interrogate and deport children and families.” A new plan proposes mobilizing 21,000 National Guard troops to round up UCs.
The administration also targets children by attacking the adults they rely on. After arrival, UCs transfer to ORR custody for shelter and basic necessities. Most unaccompanied children are then released to the custody of a sponsor, usually a close family member, until their legal status is adjudicated. However, new policy changes enable ICE to obtain the legal status of sponsors from ORR, putting undocumented sponsors at deportation risk.
Central to this campaign is terminating the Flores Settlement Agreement — the backbone of child protections requiring the provision of food, water, clean clothing and medical care in government custody. While courts have historically upheld the Flores Settlement Agreement, successfully overturning it would enable indefinite detention of children in prison-like conditions.
Already, new Trump administration rules requiring stringent sponsor identification verification now keep children in shelters an average 217 days before family release — up dramatically from previous timelines.
On top of this, a proposed budget reconciliation fine could charge sponsors up to $8,500 per child, while other provisions impose $1,000 asylum application fees and $500 Special Immigrant Visa fees — visas UCs often need when aging out at 18. These barriers create pay-to-play systems, effectively holding children ransom from families.
Funding cuts are eliminating vital services. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC), the state’s primary legal provider for unaccompanied minors, supporting 800 children, faced a March stop-work order cutting legal funding and forcing 72 layoffs. This leaves young children — including toddlers — to navigate the U.S. legal system alone.
Budget reconciliation threatens additional vital benefits for children. The proposed Child Tax Credit changes would require both parents to have Social Security numbers to qualify, potentially denying the $2,000 credit to 4.5 million American citizen children under age 17 based solely on their parents’ immigration status. Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could affect 400,000 legal refugees and asylum recipients, while broader benefit reductions threaten extended family support systems that children depend upon.
When parents face deportation or detention, children experience toxic stress, which impairs brain development and increases risks of chronic mental health conditions, including depression and PTSD, plus physical conditions like cancer, stroke, diabetes and heart disease. Research shows most children experience at least four adverse behavioral changes following immigration-related parental arrests — such as chronic fear and disrupted eating and sleeping patterns.
These trauma responses directly undermine educational achievement and workforce preparation at a time when immigrants account for nearly 60% of Michigan’s population growth over the past decade.
The cumulative effect could devastate Michigan families. With 300,000 Michigan children living in immigrant families — including 70,000 high schoolers representing 15% of the state’s high school population — Michigan’s economic future depends on these families’ stability.
Michigan teachers and superintendents already report declining attendance among immigrant children, imperiling long-term development while families rush to create guardianships fearing deportations. By destabilizing families representing such a significant portion of Michigan’s emerging workforce, these enforcement policies risk creating a traumatized generation while threatening the state’s economic growth and development goals.
The Michigan League for Public Policy and our partners are working to make sure all kids have a chance to grow up strong and healthy in our state. We can’t risk Michigan’s future, or the lives of thousands of innocent kids who are looking for opportunity and family reunification, with shortsighted and harmful restrictions like these.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/asylum-seeker.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-29 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Cindy Hyde-Smith hopes 2026 will be her first easy U.S. Senate campaign,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/29/cindy-hyde-smith-2026-hopes/,"Column: So far, Cindy Hyde-Smith's campaigns for U.S. Senate have not been easy in any way. Will her reelection bid in 2026 be any different?","The recent announcement that state Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner Andy Gipson plans to run for governor has fueled speculation about who will be running for what office in a wide open 2027 Mississippi election cycle.
Will all or any of the combination of Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, Auditor Shad White, Attorney General Lynn Fitch enter the gubernatorial donnybrook? Who will be the Democratic Party standard bearer, and will Democrats field competitive candidates for any of the other down-ticket statewide offices that could be vacant based on who is running for governor?
Perhaps, most importantly, will billionaire businessman Thomas Duff of Hattiesburg enter the gubernatorial race after showing numerous signals that he intends to?
But before the 2027 elections roll around there will be another consequential statewide race in Mississippi: for the U.S. Senate in 2026.
Incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith will be running in her third U.S. Senate race, and she surely hopes it will be her first easy one. Her first race, a special election in 2018 after longtime Sen. Thad Cochran retired, was the closest non-party primary U.S. Senate race in modern Mississippi history. Hyde-Smith, running then as the interim appointment of former Gov. Phil Bryant, captured 53.6% of the vote compared to 46.4% for Espy in the special election held to fill out Cochran’s term.
Trent Lott’s first race for the U.S. Senate was almost as close in 1988, when he won 53.9% to 46.1% against 4th District U.S. Rep. Wayne Dowdy. And in a 2008 special election, Republican Roger Wicker, appointed by Gov. Haley Barbour to fill a vacancy left when Lott retired, garnered 55% to 45% by former Democratic Gov. Ronnie Musgrove.
But after those relatively close elections, both Lott in 1994 and Wicker in 2012 had easier second elections.
Lott captured 69% of the vote against former state Sen. Ken Harper of Vicksburg. Wicker, on the other hand, had a little tougher race against Albert Gore, winning 57% to 40.6%. Gore was little known and underfunded, but was in many ways an attractive candidate with a noteworthy resume. Interestingly, Gore, like Wicker, was a Pontotoc County native.
In Hyde-Smith’s second race, she again faced Espy in a rare Mississippi campaign when the Democrat raised more money than the Republican. It is practically unheard of in the South — and assuredly in Mississippi — for a Democrat to raise more campaign funds than an incumbent Republican senator. Espy did.
Still, Hyde-Smith, who remains Mississippi’s only woman elected to a federal office, won 54.1% to 44.1%, but the campaign was far from easy for her.
The trend for decades has been that once a U.S. Senate seat is won in Mississippi, the incumbent holds the post for a long time with minimal opposition.
Hyde-Smith is still looking for that minimal opposition race. Will 2026 be when Hyde-Smith finally has an easy path to victory like other incumbent Mississippi senators normally have in their reelection efforts?
Perhaps hoping to ensure that easier path, President Donald Trump already has endorsed Hyde-Smith for her 2026 campaign.
But Trump also endorsed her in 2018 and 2020. Those endorsements did not result in easy campaigns for Hyde-Smith. In both of those campaigns, Hyde-Smith underperformed Trump’s Mississippi results.
Democrats Ty Pinkins and Albert Littell, both of whom have military backgrounds, already have announced their candidacy for 2026. Speculation is that District Attorney Scott Colom of Columbus also will challenge Hyde-Smith. And on the Republican side, author Sarah Adlakha, a Gulf Coast resident who works in health care, also has announced her campaign.
Whether other candidates emerge remains to be seen. And whether Hyde-Smith can experience a less stressful 2026 also remains to be seen.
So far the campaigns have not been as easy for her as for other incumbent U.S. senators from Mississippi.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06203518/AP_20309179341434-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-29 08:01:48.549378

Vermont’s farmers are growing crops that better suit the state’s warmer and wetter climate — and branching into products that provide income even when traditional crops fail. 
Since 1900, annual temperatures in Vermont have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit and annual precipitation has increased by 21% over the same span, according to the state. The changes have forced agriculture to adapt in sometimes surprising ways.

Now that winters are milder, it has become commonplace for Vermont orchards to grow peaches. Nick Cowles owns Shelburne Orchards, and 35 years ago, he saw a bedraggled peach tree at a hardware store and bought it on a whim. Since then — especially in more recent years — peaches have become a lucrative addition to his business. 
Peach trees like rain, and so the increased precipitation in Vermont does not bother them. Historically, temperatures posed a problem for peach-growing.
“It takes around 15-17 degrees below zero in the winter to kill the bud, and it used to be that there would be a stretch in the winter that we would get those temperatures. I figured we would get a peach crop maybe every third year,” Cowles said.
Now, he said, “it’s rare that they freeze out.” 
Innovation is also making Vermont a more peach-friendly place. 
Farmers have used new technology to develop more cold-hardy peach varieties, Cowles said, and he now has trees that ripen at different times so that the picking lasts longer and brings in more customers. 
In Ferrisburgh, Erik Andrus has turned his hayfields into rice paddies. 
His Boundbrook Farm uses the rice-and-duck farming technique, a pesticide-free method in which ducklings are released into rice paddies. They control weeds and pests — and provide fertilizer. 
The farm mostly grows cold-tolerant rice varieties from Japan, which sits at a similar latitude to Vermont, but has recently started to grow loto rice from Italy. 
The farm once accidentally planted Koshihikari, a variety of Japanese rice poorly suited to the cold. It did eventually mature, but not until October, which Andrus said was “a little bit of a nailbiter.”
Floods and droughts appear to be striking Vermont more frequently, but the rice grown at Boundbrook Farm is fairly immune to both, Andrus said. 
The plants can be underwater for two days without being harmed, and the grains are protected by a husk that means they won’t be contaminated by pollution from floodwaters. Because the varieties can be planted in floodplains, they can get water even during droughts. 
Andrus said “flood-prone bottomlands” are the best places to create rice paddies. Vermont has many such areas, and rice could represent a path forward for farms impacted by flooding. 
He works as a consultant at Cornell University, where a team of researchers is studying rice-farming techniques in the Hudson Valley. They are also offering workshops and creating resources for farmers. 
But nothing like that exists in Vermont, and acquiring the tools, seeds and knowledge to create and manage a rice paddy without help is unrealistic for most farmers here. 
Andy Jones, the manager of Burlington’s Intervale Community Farm, said it has become easier to grow crops that like it warm: peppers, eggplants, melons, sweet potatoes. 
The member-owned farm has also seen increased yields of cold-weather spinach, lettuce and kale grown in unheated greenhouses in the winter. The flip side is that, for several weeks in the summer, the farm has had to stop growing some of those crops because it gets too hot. 
Precipitation is becoming more intense but also more inconsistent. An increase in dry periods means more irrigation is needed, and bigger rainstorms mean plants get wet and stay wet, leading to an increase in diseases, Jones said. 
Climate change has hit Intervale Community Farm particularly hard because the entire farm sits in the floodplains of the Winooski River.  
Jones said that they are used to floods, but “what’s been changing is the magnitude of the flooding.” Tropical Storm Irene and the flooding events of 2023 and 2024 devastated the Intervale area. In 2023, Jones estimates the farm lost 80% of its crops. 
In response, the farm is doing more succession cropping, or planting and harvesting the same crop multiple times. Its farmers plant crops that take little time to mature, so that if there is a flood, they have new ones ready quickly. 
The farm has been renting fields at another farm in Hinesburgh to plant slower-growing crops. It’s also moved a lot of crops into hoop houses and to higher elevations to keep them dry. 
In spite of the flooding, Jones believes the farm is there to stay. 
“The Intervale has been in agriculture for more than a thousand years, and that’s not going to change,” he said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 90% of American farms take in $250,000 or less per year, which usually doesn’t leave much profit. A failed crop can mean disaster for a small farm. 
For apple trees, thunderstorms pose a special danger, particularly ones that include hai. Cowles, from Shelburne Orchards, said that hail can “in five minutes just wipe out a whole year’s worth of work.” 
After losing 80% of his main crop, McIntosh apples, to a frost last year, he decided to buy crop insurance, which has provided some peace of mind. But that does little to address the increasingly unpredictable nature of farming. 
“You used to be able to think seven generations ahead, but right now, really if you can even make it through the next couple years it will be good,” he said. 
Many farmers are adapting to the uncertainty by diversifying their products. Since 2016, University of Vermont entomologist Margaret Skinner has been studying saffron farming in Vermont. The spice sells for $20-75 per gram, according to the state, and grows in or out of a greenhouse. 
It ripens later than most other crops, meaning farmers have more time to devote to saffron’s tedious harvest. 
Vermont’s warming is too subtle to impact saffron’s growth. And even if erratic weather makes harvests less consistent, saffron has an advantage: longevity. It lasts two or three years if dried properly, Skinner said, and farmers can count on it to bring in money when other crops fail. 
Vermont saffron is also appealing to customers because it is niche. As Skinner put it, “People are really into local cool crops.” 
The cool crop factor also applies to Boundbrook Farm’s rice. The farm sells to specialty retailers, restaurants and consumers who pre-order it from an email list.
Cowles said the novelty of fresh peaches in Vermont made them a coveted commodity, as is the experience of going to an orchard to pick them. Shelburne Orchards’ peaches are so popular that some customers sign up in advance for pick-your-own days to ensure the pickers don’t outnumber the peaches, Cowles said.
The orchard also distills its Dead Bird Brandy from those pears and apples. 
“We bottle it after nine years, and that’s income that comes in regardless of whether we have a failed crop or not,” Cowles said.

Area officials marched in the parade down Broadway including Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, State Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat, and a contingent of Metro Nashville Councilmembers. O’Connell and supporters wore shirts with the words, “Choose How You Love” — a play on the name of O’Connell’s transit program, “Choose How You Move.”
The festival portion of the event, held at Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, took a several-hour hiatus mid-afternoon as a thunderstorm spurred a “shelter in place” order.
This year’s event comes amid increased targeting of the LGBTQ+ community  by President Donald Trump. On Thursday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed the U.S.S. Harvey Milk — named for assassinated political leader, LGBTQ+ rights champion and Korean War Veteran — would be named the U.S.S. Oscar Peterson, a Medal of Honor winner who died in World War II. Among other anti-LGBTQ+ actions, Trump has also prohibited transgender people from serving in the military.
Pride was first celebrated in the aftermath of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, in which patrons of a New York bar and drag queens fought against police who had raided the Stonewall Inn because of its same-sex clientele. Nashville held its first Pride celebration in 1989.
The festival will also be held Sunday.

RED SPRINGS —Early one evening this April, Kim Overstreet had just turned off the stove when she heard a boom. The panel box in the kitchen swung open and fuses shot out of their holders, bouncing off the fridge.
Less than a block away, Debra Duncan’s robot vacuum bolted off its charging station toward her, trailed by a blue flame.
In a home across the street, a light bulb exploded near a teenage boy, showering him in glass shards. “It frightened him so severely that he believed he had been shot,” one of his parents later wrote to town officials. It was the third power surge at the property in six months, they said.
These homes were among roughly 40 in Red Springs, a Robeson County town of 3,000, that were damaged by power surges on April 7. Residents lost appliances collectively worth tens of thousands of dollars: televisions, stoves and microwaves, washers and dryers, refrigerators, coffeemakers, HVAC systems, dishwashers, generators. Even surge protectors could not handle the voltage coursing through the electrical systems.

Officials with the town of Red Springs, which owns and operates its electric utility, have refused to cover the damages. They attribute the surge to the severe storms passing through that afternoon.
“We are deeming these losses as the result of Acts of God and were beyond the town’s control,” Town Manager Shanelle Harris wrote in an announcement on the Red Springs website April 17. “The power surges were not the result of lack of maintenance to the utility system or negligence. Our system meets modern, acceptable standards and the poles are annually inspected.”
Yet public documents and interviews show the Red Springs electric system is in disrepair. There isn’t enough money to cover major improvements, according to financial documents, in part because the town has used proceeds from its electric fund to float other government operations.
Red Springs is one of roughly 70 municipalities statewide that own and operate their own utilities. The town buys power from Duke Energy, but is responsible for the maintenance, improvements and operation of electrical lines, transformers and poles. It also sets rates and collects payments from customers.
Audits by the town’s accounting firm filed with the Local Government Commission, a division of the state treasurer’s office, reveal Red Springs routinely used customer payments deposited in the electric fund to fill gaps in the general fund, which covers day-to-day town operations, such as payroll.
State law allows municipalities to transfer those funds, but the amounts are capped, based on a percentage of the electric department’s gross annual revenues, or gross capital assets, for the previous year.
The state established those limits to “ensure electric funds are not being used to support municipalities’ general operations,” according to the town’s most recent audit.

In 2022 and 2023, the electric fund covered several months of health insurance premiums for some employees who did not work for the Electrical Department, including the town manager and the town clerk. The fund also covered a vacation payout for then-town manager David Ashburn when he retired in the spring of 2023.
“This practice has been stopped,” the town wrote to the Local Government Commission in response to the 2023 audit.
But a June 2024 audit showed Red Springs had transferred nearly $348,000 from the electric fund to plug holes in the general fund over the previous year. That amount was $101,000 more than the limit.
Since that audit, the town has reduced those transfer amounts well below the legal threshold, Red Springs’ Harris told Inside Climate News.
However, records show that even transfers within legal limits have significantly drained the electric fund.
The fund had an operating loss of more than $239,000 in fiscal year 2022, according to public documents. “This is largely due to the amount of subsidy provided to the General Fund, and inflation related to operating materials,” town officials wrote at the time.
In fiscal year 2021, electric capital reserves contributed $164,000 to the general fund; a second town account, the electric fund, transferred $176,000 to the water and sewer fund.
The storm and the power surges
Harris, who had been town manager for six months at the time of the April surges, wrote on the Red Springs website a storm with high winds caused electric lines to cross or “slap” at an intersection downtown.
A storm did pass through Red Springs that day. The first surge occurred at 2 p.m., and blew parts of Duncan’s meter base 10 feet, where they landed near an azalea bush.
Although the weather was calm, neighborhood residents said, a second surge occurred around 7 p.m., and destroyed their appliances.

Harris said the second surge happened when Duke Energy tripped a breaker at its substation. A Duke Energy spokesman told Inside Climate News that some of its Robeson County customers experienced storm-related outages at 2 p.m. and again at 7 p.m. after a tree fell on a line. He could not confirm whether a breaker had been tripped.
After the second surge, Overstreet said she called the town dispatch and told them she needed to speak to someone as soon as possible. Electric department workers then arrived at her home.
She and her husband noticed the wires leading from a pole to the top of the house had come loose.
“Every time we have an outage, it’s that transformer. They come out and fix it,” but the repairs don’t last, Overstreet said.
The Overstreets have experienced problems with the electrical system, and in one case, the town’s insurance covered it. In 2013, a voltage issue affected the fridge, Overstreet said. A receipt from that time shows the town paid $1,055 for “property damage.”
Harris also attributed the widespread damage to electrical problems within individual homes. When town staff replaced damaged meters, she wrote, “some customers were advised their homes had outdated meter bases that weren’t … properly grounded, old panel boxes or faulty wiring.”
Overstreet’s home was built in the 1940s, but she said her meter had been updated. Workers who came to the house after the surge did not go inside to check the wiring, she said, nor did they comment on the age of her meter.

The home next door that sustained three power surges was built in 2007. Duncan’s home is 42 years old, constructed in 1983. “I went through Hurricanes Fran, Matthew, and Florence, and nothing like this happened,” she said.
Property records show that with the exception of one historic home, the 15 damaged houses in east-central Red Springs were built between 1941 and 2019.
“We all had the same thing happen, no matter what year our homes were built or how good the wiring was,” Overstreet said. “We all had one thing in common: where we got our electricity.”
A former Red Springs employee told Inside Climate News that about half of the town’s transformers are capable of accommodating a higher voltage, but the rest are not. “It’s harder to get transformers for the lower voltage,” said the former employee, who asked not to be named because they still have connections to the town. “One of these days, it’s going to go down and not come back up.”


The former employee’s account matches comments Red Springs has provided to the Office of State Budget and Management. Two years ago, the town received a $1 million grant, half of which was supposed to cover electrical upgrades. To receive the funds, the town had to submit a scope of work document.
According to that document, “a much-needed electric utility upgrade is converting areas of town from 4 kVA power to 24 kVA power.”
A kilovolt-ampere, or kVA, is a unit of measurement that indicates the total energy supplied to an electrical system. When an energy load is unbalanced, equipment can overheat, fail, increase power consumption and degrade the overall performance of the system.
Red Springs would also “assess low-voltage areas and a full upgrade,” the town wrote, “and eliminate an obsolete substation and improve lines and infrastructure.”
The town received the grant in February 2025, according to an Office of State Budget and Management spokesperson, but has not yet reported any expenses.
The town’s electric fund is more solvent now because rate increases “provided significant revenues to the once-struggling fund,” according to a proposed town budget presented to the commissioners in early June. The budget calls for $210,000, within the legal limit, to be transferred to the general fund.
Earlier this month, Overstreet spoke before the town commissioners and told them the April 7 power surge could have been handled differently. “Even if you would have told us to give you a list of the things we lost, and to tell you what happened to us that day,” she said. “A little bit of respect and compassion goes a long way.”
The Overstreets did file a claim with their insurance company and received a small sum to replace the food in their burned-out refrigerator. A dryer also had to be replaced, but insurance did not cover that. Overstreet estimates the family has spent $5,000 out of pocket on new appliances and light fixtures.
“We pay the town, we entrust our safety to the town,” she said. “When I lay down at night, I used to feel reassured that they have my safety as their first interest. Now I don’t feel that at all.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Red-Springs-town-hall-Inside-Climate-News-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

Jeff Landry took more control over Louisiana's public defense system in 2024, chief public defender contracts have been irregular. (Getty Images)Last year, the attorneys who run local public defender offices noticed an unexpected clause in their annual state work contracts. It dictated the state public defender would have “sole authority” to increase their compensation “at any time for any reason.” 

The provision ran contrary to a law the Louisiana Legislature approved a few months earlier requiring the state public defender to set pay rates for lead local public defenders “according to a compensation plan established by the board,” that oversees the public defender system. 
State Public Defender Rémy Starns had asked the legislature to give him exclusive control over chief public defender pay in February 2024, but the lawmakers declined. Instead, they added the stipulation to state law that requires him to use the Public Defender Oversight Board’s pay guidelines. 
Some local public defenders believe Starns slipped the extra clause into their contracts – which started on July 1, 2024, and run through the end of this month – to give himself power the legislature wouldn’t. Three of the state’s 36 chief public defenders crossed out the language before signing their contracts and sending them back to Starns. 
In response, Starns did not sign those three contracts, though the three attorneys – Michelle AndrePont of Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson of Natchitoches Parish and Trisha Ward of Evangeline Parish – continued to work the past year as if they were in place. 
Their experience is indicative of a wider pattern of irregularities since Gov. Jeff Landry and lawmakers restructured the public defender system last year to give Starns more authority. The Louisiana Illuminator obtained and reviewed copies of the annual contracts of the 36 chief public defenders currently working through a public records request. 
Over the past three months, Starns has refused to answer calls, texts and written questions sent through a series of emails about this report. 
Public defender contracts are late, unsigned 
In all, Starns had not signed contracts for 10 attorneys running local public defender offices as of March, nine months into the 12-month term of their agreements. Five weren’t signed by either Starns or the applicable chief public defender, though the attorneys continued to oversee the local offices as if the agreements were in effect. 
Of the contracts Starns did sign, at least 20 were signed late. All but two of the contracts with 36 current chiefs had a start date of July 1, 2024, but Starns signed only four before that deadline. 
It’s unclear why so many contracts were not completed or signed before they took effect. The chief public defenders in question have not commented, with 21 either not responding to phone calls made to their offices or declining to talk to a reporter. 
People who have previously worked in Louisiana’s public defender system said it is unusual for so many employment agreements to not be completed by their start date. 
“As far as I recall, all the contracts were always signed,” said Jay Dixon, who served as Louisiana’s state public defender from 2013-19. “When I was there, there was never anybody whose contract was not renewed.”
For nearly two decades, a state public defender board was in charge of hiring chief public defenders and had to vote on their contracts. That all changed in 2024 when the governor and Starns successfully lobbied for the state public defender to have more control over those positions.

Starns now mostly controls the hiring of chief public defenders instead of the board. Louisiana’s sprawling public defense network includes 850 attorneys who represent 146,000 people annually, accounting for approximately 88% of criminal defendants in the state. 
Frank Neuner, a Lafayette corporate defense attorney who was chair of the state public defender board from 2008-13, was taken aback when told about the irregularities in the contracts under Starns’ watch. 
“That’s very abnormal,” said Neuner, who serves on the board for the Legal Services Corp., a legal aid nonprofit, as an appointee of President Donald Trump. “That’s your contract. That shows me poor administration.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Starns adds pay incentives without board approval
When hiring two new chief public defenders this year, Starns ignored the state public defender board’s pay scale he was supposed to follow. Instead, he used a compensation plan he asked the board to adopt three times in the last year but that board members rejected. 
The board compensation structure bases pay on a chief public defender’s experience as well as the size and complexity of the offices they run. For example, some oversee offices in more than one judicial district, and they would be compensated more under the board plan. 

Starns’ proposal, which the board has never agreed to use, relies more heavily on offering incentive pay to chief public defenders who personally try cases in court. It also encourages chiefs with smaller offices to run private law practices in addition to their public criminal defense work. 

In some cases, Starns’ compensation plan would cut the pay of individual chief public defenders by tens of thousands of dollars, which is a primary reason the board has declined to approve it. Starns has said he believes some current chief public defenders are paid too much. 

In August, Chris Bowman signed a contract Starns drafted to become chief public defender in Winn Parish. It stipulates Bowman will be paid $60,000 per year, with the potential to earn up to $75,000 as long as he personally represents clients in court. It doesn’t give a specific number of cases that Bowman must pick up, but it appears to allow Starns to decide if Bowman has done enough work to earn the salary boost. 

Bowman could not be reached at his office for comment about his contract. 
In November, Antonio Birotte signed a contract from Starns to become chief public defender of St. Landry Parish. His base salary is $84,000 per year, with the potential to earn up to $112,000 as long as Birotte personally represents defendants in murder cases as well as parents in juvenile court. 
As with Bowman, no specific number of cases is mentioned, presumably leaving it up to Starns to decide if Birotte has done enough work to receive his bonus pay. Birotte hasn’t responded to phone calls and messages left at his office. 
Public defender board members are angry with Starns for structuring contracts with his own compensation plan and not the one they have approved. They said Starns is breaking the law enacted just last year. 

“It’s our authority to approve a compensation plan,” member Adrejia Boutté told Starns at a board meeting earlier this month. “It’s still violating something that we’ve already passed.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
New contracts with more control for Starns

The contracts Starns has asked chief public defenders to sign for the fiscal year that starts Tuesday give him even more power over their compensation. 

They stipulate that Starns and the chief public defenders can terminate their contracts at any time for any reason with 30 days notice. The chief defenders also have to waive the right to appeal their termination to the public defender board and decline their right to use the board’s compensation plan. 
At the June board meeting, Starns said he would not agree to use the board’s compensation plan in any of the contracts. 

“I’m not going to have contracts that have those provisions in them,” he told the board members. 
“That’s why they were waived,” he added. 

Starns’ new stipulations appear to be in response to five chief public defenders who he is trying to oust that have challenged their dismissals. Earlier this month, a board committee recommended the full public defender board block Starns from firing the attorneys. Members are expected to vote on whether to try and stop the dismissals Monday. 
Starns is trying to dismiss AndrePont, Brunson and Ward – the three attorneys who struck language from their contracts that Starns wanted to include last year. He also wants to terminate Deirdre Fuller of Rapides Parish and John Hogue, who works in  East Carroll, Madison and Tensas parishes. 
The five attorneys have been the most vocal about opposing Starns’ policies since he first became state public defender in 2020 under former Gov. John Bel Edwards. They have pushed back on his proposed compensation plan several times in front of the board and state lawmakers. 

Starns said 30 chief public defenders have agreed to his additions to their contracts that give him more control over their pay and more ability to fire them without cause. 

Board member Frank Thaxton is skeptical, saying chiefs have only agreed to those conditions because they are afraid Starns will retaliate against them otherwise. A retired district court judge, Thaxton said some have contacted him personally asking for help. 

“The district defenders are afraid to even discuss this among themselves, due to a well grounded fear of immediate termination if their opinions get back to the state public defender. We have no protection at all other than the board,” Thaxton said, reading from an email sent from a chief public defender whose name wasn’t disclosed during this month’s board meeting. 
“The overwhelming mood is fear. I am even afraid to send this message,” Thaxton said, quoting the email further. 

Derwyn Bunton, Orleans Parish chief public defender from 2009-22, said the concessions Starns has inserted into the chiefs’ contracts for the upcoming year are substantially different from what was expected when he worked in Louisiana’s public defense system. 

Bunton is now the chief legal officer of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization that fights racism and other forms of discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system. 
“It is a level of interference that no district attorney would ever allow or tolerate,” Bunton said. “The idea was to have the public defender stand on equal footing with the district attorney … and this is certainly a departure from that.”
Starns’ overwhelming control over the chiefs’ jobs could also make it more difficult for the attorneys on the frontlines of the public defender system to do their jobs. The state public defender is appointed by the governor, whose political goals often run contrary to the mission of the public defense system. 
Defendants have a constitutional right to legal counsel when facing criminal charges, but that doesn’t make it a popular choice to represent people accused of heinous acts. 

In order to represent their clients adequately, public defenders often have to be insulated from powerful political groups, said Nathan Fennell, an expert on indigent defense with Southern Methodist University’s Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center in Dallas. 

“The more that a public defender has to worry about how to keep their job … then the bigger the structural problem is … and the more the client may suffer,” Fennell said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

A new state law that raises Mississippi’s gasoline tax by 3 cents a gallon and cuts the state grocery tax by 2% will take effect on Tuesday, along with other statutes the Legislature passed and governor signed into law earlier this year. 
Mississippi currently has a flat 18.4 cents a gallon excise tax on fuel, one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. The law will raise the tax to 21.5 cents a gallon this year, then increase it three cents a year until July 1, 2027. At completion, the state gas tax will be 27.4 cents a gallon, a 9-cent total increase. 
Proceeds from the tax will go toward building and maintaining state roads specified by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. 
Mississippi also has a 7% sales tax on non-prepared food, commonly called the grocery tax. The tax, the highest of its kind in the nation, will be reduced to 5% in July. Municipalities around the state receive a portion of this sales tax. The new law ensures cities will receive a larger diversion rate, and be “made whole” from the cut. 
“The decrease is part of House Bill 1 that passed during this year’s Regular Session of the Mississippi Legislature,” Revenue Commissioner Chris Graham said in a press release. “We are excited to be able to administer this reduction to help provide relief on the cost of groceries to Mississippi families.”

Sweeping Mississippi tax overhaul passed … by mistake. Gov. Reeves eager to sign typo tax swap into law

Mississippians will also see a reduction in the state income tax rate because state officials are still phasing in a 2022 law that is reducing the income tax to 4%. The Legislature this year passed a new law that will reduce the 4% tax rate in 2027 to 3% over four years. Starting in 2031, the remaining 3% tax will be eliminated over time, based on economic growth triggers. 
 In addition to the tax overhaul, other laws will also go into effect on July 1, including:
Direct wine shipment
A new law legalizes shipping some wines to Mississippians’ homes. Supporters pushed to allow direct wine shipment for over a decade before they succeeded this session. Mississippi was one of only a handful of states that didn’t allow direct shipment. 
Under the new law, shippers must obtain a permit from the Department of Revenue to ship wine, and they are capped at 12 nine-liter cases of wine annually to any one address. The measure also restricts citizens to ordering only certain specialty or rare wines that may not be available at Mississippi package stores. The law aims to generate taxes by enacting a 15.5% tax on direct wine shipments. Some of the tax revenue will fund mental health programs.
Kratom banned for people under 21
Mississippi will limit kratom purchases to people 21 and older and outlaw more potent forms of the herbal substance. The new law institutes fines for people under 21 who buy or possess kratom and retailers that sell it to them. The measure also bans synthetic kratom extracts, which are considered more dangerous than “pure” forms of the herbal substance because of their higher potency. 
More than thirty counties and cities in Mississippi already restrict or ban kratom products, which can be found widely in gas stations and tobacco or vape shops. Any ordinances that have been adopted by municipalities or counties to regulate or ban kratom will remain in effect. 
Rape kit mandate 
Mississippi hospitals will now be required to perform rape kits on sexual assault victims who come to their ERs. A new law mandates all hospitals stock rape kits, have a provider available to perform a rape kit, and that they do not turn rape victims away.

The legislation was inspired by several cases where survivors did not receive routine treatment at hospitals, according to sexual assault advocacy organizations. 
Turkey stamps 
Mississippi hunters must obtain a turkey stamp before harvesting the wild birds, a new state law requires. The measure requires in-state hunters to purchase a $10 turkey stamp and out-of-state hunters to pay a $100 fee for the stamp. In addition to the new stamp, the law still requires hunters to obtain a normal hunting license. 
Proponents of the measure said the stamp fees would be used to maintain and improve turkey-hunting lands around the state.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24151925/3X0A5170.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

To access, click on the player above.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon in a Hartford courtroom, a small crowd of about 20 people waited to be called before the judge.
Some fidgeted nervously. None of them had a lawyer of their own.
U.S. Immigration Judge Ted Doolittle called them forward, one by one, to the table facing him. An interpreter sat to his right, and an attorney from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was on a video monitor.
Those waiting their turn listened closely to the interpreter. 
“I am looking for a lawyer, but most either don’t answer or say that they are busy,” one woman told Doolittle. “I’ve looked for them, contacted a few, some didn’t answer and some didn’t want to take my case because they were working on other cases.” 
The lack of an affordable and available lawyer was the common thread that bound this group together. 
Immigration courts fall under the federal executive branch, not the judicial branch, like most courts. And immigration cases are civil, not criminal, meaning certain due process protections don’t apply — including the right to a court-appointed lawyer. 
Judge Doolittle gave each of the individuals before him a list of free and low-cost attorneys and emphasized the importance of having representation.
“[The lawyers] are often too busy to help everyone, and it can be hard to get in touch,” he told them. But the judge added that families with good attorneys win their cases more often. 
The judge warned the people in the room to be careful as they looked for an attorney. They shouldn’t give money to people they don’t know, he said.
As Doolittle dealt with each case, setting new court dates for most, the room gradually emptied.

CT’s shortage of immigration attorneys
It’s not unusual for immigrants to go through court without legal representation. But a Connecticut Mirror investigation found that Connecticut stands out for having one of the lower representation rates in the country — and that matters when someone is trying to avoid deportation. As Doolittle noted in court that day in June, people are far more likely to win their cases when they have a lawyer.
A shortage of judges and immigration court staff, a recent influx of migrants to the United States and the labor-intensive nature of cases have rendered it impossible for Connecticut’s small community of immigration lawyers to meet the demand for representation. 
As a result, tens of thousands of immigrants in Connecticut are left without legal support, even as stories of immigration enforcement grow more frequent, from a mother taken from her car in New Haven to men detained at a Southington car wash.
Every time I look at [the case backlog], it just keeps growing again.Sheila Hayre, Quinnipiac Law Professor, supervisor at Quinnipiac Civil Justice Clinic
Even attorneys who have worked on immigration cases, like Maggie Rodriguez, formerly a lawyer with Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS) in New Haven, don’t have much capacity to take on new clients with immigration cases.
“If you are taking on this case from start to finish, you’re signing up for a many-year-long representation,” she said. “Once your docket is full, it remains full for a long time.”
That’s true not only for Rodriguez but for most other immigration lawyers in Connecticut. IRIS and other aid organizations have gathered and distributed materials to help people understand their rights in immigration proceedings and when interacting with law enforcement.
“That is all that we’re really able to offer the immigrant community right now,” said Ellen Messali, an attorney with the legal aid organization New Haven Legal.
Immigrants in the U.S. illegally — those who entered without proper documentation or overstayed a visa — have the right to due process when authorities bring a case seeking to deport them. 
But the immigration courts that handle these cases are overloaded, facing a backlog that has grown for nearly two decades and ballooned in 2023 and 2024. At the end of last year, the number of pending cases nationwide was over 3.6 million. 
Immigration court backlog
In Connecticut, more than 42,000 cases were pending as of May, before just two judges. In fiscal year 2024 alone, more than 20,000 new cases were added to the docket. On average, cases in Connecticut take nearly 500 days to be resolved.
“Every time I look at that number, it just keeps growing again,” said Sheila Hayre, a clinical professor at Quinnipiac University School of Law and supervisor at Quinnipiac’s Civil Justice Clinic.
Lawyers say the legal process can be lengthy and unpredictable in immigration court, and outcomes can vary depending on which judge is hearing a case. The judges in Hartford’s Immigration Court, for example, denied nearly 70% of asylum cases from the 2019 through 2024 fiscal years, while the national average is below 60%, according to data gathered by the research group Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse and analyzed by CT Mirror.
Since many immigrants lack access to legal representation, it often falls to judges to explain the complexities of a defendant’s various legal options.
For example, in federal court that day in June, one man told Judge Doolittle that he had hired a lawyer, but they didn’t collect evidence. Another man told the judge he wanted to keep fighting his case but had already been defrauded by an attorney. Because the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was seeking to deport him quickly, both the judge and the government attorney suggested he find a new lawyer soon so the attorney would have time to prepare to fight deportation proceedings. 
“This is some good advice from the government attorney,” Doolittle said. “Don’t wait.”
Doolittle also took time to explain options to two single moms who didn’t have lawyers.
One young mother, whose daughter wore a pink dress, said she had tried three attorneys, but none would take her asylum case. The judge told her the next hearing would go forward with or without a lawyer and suggested she look into Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). She had never heard of the program before. 
But giving people extensive legal advice “is obviously not a good way for a judge to spend time,” Hayre said. In cases where a defendant’s son or daughter could be sent back to their home country, she said, judges know that an extra five minutes of explanation could end up being a matter of life or death for the child — given the threats some immigrants face back home.

“There’s nobody else to explain it,” Hayre said. “The whole thing is so frustrating.”
But even as immigration enforcement is ramping up, while case backlogs have grown across the country over the past five years, the federal government fired 20 immigration judges in February.
The number of immigration judges in Hartford recently dropped from three to two. There are concerns that immigration cases in Hartford will now take longer to process and may suffer in quality at a time when courts are already overwhelmed and expecting even more cases.
Dozens of members of Congress signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi expressing their concerns, including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District.
The importance of legal representation 
Hayre recalled the story of a Guatemalan woman she represented who was trapped in an abusive marriage. The woman, mother to two U.S. citizen teenagers, lived in constant fear.
The woman’s husband used her immigration status to threaten her safety if she looked for help. 
“I have status,” her husband would tell her, Hayre said. “You have no rights in this country because you are undocumented.” 
Hayre said she remembered how he would threaten his wife: “If you call the police, I will tell them lies about you, and they will listen to me because I am legal.”  
For people with very good cases where maybe their family is in danger in their home country, [the court delays are] really much more of a problem.Michael Boyle, immigration attorney
The woman’s husband told her if she tried to ask for custody or child support, the judge would give him custody and she would be deported.
Without access to an immigration attorney, many victims don’t realize they could qualify for protections under federal law. 
The woman was able to get legal status through a program under the Violence Against Women Act. Soon after, Hayre heard from her for the first time in four months. That was the first time that she spoke in English to Hayre.
“She told me that getting status gave her a new lease on life and a new connection to this country,” Hayre said. “Divorced from her abuser, she was now working two jobs, making more money than her husband, and her kids were excelling in school. One child was starting his military service.”
Immigrants facing removal proceedings are more likely to prevail in their cases if they are represented by a lawyer. Most do not have representation. 

While immigrants have the right to legal representation, they must pay for it themselves.
And  lawyers are hard to find.
In Connecticut, just over 26% of immigrants with pending cases are represented by a lawyer, TRAC data shows. And for those with newer cases, about 28% are represented. 
Compared to other states, Connecticut ranked 17th from the bottom for legal representation in immigration court cases as of May 2025.

That includes all cases that are still waiting for a decision in immigration court. Some cases may only need one hearing, while others can stretch over many years with multiple court dates, according to TRAC.
In some cases, it takes time to even be added to the court docket. Some people arrested at the border and released to pursue their cases end up stuck in limbo at the border. Their cases are not filed with an immigration court, sometimes for years. 
“For people with weak cases, that’s fantastic, because they often got work authorization, nobody’s going to bother them for years. So they’re picking up extra years here,” said Michael Boyle, an immigration attorney with offices in Danbury and New Haven. “For people with very good cases where maybe their family is in danger in their home country, it’s really much more of a problem.”
At the start of the process, many people don’t have lawyers. But as cases move forward, particularly closer to a final decision like an asylum ruling, people are more likely to find legal representation. That’s why early-stage cases tend to have lower representation rates.
Cases without lawyers are often resolved faster, according to TRAC, because “without representation, more often than not, no one is available with the knowledge and skills required to effectively mount a defense.” Over time, this leaves a growing share of the backlog made up of people who do have lawyers.
For example, in the 2025 fiscal year, 74% of pending cases involved people without a lawyer, while 26% were represented. In initial hearings, 91% of cases were unrepresented, but in later-stage hearings where decisions are made, 89% of people had lawyers, according to a CT Mirror analysis of TRAC data. 
It’s not clear exactly how many immigration lawyers are working in Connecticut. But if the total number of immigration lawyers in the U.S. were evenly distributed by population, it would be fair to estimate Connecticut has only about 200. And they’re expensive: Legal fees can range from $10,000 to $20,000 or more per case. 
With so few available, it isn’t possible for immigration lawyers to represent every client that seeks their help. 
“What if you’re a family fleeing Venezuela? How do you represent the whole family? So the lawyer is making a very hard decision of who has the strongest case,” Hayre said.
Representation and court outcomes
Representation plays a crucial role in deportation case outcomes. Among those granted relief, 97.5% were represented, while only 2.5% were not. Of those removed, only 26.8% were represented, while 73.1% were not.
But the growing backlog has placed mounting pressure on the entire immigration legal system, cutting down the time and resources available. So immigrants with stronger or less complicated cases often have an easier time finding representation — and a higher likelihood of winning their cases. 
“People in immigration court are having their absolute entire life decided in one to two hours,” Boyle said. “It used to be, up until a couple of years ago, it used to be you at least got three or four hours.”
Getting more time if front of a judge often requires pushing back, Boyle said. Otherwise, life-altering decisions are made in an incredibly short window without adequate time to build a detailed record and establish the applicant’s credibility, he said.
In Connecticut, in asylum cases from Fiscal Year 2001 through May 2025, more than 37% of asylum decisions — involving people who are seeking relief from deportation because of conditions in their home country — were granted on their merits when defendants had legal representation. In cases where the defendant didn’t have a lawyer, roughly 10% were granted asylum or other relief, according to a CT Mirror analysis of TRAC data. 
If an immigrant gets arrested and detained, representation becomes even more complicated. Some may find themselves no longer able to afford a lawyer because they’re unable to work. 
“You think that you know what you might be doing for a client to help them one day, and then, within a matter of days, that option that you thought you have may no longer even be available,” New Haven Legal’s Messali said.
Not everyone wants to work in situations where people are so traumatized.Ellen Messali, New Haven Legal
It also shifts the logistics of working a case, Messali said. Visiting clients in detention is an all-day commitment because there are no immigration detention centers in Connecticut. 
Some of New Haven Legal’s clients are in Plymouth, Mass. Others are in Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Clients have also been sent to facilities even further away, leaving them far from their contacts and their families.
“We’ve had clients get sent south to Georgia,” Messali said.
Securing bonds for detained immigrants can significantly improve their chances of success in immigration court, allowing them to be home with their families and properly prepare their cases, Messali said. When released on bond, their case returns to the court’s regular docket, giving them years to find legal representation and prepare their applications. But with so few lawyers available, it still leaves many scrambling.
Those who remain detained face an expedited process, having just weeks or months to prepare for removal proceedings. There often isn’t time to find legal representation. 
Remote hearings further complicate the process, with detainees appearing before a judge over a screen and relying on phone or video interpretation.
“While accessing clients who are detained out of state is very taxing and resource-intensive, we do not advocate for Connecticut to begin detaining immigrants in its correctional facilities,” Messali said. “We are opposed to immigration detention anywhere and want to see it abolished.”
Limited options
The supply of lawyers isn’t meeting demand because providing low-cost or free legal services to immigrants requires substantial funding, which “just kind of doesn’t exist” in Connecticut, Rodriguez said. That means fewer open positions for lawyers interested in representing immigrant clients in the state.
Back at the courtroom, one woman said she had spoken to three lawyers but was told that none had capacity to take on her case. Another woman had filed her petition for asylum with an attorney at a nonprofit who was later let go due to lack of funding at that organization. The woman was on two lists for legal aid services in New Haven and Bridgeport, but the clock was ticking on her case. She told Doolittle she’d looked into private defense but found it was unaffordable. 
“I understand that it’s hard, and there’s a lack of funding,” Doolittle told her. The judge granted several of the individuals before him an extra year to find an immigration attorney. 
People who want to practice immigration law are more likely to find jobs in Boston or New York, Rodriguez said. That leaves immigrants in Connecticut with limited options. The highest concentration of immigration cases in the state are in Bridgeport, Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and New Haven — which isn’t convenient for a lawyer licensed in Massachusetts or New York. 
And the work itself is hard. Beyond the legal complexities, the emotional toll can be profound, Messali said. 
“The work that my colleagues and I do is very trauma-intensive,” she said. “We work with people who have been persecuted, who have been tortured, who are terrified at the prospect of returning to their home countries. Not everyone wants to work in situations where people are so traumatized and [face] the additional challenges that come with working with individuals who have been through this kind of trauma.”
Despite the emotional toll, Hayre continues to pursue this line of work. Stories like the Guatemalan woman’s keep her going. 
“I do this because of people like her — immigrants who remind me of why this country is so great, because of people who come here seeking a better life, ready to work hard in order to ensure a better future for themselves and their children.”
Brian Galliani, dean of the Quinnipiac School of Law, said Connecticut might consider funding a “right to counsel” program for immigrants, similar to a service the state provides to defendants in eviction cases. 
Galliani pointed to the state of Oregon as an example, where immigrant legal representation is funded by the state through a nonprofit known as the Innovation Law Lab. That organization also partners with law school graduates who can earn a license by completing a certain number of hours of supervised legal service to clients. He said that the same model could work in Connecticut.
Quinnipiac’s Hayre said while having a lawyer is ideal, expanding legal education and courtroom support for immigrants could make a big difference — by helping them navigate the system more effectively, reducing the burden on judges and ensuring fewer families fall through the cracks. 
“It may be just legal knowledge and information so that people can better advocate for themselves and put their stories together on their own,” she said. 
With the immigration court system under so much stress, and with immigration enforcement policy changing rapidly, many immigrants have a difficult choice: remain in the U.S. and face rising uncertainty, or return to a home country and face potentially life-threatening circumstances. 
Messali said she hopes Connecticut residents, many of whom are her clients’ neighbors and coworkers, can resist what she sees as misrepresentations of immigrants. Instead, she hopes they’ll try to understand the pressure many immigrants are under — and their resilience in the face of it.
“The biggest thing I wish people knew is just how wonderful my clients are, just how wonderful the immigrant communities in our state and throughout our country are — how hopeful, decent, hard working, giving and generous they are,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LAWYER-IMM-0314-DE-010-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-29 05:00:50.032714

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Highway 50 is calling.
From home on Constitution Street in Emporia, I am within walking distance of the route Time magazine called the “backbone of America.” Three blocks to the south, the highway eddies and swirls with local traffic, those headed to work or coming back from a grocery run or, after dark, young people cruising the Sonic to show off. The highway doesn’t carry as much traffic as it used to — the interstate on the north end of town is faster if you’re bound for Wichita or Kansas City — but if you’re in no hurry and have a sense of adventure, U.S. Highway 50 is your path.
I’ve followed the highway there and back for most of my life.
It unwinds in my imagination like a rattler dodging grain trucks on a strip of baking asphalt. The highway has been the conduit for every true adventure I’ve had in the West, and when my wheels have been too long in one spot I become restless, thinking of scorching summers on the high plains and Rocky Mountain passes cloaked with snow.
Highway 50 doesn’t have the charisma of Route 66, a bygone road synonymous with American kitsch, but 50 remains the hard-traveled street of truckers, laborers and journeymen poets. Its two lanes stretch about 3,000 miles from Ocean City, Maryland, to Sacramento, California. It takes 12 days to travel all of it, one-way, according to a website by somebody who has done it. I’ve traversed most of 50, except for the first bit in Maryland, but I reckon I’ll get to that eventually. Portions of the highway, especially the lonely stretch out in Nevada, have been traveled by Jack Kerouac and William Least Heat-Moon. I’ve driven that route as well, when Kim and I returned from Sacramento one summer, and I remember watching the fuel gauge and worrying if the Jeep would make it to the next gas station. It did, but barely. Out West, poor planning is punished with inconvenience or worse.
When I was a kid, my dad would plan meticulously for summer vacation, carefully hiding a couple of hundred dollars in cash and traveler’s checks in the trunk of our old Ford and stocking the cooler with bologna. In those days — say, 1970 — average people didn’t have credit cards and most places wouldn’t take plastic anyway. I was reminded of this when I tried to pay for parking at a motel in the Texas panhandle last week and was told I’d have to use an app on my phone, as the establishment had gone cashless. This did not prevent the staff from accepting actual dollars in tips.
In those early trips with my father at the wheel it became a habit to leave Baxter Springs about dawn, pick up Highway 50 around Pratt, and drive with only the most necessary of stops until we reached western Kansas. Then we’d stop for gas someplace near Dodge City and get orange sodas from a big red change-gobbling dispensing machine. By that time it was approaching midday, and if it wasn’t yet 100 degrees in the shade, it soon would be. We didn’t drink orange sodas much at home, but on these westbound odysseys the ice-cold bottles of orange stuff became the thirst quencher of choice, abetted no doubt by the sugar jolt. If we were ahead of schedule, we’d do some tourist thing. I remember a stop at Dodge City and a quick tour of Boot Hill, a stop at the wax museum across the street, and a youthful obsession with gunfighters. Decades later, I would set a novel in Dodge City.
There isn’t the space here to list all of the locations along Highway 50 that have influenced me, but I can cite a few.
In Kansas, they include Holcomb, where the 1959 murder of the Clutter family was the germ for one of the first modern true crime books, “In Cold Blood.” Author Truman Capote, with research help from his friend Nell, rendered the “village” of Holcomb in painful and painstaking detail.
“The land is flat, and the views are awesomely extensive,” Capote writes. “Horses, herds of cattle, and a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples are visible long before a traveler reaches them.”
Now, phalanxes of wind turbines would have to be added to that description.
Highway 50 follows the Arkansas River upstream across the western third of Kansas and into Colorado. At Granada, you can see Camp Amache, a World War II concentration camp for Japanese Americans that is now a National Park Service historic site. Most of those imprisoned were from urban areas in California, and the relocation to the harsh plains of Colorado must have felt like a special punishment.
Between Las Animas and La Junta, the highway comes near Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site. Located on the Santa Fe Trail, the 1833 fort was built for trade in buffalo robes with trappers and the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho nations. The site is a recreation, but so expertly done it’s the next best thing to time travel. My favorite part? The historically accurate peacocks roaming the courtyard.
At Canon City, the highway swings around the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility, where the gas chamber was used to kill 32 inmates from 1934 to 1967. It’s a working prison, and some years ago I was briefly detained by grim-faced officers who didn’t like me taking photos of the guard towers from a public street.
Leaving Canon City, the highway threads spectacular gorges as the Arkansas plunges down from the headwaters, a journey I wrote about in my book, “Elevations.” At Salida, 50 leaves the river and proceeds west to Utah and Nevada. At Carson City, the Nevada State Railroad Museum offers an impressive collection of locomotives and rolling stock. Carson City also has close historical ties to Mark Twain, who recounted his arrival from Missouri in “Roughing It.”
“Visibly our new home was a desert, walled in by barren, snow-clad mountains,” Twain wrote. “We were plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in thick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning house.”
Twain knew the appeal of adventure for the American soul, and he was drawn to the West because of his older brother, Orion, who had been named secretary to the territorial governor.
“I coveted his distinction and his financial splendor,” Twain recalled, “but particularly and especially the long, strange journey he was going to make (to Nevada), and the curious new worlds he was going to explore. He was going to travel! I never had been away from home, and that word ‘travel’ had a seductive charm for me. Pretty soon (Orion) would be hundreds and hundreds of miles away on the great plains and deserts, and among the mountains of the Far West, and would see buffaloes and Indians, and prairie-dogs, and antelopes, and have all kinds of adventures, and maybe get hanged or scalped, and have ever such a fine time, and write home and tell us all about it.”
Twain’s racism aside, he makes a point. It is the ambition of many writers to have adventures and write home about them, I suppose. Most of the tight spots I’ve encountered while adventuring were those of my own making, while hiking or paddling, but the incident with perhaps the greatest potential for violence came on the return leg of one of those summer trips with Dad.
We were crossing western Kansas on Highway 50 at about 1 in the morning, on the way back from our first and only trip to Disneyland, and we were somewhere near Garden City. My father was driving, my mother was sitting beside him, and I was in the back. My parents had been talking about the Clutter murders, as my mother had read “In Cold Blood,” and they were pondering the nature of evil. The Hell’s Angels also scared them, probably because people were still talking about Hunter S. Thompson’s 1967 book. Also, my father — a carpet salesman for Sears and Roebuck — had been briefly kidnapped, at the point of a cheap pistol, a couple of years prior by a hitchhiking young man he gave a ride to on Route 66 between Riverton and Baxter Springs. So the anxiety in our old Ford as it sliced through the western Kansas darkness was thick.
Gradually, a car came up from the darkness behind us with its brights on and followed too closely for several miles. Then it passed recklessly, swerving and honking. I don’t know what kind of car it was, but I remember it being dark and loud. After it passed, my father slowed to allow more distance between us and the dark car.
Years have passed, and my memory of the incident is likely imperfect, but I recall us watching as the dark car swung over to the side of the road, did a U-turn, and came racing back at us. It zoomed by. Then it did another 180, accelerated, and stayed on our bumper for several miles.
My father didn’t know what to do.
Whatever my parents said at the time has been lost in memory. But I do remember my father mentioning the gun.
He had packed a rifle in the trunk.
It was a .22, a semi-automatic with a tubular magazine, the kind of rifle you used for plinking or for small game. My father didn’t own a pistol, having been frightened by them all of his life, but there were a couple of shotguns at the house in Baxter, used mostly for quail hunting. The 12-gauge pump would have been a better self-defense weapon, but the .22 is what he had grabbed, and like most things in our house — guitars, tennis rackets, runs — it was a Sears-exclusive model.
But there was little chance to park, pop the trunk, and dig the .22 from beneath the cooler and luggage and clothes. My father had asked my advice before the trip on whether he should bring the gun. He had this habit of sometimes asking me adult questions, even though I wasn’t yet a teenager. Influenced by my gunfighter worship, I had declared nobody should go anywhere without a gun.
Now his face was illuminated by the glare of the headlights reflecting from the rearview mirror, and I could see that he was disappointed by the decision. What good was a squirrel gun in this situation?
It was one of the first times I remember being ashamed of advice I’d given.
I’ve written briefly about this encounter before, but because that column was about angry drivers, I left out the part about the .22 rifle. I also omitted it because of the conflicted feelings the gun still evokes.
The occupants of the other car — and there was more than the driver, we could see that when they passed — may have been drunk or “doped up” or just plain crazy. But my father didn’t intend to find out what their problem was. The next time they did a U-turn and came back at us, feinting over the center line, my father stomped on the accelerator and the V-8 Ford lurched forward. The distance between us and the interlopers increased. They did another 180 to pursue us, but they had difficulty closing the gap.
The next town was only a few miles ahead.
The darkness whistled by at 100 mph.
It seemed for a moment the dark car would overtake us, and then when we reached the city limits they broke off, turned, and went the other direction. We fairly flew through the Main Street of the deserted town, and my father said he hoped it would attract the attention of any local cops who might be patrolling. There was no calling 911 on your cell.
The police had all turned in for the night. At the other side of town, my father slowed the Ford down, and we made the rest of the journey home without incident. For years, we would talk about that early morning in western Kansas, but we could never make much sense of it. Had it been a real threat? Did my mother’s reading of “In Cold Blood” create an unreasonable fear? And the question I still ask myself: Why had my father asked my advice on the gun?
My parents only lasted as a couple for another few years. After that, they led separate lives but oddly remained married. That complicated things when my mother died of untreated breast cancer another decade on.
I don’t know what that menacing dark car before dawn on a western Kansas highway had to do with any of what happened later. I just know in some way it did. I could feel the gulf between them widen. They avoided each other’s gaze, smoked cigarettes in separate rooms, spoke to one another in whispered sentence fragments or anguished shouts.
Some nights I ponder the incident on that dark highway of so long ago and conclude it was just an example of how inherently dangerous the world can be. At other times, I believe it has to do with the consequences of bad choices, of asking children to behave as adults, of carrying impossible burdens. My parents are both dead now, so I can speak with candor.
But perhaps it’s really a lesson in my conflicted relationship with my parents. Travel doesn’t just mean adventure, it means escape. I remember riding in the back seat of the Ford and thinking that someday my real parents would show up to claim me.
The incident on Highway 50 was so long ago now that it feels like nothing more than a bad dream. I have little insight, other than to say it remains an indigestible chunk in the soup of memory.
It did not make me fear travel. I’ve always been comfortable driving at night. But blinding headlights coming up from behind can still induce sweating, anxiety, and near panic.
When Kim and I were on our way to the Texas panhandle recently, we stopped in Pratt. I found an old-fashioned glass bottle of orange soda at a grocery store, Kim got a bottle of imported cane sugar Coke, and we drank them in the car. We looked each other in the eye, spoke in normal tones, and laughed.
The orange soda tasted sweeter than ever.

Forget plane crashes and fights about who gets the armrest.  If you survive TSA, a middle seat, and boarding group 9, now you have to make it through the flight itself without your body unraveling like cheap luggage on a baggage carousel.


Let’s start with deep vein thrombosis, or what they call the “Deadly Window Seat Special.”  You sit there for five hours without moving (thanks, beverage cart), and your blood turns sluggish, like airport Wi-Fi during a gate change.  Congratulations — you’re now flying DVT Airlines.  The longer the flight, the better your odds of a one-way ticket to the ER.  Solution:  get up every hour or so and walk.  And drink lots of water.
Feeling thirsty?  You should be.  Aircraft cabins at altitude are drier than the pretzels in coach. Humidity in-flight hovers around 10%, meaning your eyeballs are shriveling and your skin is turning into parchment.  Lubricating eye-drops and moisturizer should help.
Speaking of airplane air, did you know the cabin is pressurized only to the altitude of Denver?  That’s great but only if you’re a bighorn sheep (the 787, A350 and A380 jets are an exception).  For the rest of us, the lower oxygen can make you woozy or give your heart a surprise cardio session.  Got COPD or anemia?  Check with your doctor before flying.
Then there’s the inflight ear torture, courtesy of barotrauma.  This is why babies start crying before landing.  As the plane descends, your ears feel clogged as the pressure builds. Pop. Crackle. Pain.  But don’t worry… chewing gum, awkward jaw-stretching exercises or giving babies a bottle will probably help.  Or buy yourself a pair of EarPlane earplugs.
Crossing several time zones? Get ready for jet lag, also known as time-travel-induced dopiness.  Your body thinks it’s 3 a.m. in Hartford, but you’re eating airport sushi in Tokyo.  They say it takes one day of adjustment for each time zone you cross.
And for you frequent fliers: congratulations on your elite status… and cumulative cosmic radiation exposure.  One transatlantic flight gives you about as much radiation as one or two dental x-rays.  Not glowing, but not nothing.  Trans-polar flights leave you the most vulnerable.
Add in poor air circulation, recycled germs, and some guy sneezing in row 13 — and suddenly that N95 mask doesn’t seem so paranoid.  Still feeling like a little nosh?  Too bad.  Your guts are rebelling too. Gas expands at altitude, so avoid the bean salad.
Flying doesn’t just take you places. It slowly breaks down your body in a pressurized metal tube full of crying babies and funky air.  But hey, at least your suitcase made it to Cleveland.
PS:  While train travel is my preferred mode, extended sitting enroute is still a problem.  But at least you can get up at will and stroll to the Café Car for some over-priced AmFood.  Try the cheeseburger.  It’s actually pretty good.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/woman-on-plane-in-mask-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-29 05:00:50.032714

Utah Sen. Mike Lee withdraws a plan that could have auctioned more than a million acres.
The post Western public land sale axed from Senate budget bill appeared first on WyoFile .","Utah Sen. Mike Lee withdrew his land-sale provision from the Senate reconciliation budget bill Saturday evening.
“I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock, and not to any foreign interest,” Lee posted on X. “For that reason, I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill.”
The Republican had sought to require the sale of Bureau of Land Management property — owned by all Americans — to help Western communities resolve affordable housing worries. Critics said existing laws allow such sales and that the measure violated a core western value — public access to public land.
“Total faceplant.” Land Tawney
More than one million acres of public land were at stake. The provision required the government to auction the property rapidly and with curtailed public involvement.
Conservationists, hunters and anglers and outdoor recreation businesses erupted in virtual applause after Lee conceded. Opposition across the West stirred thousands to rally in support of continued ownership of and access to their publicly owned property.
“Public lands are the cornerstone of our conservation legacy,” Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited said in a statement heralding the provision’s demise.
Others were less reserved.
“Total faceplant,” wrote Land Tawney, co-chair of American Hunters & Anglers.
“He rewrote his scheme multiple times,” Tawney said of Lee. “And tonight? He yanked his own language from the bill,” Tawney wrote in a statement.
A coalition of outdoor businesses that claims to be part of a $1.2 trillion recreation economy said the budget reconciliation process “was the wrong vehicle for deciding the fate of America’s public lands.
“Selling off public lands in this way was not just out of touch with public sentiment,” the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable coalition said, “it could have impacted businesses, jobs, public health, and the many rural communities that depend on access to outdoor recreation for economic development and quality of life.”

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan are considering a wide-ranging bill that could affect Medicaid, Alaska oil and gas development and the size of the federal debt. (Alaska Beacon file photos)The U.S. Senate is nearing debate on a wide-ranging bill that includes a series of last-minute changes that would uniquely offset or exempt some of its costs for Alaska. 
The changes highlight the importance of the votes of each Republican senator — including those of Alaska Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — to advance the bill, named the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” after its description by President Donald Trump. It includes much of Trump’s agenda, and is advancing under special reconciliation rules.
In the days leading up to any floor votes, Alaska health experts said cuts to Medicaid and food stamps in the bill would devastate Alaska health care providers, patients and the broader state economy connected to health spending. Medicaid is the primary health program for lower-income Americans, and pays for long-term care for a broad swathe of families. More than 231,000 Alaskans were enrolled in May.
Murkowski and Sullivan have expressed support for provisions of the bill that seek to increase oil and gas production in the state, though Murkowski has criticized proposed cuts to health care and nutrition funding. It’s not clear how each would vote on a final bill. 
An updated 940-page version of the bill was released on Friday evening. It includes a variety of changes that would distinctly affect Alaska and, in some cases, Hawaii. 
As reported by States Newsroom and the New York Times, these changes include:

a tax exemption for fishers in Western Alaska;
an increase in amount of expenses like exploding projectiles that whaling captains can deduct, from $10,000 to $50,000; 
an increase in the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government by 25% for Alaska and 15% for Hawaii; 
allowing the Alaska and Hawaii state governments to request an exemption from a work requirement for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients; 
a two-year exemption for Alaska and Hawaii from paying a higher share of SNAP expenses; and
an increase in payments to certain providers for services in Alaska and Hawaii through Medicaid, the insurance program for people 65 and older, as reported by the New York Times. 

Alaska providers and advocates had expressed alarm 
Before the latest revision, Alaska health care providers and advocates said they were alarmed by the cuts to Medicaid in the bill.

	Preliminary research by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage estimates that the bill’s Medicaid cuts would cost Alaska 3,000 lost jobs — the fourth-steepest loss among the states — and a $322.1 million decrease in the economy. 
While the bill’s drafters aim for the Medicaid cuts to save money, they will be costly to Alaska, said Emily Nenon, Alaska government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. She spoke at a news conference held by provider and advocacy groups on Wednesday.
“We need people to have access to health care before they need it … because outcomes are better, because we have a healthier workforce,” Nenon said. 
Nenon said the primary way people would lose access to Medicaid is by requiring them to report that they are working. She pointed to research showing that many who work or are eligible for other exemptions will lose access to Medicaid because they don’t meet the reporting requirement. 
“It’s not about whether people are working, most people that are going to be subject to these work reporting requirements are working,” she said. “It’s a matter of having another hoop to jump through.”
Nenon also noted the importance of Medicaid to the economy.
Alaska had 2,900 fewer employed residents in May than it had a decade earlier, in May 2015. Most industries contracted in that time, but health care grew by 7,900 jobs, more than any other industry by a significant margin.
Nenon said Alaska can’t afford the 3,000 lost jobs estimated by ISER, adding that having more people with untreated conditions or delayed treatment will also lead to fewer people being able to work. 
Rachael Miller, chief advocacy officer for the Food Bank of Alaska, expressed concern on Wednesday that shifting costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto the state government would present problems in Alaska, where the state government is already struggling with the state budget and with administering SNAP. She expressed concern about the combined effect of SNAP and Medicaid cuts on families.
“So we know that food is often the most flexible line in a household budget,” she said. “We know that people do sometimes — they can’t afford their prescription, they cut their nutrition budget, because they have to afford their meds, they have to rent and they have to pay their heat.”
Also on Wednesday, Petersburg Medical Center CEO Phil Hofstetter said the Medicaid cuts would require the hospital to focus more on meeting bureaucratic requirements. And he said reduced payments would lead to cuts to services and staffing.
“I just don’t understand the premise of these cuts improving health care when the highest cost of health care comes in through medevacs, ERs, and inpatient stays,” all of which would be increased by requiring people to wait longer for health care by reducing Medicaid, Hofstetter said. “We know that prevention is a much less costly avenue for health care, and it’s better for our patients in general.”
Dr. Casey Gokey, chief medical officer of Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center, noted estimates that up to 27,000 Alaskans could lose access to health care. 
“On paper, these work requirements might sound simple, but in practice they create a maze of paperwork and confusion,” Gokey said. “Many of our patients seasonal jobs, gig jobs, hourly jobs — jobs that don’t fit neatly into eligibility boxes. They miss a deadline, they get caught in red tape and suddenly, they’re uninsured.”
Gokey said she saw a cancer patient this week who delayed care because she couldn’t afford it. She applied for Medicaid months ago, but the application is still being processed, and the patient showed signs that the cancer may have spread, Gokey said. 
“This is not a one-off story,” she said. “This is a reality of what delayed care looks like.”
Fairbanks resident Kristen Lindsay, currently working as a sea kayak guide in Seward, said Medicaid helped her survive cancer. She was otherwise uninsured when she was diagnosed with breast cancer from an MRI she received on her 34th birthday. With Medicaid, she was able to have three surgeries to remove the cancer, radiation treatment and medication.











You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’


– Kristen Lindsay, cancer survivor and Fairbanks resident



	Lindsay then got a part-time job, without health insurance, but still had Medicaid. She’s grateful she didn’t have to spend time proving she was working while she was focused on getting better. 
“You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’” she said. She noted that seasonal work is common in Alaska, and Medicaid helps fill the gaps. 
Attention turns to senators
Health care providers and patient advocates haven’t been the only ones asking Murkowski and Sullivan to reject Medicaid and SNAP cuts. 
Alaska Senate Majority Leader Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, wrote a commentary for the New York Times published Friday with the headline “Alaska Cannot Survive the Big Beautiful Bill.”
“We fear that if this bill passes, a village in rural Alaska might lose its one and only grocery store because of a drastic decline in SNAP dollars,” Edgmon and Giessel wrote. “It might also lose its sole health care clinic or hospital because it cannot sustain its services with decreased Medicaid reimbursements. The reconciliation bill does not take into account the uniqueness of Alaskan lifestyles and geographic remoteness.”
While the Medicaid and SNAP provisions were the focus of attention for some, the state’s governor focused on other aspects of how the bill would affect Alaska. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy highlighted those aspects on social media on Friday. He noted that the bill would direct 90% of Cook Inlet oil gas lease bonuses, rents and royalties to the state starting in 2035; require four federal oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain; direct 50% of ANWR receipts to the state until 2034, and 90% from 2035 on; ease other mineral leasing restrictions and require the Bureau of Land Management to hold quarterly lease sales; and target more than $4 billion for “investments in shore facilities,” including $300 million for the homeporting of a polar icebreaker.
Despite the Medicaid cuts, the bill would raise the national debt by $4.2 trillion, according to the latest estimate by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — though the official cost is 90% lower, after Senate leaders made accounting for it differently than previous bills. They did that by excluding an extension of $3.8 trillion in tax cuts that Republicans want to make permanent.

Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, joined Michiganders virtually for a Hands Off Medicaid rally in Lansing. 
While Murphy had originally planned to attend Saturday’s rally in person, the U.S. Senate vote scheduled for Saturday required that Murphy remain in Washington D.C. 
In addressing the crowd, Senator Murphy reiterated how devastating the GOP bill would be to most Americans. 
“We’re talking about 60 million people losing their health care,” Murphy explained, “most of those working Americans, a lot of them really, really vulnerable, very, very sick and disabled Americans. Many of those children. All in order to transfer that money to the very, very wealthy.”

Moreover, Murphy said, the plan has not been well-received by the public. 
“As people find out about this, they hate it,” Murphy noted. “With long-term distractions, in the first five months, we had a hard time breaking through. Well, now we’re breaking through because of what you’re doing today, because of similar protests all around the country like this, and this thing isn’t over until it’s over.”
The bill would extend the 2017 tax cuts approved by a GOP-led Congress during President Donald Trump’s first term, while also pushing through major spending cuts that would drastically downsize the federal government. 
Even if the Senate approves the measure, changes to the bill’s language will require it to return to the House for another vote. At least six congressional Republicans have since walked back their initial support, making it unclear whether the bill could garner enough votes a second time.
While Murphy headlined Saturday’s event in Lansing, Michigan leaders and healthcare advocates also spoke to the dozens who attended Saturday’s rally.

Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Healthcare, explained that this is not a partisan issue: as a doctor from West Michigan, many of his patients voted for Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Now, many of those same patients stand to lose access to their healthcare. 
As the only physician in the Michigan Legislature, Rep. Matt Longjohn (D-Portage) outlined how the proposed cuts to Medicaid would affect Michigan. 
“What it’ll mean is that there is uncompensated care, that there’s low value care, and that will break the bank for healthcare systems and hospitals and rural health centers alike,” Longjohn said. “It’s not good for patients, it’s not good for providers, it’s not good for systems, [and] it’s not good for communities.”

Longjohn also pointed out that 40% of Michigan’s budget comes from federal funds that are distributed to the state specifically to run programs like Medicaid. As such, he says the impacts of the proposed cuts would be disastrous to the state’s economy. 
“When you throw a boulder as big as this into a pond, you know the ripple effect will affect millions, and for a long time,” Longjohn said.
Beyond policy concerns, Longjohn expressed frustration with those advocating for the bill’s passage. 
“One of the things that frustrates me most is that the people pushing this are cowards,” Longjohn noted. “They will not answer voicemail, they will not answer letters, they will not show up to meetings with constituents.”
While Longjohn declined to name these legislators, others at the rally directly identified two by name: Reps. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) and John James (R-Shelby Township).

Nearly six months into their two-year terms, Barrett and James have largely avoided town halls. Since taking office in January, Barrett has held only two town halls– both of which were conducted virtually. James has yet to hold any constituent events and has not given any indication that he intends to do so. 
The Senate Budget Committee revealed the finalized language of the bill late Friday night. The first round of votes was anticipated to begin Saturday afternoon, but ongoing negotiations postponed the start of formal discussion. 
Murphy told the crowd that each day that final passage is delayed, the bill becomes less likely to pass. 
“Because right now, this country is waking up to the cataclysm that will occur if this thing passes,” Murphy said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.












Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance




Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Republicans from all corners of Montana convened in Helena during the weekend for the paryt’s annual convention and to elect new party leadership 
Delegates elected Art Wittich to serve for a two-year term as party chair. 
“Folks, I think our purpose is conservative government, and we’re going to do some things that haven’t been tried in the past,” Wittich said after his election. “… I want to keep winning elections, but I also want us to dedicate ourselves to things that are higher than winning elections, and that’s things like truth.”
Four party members threw their hats in the ring for leadership of the state GOP — Wittich, Stacy Zinn, Tanner Smith, and Troy Miller. 
Wittich was elected on the second ballot. Smith and Miller were eliminated after the first round of voting. 
He is an attorney and former state legislator who represented a portion of Gallatin County from 2011 to 2016, and served as Senate Majority Leader during the 2013 session.
Following the announcement of his election, Wittich told the gathered Republicans that they should all seek to be a “happy warrior,” and look forward to bright days for the party ahead. 
“We’re a red state. We could become a bright red state,” he said. “And we can do it without dividing and subtracting. We can grow.”

However the GOP convention on Saturday took a detour toward division when, during the credentialing of delegates able to vote for party leaders, state Sen. Barry Usher of Billings made a motion to remove nine fellow senators from the list. 
The nine state senators were censured by the GOP executive committee during the legislature over a series of votes taken in conjunction with Democrats to establish Senate rules and move forward large pieces of legislation including the state’s budget. 
A roll call vote among 241 gathered delegates saw more than two-thirds vote to remove the nine from their delegate roles. 
Among the nine Republican senators who appeared at the convention in person were Sens. Jason Ellsworth, of Hamilton; Denley Loge of St. Regis; Wendy McKamey of Great Falls, and Russ Tempel of Chester. 
Ellsworth told the Daily Montanan he was disappointed that the actions taken against the nine elected officials went against a message of unity that had been delivered during the first day of the convention. 
“It just cements division,” said Ellsworth, a former Senate president who was censured by the entire state Senate this year. “Republicans are strong, and should continue to be strong, but also recognize that, you know, it is a big tent, and it does take more than one philosophy.”
Loge told the Daily Montanan that he felt justified that his votes were in line with his constituents, who voted him in, as opposed to the executive board or state central committee. 
“The reason I’m the only Senator that’s Republican in part of Missoula County, and it’s because the constituents recognize I vote for them,” he said. 
With a total of 235 certified delegates voting for the party chair, Wittich earned 140 final votes and Zinn received 94, with one ballot excluded. 
Wittich replaces party chair Don “K” Kaltschmidt who served in the role for six years and oversaw a red wave through the state including Republicans winning all statewide elected offices, including the governorship, as well as all of Montana’s Congressional seats — for the first time in 100 years.
Kaltschmidt previously told the Daily Montanan that he was proud of his work turning Montana into a true red state, and that the next chairman would be tasked with leading the new era of GOP dominance. 
“It’s really up to the next chairman to take it to the next level, which would be learning how to be a red state,” he told the Daily Montanan.

Delegates elected members of the executive board including Zinn for vice chair, and Lola Galloway as secretary. 
Wittich’s tenure will last through 2027, a term which will span a legislative cycle election and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines’ reelection campaign. 
“I’m not tired of winning. I don’t think any of us are tired of winning,” he said. “I think when we embrace a positive vision for Montanans. They’re going to join us. They’re going to vote for us. They’re going to give us their time and their treasure, and we’re just going to keep getting bigger and better.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6314-1024x734.jpg,,,2025-06-28 17:04:13.685468

The bill also addresses concerns from Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska on access to food assistance for their constituents despite new restrictions on a USDA program for low-income people.As talks continued on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon, a handful of Senate Republicans, including Missouri’s Eric Schmitt and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were on the golf course with Trump, according to the White House. Graham said on social media that Kentucky’s Rand Paul also played.Senate Democrats said a fresh financial analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the preliminary Senate text would result in $930 billion in cuts over 10 years to Medicaid, the joint federal-state low-income health insurance and disability assistance program.The CBO score was not yet publicly available but Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, pointed to it and slammed the Medicaid provisions as “cruel” in a statement Saturday afternoon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, also cited the preliminary analysis, pointing to the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts. The House version was scored by CBO as making about $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years.Collins promises amendmentsSenate Republicans planned to take their negotiations to the floor and push for amendments after a procedural vote that will trigger official debate on the bill, which in its current public version runs 940 pages.GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voiced concerns throughout negotiations about rural hospitals and health cuts that would harm low-income individuals, said her vote on what is called a motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”“I will be filing a number of amendments,” she told reporters as she headed into a closed-door working lunch before the Senate convened at 2 p.m. Eastern.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he will vote “no” on both the procedural vote and final passage.While Sen. Tim Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that he was a “no” on the motion to proceed because of a provision to sell off federal public lands, the Montana Republican changed his mind nearly an hour later and declared he would propose an amendment to strip provision.The latest version of the measure, championed by GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, sets up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs. This will increase the supply of housing and decrease housing costs for millions of American families.”GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”“We won't bring it to the floor if we don't have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.Medicaid turmoilProposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he’s a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.“If you want to be a working-class party, you've got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.‘Even worse than any draft’Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.The lawmakers also planned to force a reading of the entire 940-page legislation on the floor ahead of the vote.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we've seen this far.”The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it's worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”“We'll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We'll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.House actionSenate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”",,,,2025-06-28 17:04:13.685468

Free.,US Senate votes to advance Republican mega-bill in tense late-night session,"Ashley Murray, Shauneen Miranda, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-votes-advance-republican-mega-bill-tense-late-night-session,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted mostly along party lines late Saturday night to move forward with Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump wants on his desk in less than a week, after a dramatic three-hour pause when several GOP senators withheld their votes.Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina  and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with the sweeping tax break and spending cuts package that contains many of the GOP’s campaign promises. All Democrats were opposed. Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol in case a tie-breaking vote was required, but in the end was not needed.Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, had told reporters earlier that he would vote “no” on what is called a motion to proceed and on final passage. He said in a statement the legislation would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina and force the state to make “painful decisions” about Medicaid. Trump in a post on social media later threatened to find primary candidates to challenge Tillis.The 51-49 vote doesn’t guarantee the bill will make it through a final passage vote but does make it significantly more likely, even with Republicans’ narrow 53-47 majority.The procedural vote kicked off a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate on the bill, with half of that time controlled by Democrats and the other half by Republicans — though Democrats after the motion to proceed vote forced a reading of the giant bill expected to take as long as 15 hours. That would mean floor debate would not begin until sometime Sunday.Unlike regular bills, budget reconciliation packages are not subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so as long as at least 50 Republicans support the package, and Vance casts the tie-breaking vote if needed, the measure will go back to the House.

The vote on the motion to proceed that began at about 7:30 p.m. Eastern was held open for more than three hours, with the votes of four senators in suspense — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida. All four eventually voted aye and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson switched his vote to aye after earlier voting against the measure.Lee, however, just before the vote was over, announced he had pulled from the bill an extremely controversial proposal to sell some public lands that was opposed by other lawmakers from the West. He said because of the process being used for the bill, he was unable to obtain enforceable safeguards to ensure the land would be sold to American families and not China or foreign interests.The latest version of the measure had set up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs.

Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”“We won't bring it to the floor if we don't have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.Medicaid turmoilProposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters Saturday he would be a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.“If you want to be a working-class party, you've got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.Clean energy tax creditsIn what clean power advocates dubbed a “midnight dumping,” Senate GOP leadership added language to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits that were enacted under Democrats’ own massive mega-bill in 2022 titled the “Inflation Reduction Act.”The language, which wasn’t yet finalized by Senate GOP tax writers as of 6 p.m. Eastern Saturday, tightened restrictions on foreign components in wind and solar projects — and added a new tax on those that don’t comply.Senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.Clean energy industry manufacturers and small businesses had hoped Senate Republicans would ease up rollbacks in the House version.Kurt Neutgens, president and chief technology officer of Orange EV, told States Newsroom in an interview Friday that any further rollbacks would amount to “cutting our legs out from underneath us.”Neutgens, whose Kansas City, Kansas-based company manufactures heavy duty electric trucks and chargers, was watching for changes to credits to the commercial clean vehicles credit. New Senate GOP text would terminate the credit in September of this year.Jason Grumet, president of the Clean Power Association, said in a statement Saturday that imposing new taxes on the industry “will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”Alaska carve-outsProposed cuts to federal food assistance remained largely unchanged in the new text released Friday night except for a few carve-outs for Alaska.If the bill were enacted as written, Alaska’s state government could request a waiver for its citizens from stricter work reporting requirements that critics say will result in some SNAP recipients losing their food benefits.GOP lawmakers also slightly shifted the timeline for when states will have to begin shouldering SNAP costs — the first time states will be on the hook for the federal food assistance outside of administrative costs.States would be required to pick up a portion of the costs depending on their “payment error rate” — meaning how accurate states are at determining who needs SNAP, including both overpayments and underpayments.States that have error rates at 6% or above would responsible for up to 15% of the food program’s cost. According to SNAP error rate data for 2023, the latest available, only seven states had an error rate below 6%.The new text delays the cost-sharing for states until 2028 and allows states to choose the lesser of their two error rates in either 2025 or 2026.Starting in 2029, states will be required to use their error rate from three years prior to the current year.The new text includes the option for Alaska and Hawaii to waive their cost share burden for up to two years if their governments implement an improvement plan. In 2023, Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states, reaching just above 60%. Advocates for low-income families worry the cost, which will amount to billions for most state governments, will incentivize states to tighten eligibility requirements for the program, or even drop SNAP altogether.The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the cuts will affect up to 40 million people who receive basic SNAP assistance, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors.The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.Despite inaccurate public statements from Republicans as recently as in a bill summary released overnight, the bill does nothing to limit food assistance to immigrants without documentation because SNAP was never available to them.SNAP benefits will remain available to legal permanent residents, and Republicans loosened some language to allow certain immigrants from Cuba or Haiti to access the program.But if the bill passes, federal food assistance will not be available to refugees and asylees who are already in the U.S. — for example, people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other war-torn places.Education revisionsRepublicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions revised or scrapped several measures that the parliamentarian deemed to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, according to a summary and new bill text out Friday.Under the revised text, for any loans made starting July 1, 2026, borrowers will have only two repayment plan options: a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. The original proposal would have applied these restrictions to existing borrowers, but the parliamentarian struck that down.Republicans also nixed a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are not accredited.The new plan also scraps a restriction that barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.‘Even worse than any draft’Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we've seen this far.”The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it's worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”“We'll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We'll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.House actionSenate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-28 23:58:58.843021

Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photoSpeaker Emerita Melissa Hortman’s life embodied the American dream. She was raised in a family that owned a junkyard, became a lawyer but declined a life of comfortable wealth for public service, emerging as among the most influential legislators in Minnesota history.
Now she’s an emblem of the American nightmare, another victim — along with husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever Gilbert — of the political violence that’s consumed America in the past decade, adding Brooklyn Park to Buffalo, El Paso and other grim signposts of a damaged democracy.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral Mass at The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis Saturday as kind, generous and driven by a common set of values to make the world just a little bit better.
The funeral was mostly light on politics, despite the hundreds of politicos in attendance. Father Daniel Griffith in his homily, however, highlighted the injustices that Melissa Hortman tried to ameliorate.
“In Minnesota we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice — the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed our democracy.”

Tim Walz stand behind the caskets of Melissa and Mark Hortman during funeral services for Mark and Melissa Hortman at The Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis, Minn., on Saturday, June 28, 2025.

Gov. Tim Walz, who was both friend and governing partner to Hortman, was visibly shaken while serving as a pallbearer alongside the Hortman children. The packed Basilica was filled with Hortman’s family, friends and vast political network that Melissa Hortman built over decades by way of her effectiveness at the Legislature and down-to-earth charm. Former President Joe Biden — who hosted the Hortmans at the White House — Vice President Kamala Harris, former Gov. Mark Dayton, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and state commissioners also memorialized the lives of Hortmans.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
The Hortmans were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a politically motivated assassination. Their deaths have roiled Minnesota politics.
Hortman was a Catholic Sunday school teacher whose politics were shaped by Catholic social teaching. She was a devotee of the Golden Rule, from Matthew, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” So she would have endorsed the choice of Gospel reading Saturday, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, which is a fundamental text of Christianity.
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” Griffith said. “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.”
In his sermon, Griffith highlighted Melissa and Mark Hortman’s service and community, which he called, “the antidote to our present afflictions” and a stark contrast to the “idol of autonomy” that has ravaged America’s political landscape.
Melissa and Mark Hortman met in Washington D.C. when they were both mentoring a student. Colin and Sophie Hortman, their adult children, released a statement in the days after their killings, calling for people to honor their parents’ legacy by standing up “for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.”
Walz during his five-minute eulogy encouraged Minnesotans to find common humanity and “build a state equal to (the Hortmans’) aspirations and a politics worthy of their example.”
“Melissa was an extraordinary legislator, and Mark was her proudest supporter,” Walz said. “It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all of its significance, politics is just people. That’s all. It is just a bunch of human beings trying to do their best. Melissa understood that better than anybody.”
Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of Melissa and Mark, eulogized them at the request of the children. She remembered the Hortmans as anything but a stereotypical political family, just as focused on their children and dog and card nights and monthly dinners for law school friends as on the latest political flareup.
Williams also captured the dynamic between Melissa and her supportive husband.
“I always saw her as a balloon bouncing around, but still tethered to the earth by Mark,” Williams said.
Williams remembered the many dinners she shared with the Hortmans, including their last together on June 6 at an Italian restaurant in Robbinsdale. Walz had just called for a one-day special session, and Melissa was often getting up from the table to take calls from the governor or her DFL caucus members. No one at the table, including Mark Hortman, minded the disruption.

Even though many are grieved by the Hortmans’ deaths, Williams said that the couple would have wanted people to remember them with joy, citing Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet:”
“Some of you say joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”
“We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again,” Williams said. “Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way. Goodbye, my friends.” 
Colin Hortman ended the service with a prayer of St. Francis, which Melissa Hortman carried in her wallet.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
The procession departed in silence, except for the massive bell of The Basilica of St. Mary tolling, tolling.
The caskets were loaded into two hearses.
Walz handed Sophie and Colin Hortman American flags in the traditional 13-fold, for the Hortmans.
When the Hortmans were lying in state at the Capitol Friday, Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, wondered aloud what Melissa Hortman — who was famously blunt and unimpressed with grandeur — would have thought about all the pageantry.
“I think she would have said, ‘It’s a bit much.’”

(Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix))TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Seven years after the Florida Legislature approved a memorial recognizing the tragedy of slavery for the grounds of the Florida Capitol, the bronze statue called “Circle of Chains” has been completed and is on display across the street from the building.
Not that anyone is actually aware of that.
“I had no idea!” Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt told the Phoenix when asked about the public unveiling of the memorial earlier this week.
Neither did Miami-Dade County Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“I had no idea the memorial had even been installed – and that says a lot,” Jones told the Phoenix. “A monument honoring the pain and resilience of enslaved Africans deserves more than a quiet placement. After seven years of work, there should have been a moment to honor that history publicly.”
Approved in 2018
The Legislature approved the memorial during the 2018 legislative session. Miami-Dade Democrat Kionne McGhee sponsored the measure in the House, and Tampa Bay-area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson carried it in the Senate. The bill charged the Department of Management Services with developing its design, placement, and cost. It is located at the Black Archives-Union Bank Museum on Apalachee Parkway and was installed on April 28.
“The idea behind the memorial is to recognize the brutality of slavery and the cruelty of slavery towards a people and then to honor the nameless faces of individuals that suffer through slavery,” Rouson said this week.
State lawmakers dedicated $400,000 to erect the memorial, as they did during the 2016 legislative session for a Holocaust Memorial that was installed at the Capitol earlier this year. A public ceremony was held  for that event in March, attended by Gov. DeSantis.
The slavery monument was created by Carmel, California, sculptor Steven Whyte, selected by review committee members who called on artists to recognize “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the American colonies and to honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty contributions to the United States.”
As the House prepared to vote on the proposal in 2018, Rep. McGhee told lawmakers that slaves in 1845 helped construct the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee, according to WFSU-Radio. PolitiFact reported that although authorities were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction, African American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th Century, according to historians. PolitiFact labeled his comment “mostly true.” (McGhee, now a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, did not respond to a request for comment).
Plans for a formal ceremony
Rouson said he was informed by state officials that they wanted to install surveillance cameras on the property before making any formal announcement. “But now that surveillance is in place and there’s some protection in the event of vandalism, I intend to urge the Black Caucus to do more of a formal ceremony when we go back [this fall] for committee weeks,” he said.
Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said she knew the memorial was being constructed but wasn’t aware it had been finished and is now open to the public.
“I wholeheartedly support Sen. Rouson’s efforts for a formal opening ceremony this fall — the enslaved men, women, and children who built this country deserve to have their experience remembered and their legacy honored,” she said.
Sen. Jones said he also supports Rouson’s call for a “proper ceremony when we return.”
“Our ancestors deserve to be seen and acknowledged,” he said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Finance Committee convened at 10:17 p.m. Friday — over 12 hours after it was originally scheduled — to vote on a fraction of the budget areas it had originally planned and to release part of the literacy funding that is set to expire next week.  
Legislative leaders have been working behind closed doors over the last week to negotiate with Gov. Tony Evers and work out the details of the state budget as the end of the fiscal year approaches next week. 
Areas of the budget still left to take up are at the center of negotiations including the University of Wisconsin system, where Republicans have considered cuts, and the Department of Children and Families, which is responsible for the state’s Child Care Counts program. Evers has said he would veto a budget without funding for the program, which will run out of federal money soon. The committee also still needs to take up the Department of Health Services, the Department of Transportation, the capital budget and more. 
The committee co-chairs did not take questions from reporters ahead of the meeting, but as the meeting started Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said the other agencies “will be taken up at a later date.” He didn’t specify when that would be.
The budget committee did approve the budget for several state agencies including the Department of Natural Resources, part of the Department of Justice, the Higher Education Aids Board, the Department of Administration and the Tourism Department. Each action the committee did take passed along partisan lines.
Portion of $50 million for literacy released
The committee voted unanimously to release $9 million of the nearly $50 million left in funding for literacy initiatives that was first allocated in the 2023-25 state budget. The majority of the money has been withheld by lawmakers since 2023 and is slated to lapse back into the state’s general fund if not released by the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
Lawmakers said action on the other $40 million will be taken soon. 
“This has taken a long time to get here. One of the things that this bill was originally about was to make it so that kids could read. We want to help kids read. We want to give schools the tools to be able to do that,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said. “Unfortunately, it’s taken this Legislature a tremendous amount of time to allocate the funds for that, and ultimately, that’s simply not acceptable.” 
Born said he is glad lawmakers were releasing part of the money Friday and would have further motions on it in the future. He also said the delay on the funding was Evers’ fault. Lawmakers were holding the funding back due to a partial veto Evers exercised on a bill related to the literacy funding. The Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Wednesday that partial veto was  unconstitutional and restored the original language of the law.
“We’re glad that justice has been done, and we’re here now with the proper accounts and able to do these two separate motions here in the next couple of days in the committee to get this program that was a bipartisan program moving along,” Born said. 
Certain projects funded in DNR budget, Knowles-Nelson not 
Noticeably missing from the Republicans’ Department of Natural Resource motion was funding for the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program, which allows the agency to fund the purchase of public land and upkeep of recreational areas.
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said lawmakers were missing an opportunity by not funding the program in the budget. 
“There’s a lot of individual pet projects in here that seem to be of interest to individual legislators, but there aren’t a lot of park projects that are of interest to Wisconsinites, particularly Knowles-Nelson,” Andraca said.
The committee approved funding in the budget for an array of projects including $42 million to help with modernization of the Rothschild Dam, $500,000 to go towards the repair of a retaining wall for the Wisconsin Rapids Riverbank project, $2.2 million environmental remediation and redevelopment of Lake Vista Park in Oak Creek, $70,000 for a dredging project in Manitowoc River in the Town of Brillion, $1.75 million for dredging the Deerskin River and $100,000 for assistance with highway flooding in the Town of Norway in Racine County. 
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), who is the author of a bill to keep the program going, said lawmakers are working to ensure it handles the program in the best way, which is part of why the funding is not in the budget as of now. 
“We actually have until 30th of June of 2026 to work on this. It’s something that Sen. [Patrick] Testin and I have been working on along with our staff over the last six months. It’s something that is a bipartisan effort. We’ve met with so many different stakeholders, so many different groups, so many fellow legislators on getting this done,” Kurtz said. “We are committed to get it done.” 
Kurtz said that the hearing on the bill was “good” and there will be “a lot more coming up in the future” when it comes to Knowles-Nelson. 
The committee also approved raising nonresident vehicle admission sticker fees, nonresident campsite fees and campsite electricity fees. 
Office of School Safety, VOCA grants get state funding
The Department of Justice’s Office of School Safety will get 13 permanent staff positions and $1.57 million to continue its work. That’s about $700,000 less than what the agency had requested, but is about what Evers had proposed for the office. 
The office serves as a resource for K-12 schools — helping them improve security measures by providing training on crisis prevention and response, grants for safety enhancements, threat assessment training and mental health training. It also operates the Speak Up, Speak Out tipline where students can anonymously report safety concerns.
The Wisconsin DOJ will also get help filling funding gaps for Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants left by federal funding cuts. 
Wisconsin’s federal allocation for VOCA grants has been cut from $40 million to $13 million. Domestic violence shelters and victim services organizations along with the state DOJ have been navigating the limited funding for over a year. The organizations that receive VOCA grants help people who are the victims of a crime by assisting them with finding housing, providing transportation to and from court appearances and navigating the criminal justice system.
The Republican-approved motion will provide $20 million to cover the federal funding loss. It will also provide $163,500 for two staff positions, which will expire in July 2027. The Wisconsin DOJ had requested an additional $66 million in the budget to make up for the funding gap. 
McGuire noted the funding would be significantly less than what the state agency had requested and would essentially create a two-year program rather than an ongoing one.
“[This] maintains the Legislature’s level of input, but it doesn’t actually maintain the same level of service because of the declining revenues as a result of the federal government,” McGuire said. “While we can’t fix all the things that are the result of what the federal government is doing wrong … this is something that will have an impact on communities across the state. It’s going to have an impact on people who’ve had the worst day and the worst week in the worst month of their life. It’s gonna have an impact on people who have been harmed by violence who have been in toxic, abusive relationships. It’s going to have an impact on people who desperately need services through no fault of their own. These are really vulnerable people and they should receive our support.  
Wisconsin Grants to get slight infusion, UW budget postponed 
The committee did not take up the budget for the University of Wisconsin system. It’s been one of the key issues for debate as Republican lawmakers have considered cuts, while Evers and UW leaders have said the university system needs $855 million in additional funding. Evers has said that in negotiations he and lawmakers were discussing a “positive number.”
The committee did take up the Higher Educational Aids Board, which is the agency responsible for overseeing Wisconsin’s student financial aid system, investing in the Wisconsin Grant Program. The program provides grants to undergraduate Wisconsin residents enrolled at least half-time in degree or certificate programs.
The Wisconsin Grants program would receive an additional $5.6 million in 2025-26 and $11.9 million in 2026-27 under the proposal approved Friday. The UW system, private nonprofit colleges and Wisconsin Technical College System would receive equal dollar increases. It also includes a $75,000 increase for tribal college students.
Evers had proposed 20% increases for the Wisconsin Grants for the state’s public universities, private nonprofit colleges and technical colleges — a total $57.7 million investment.
The Wisconsin Technical Colleges System had requested $10.8 million in each year of the biennium, saying there has been a waitlist for the grants for the first time in 10 years and that list is projected to grow.
The committee also approved $3.5 million in 2026-27 in a supplemental appropriation for emergency medical services training costs to reimburse training and materials costs. 
“Recruiting volunteer EMS personnel is a challenge all over the state of Wisconsin — certainly is in my Senate district,” Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said. “We believe that this will remove one barrier to recruitment of volunteers in our EMS units all across the state.” 
Other portions of the budget approved Friday evening include: 

$30 million to the Tourism Department for general marketing, and an additional $1 million in the second year of the budget, as well as about $113,000 for state arts organizations and two staff positions and funding for the Office of Outdoor Recreation. The motion includes $5 million for Taliesin Preservation Inc. for restoration projects at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin home located in Spring Green supporting private fundraising for an education center, the restoration of visitor amenities and the stabilization of some buildings.
$193,700 to the Wisconsin Elections Commission with over $150,000 of that going toward information technology costs and the remaining going towards costs for the Electronic Registration Information Center.
$20.9 million and 147 positions for 12 months of personnel related costs for a Milwaukee Type 1 facility, which is meant to serve as a portion of the replacement of youth prisons Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, which the state had been working to close for years. The 32-bed facility in Milwaukee has a planned completion date in October 2026.
The WisconsinEye endowment received $10 million to continue video coverage of the Legislature.
The committee also approved $11 million for grants to nine of Wisconsin’s 11 federally-recognized tribes. The committee has been excluding two tribes — the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa — from the grant funding for several years due to disputes over roads. The exclusion “strikes me as inappropriate,” McGuire said. He added that it’s “an insult to those people.”

The worker’s attorneys believe their client was the first of the detained Glenn Valley employees to be released on a bond pending further legal proceedings. Other bond hearings are expected over the next days and weeks, they and other attorneys working with the group said.

The next step for the released foreign-born worker is to build a case for eligibility to remain in the country, said Bassel El-Kasaby, who said attorney Lauren Schmoke in the Kasaby Schmoke law firm represented the person in immigration court proceedings. El-Kasaby said final resolution of such cases can take years, given the court’s backlog.
El-Kasaby said the firm’s client was not charged with a criminal act. He said the client is accused of a civil offense, entering and working in the U.S. without authorization, which can lead to penalties such as deportation. The law firm declined to provide more detail without the client’s consent. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the June 10 operation stemmed from a federal criminal search warrant looking for more than 100 individuals who ICE alleges stole U.S. identities.
According to available federal court records, it appears that so far three of the detained workers have been criminally charged — one for allegedly using a Social Security number of a U.S. citizen. The other two: a Honduran man accused of brandishing a box cutter and resisting arrest; a Mexican man facing charges for re-entering the country after being previously departed.
An ICE spokeswoman said the investigation continues.
Another four people face criminal charges related to protests during the raid.
Anne Wurth, senior attorney at Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said her nonprofit is handling several of the worker cases. She said the bulk will have hearings over the next couple of weeks in immigration court to set a potential bond and future court dates for civil offenses.
“The majority of these people are not facing criminal charges at this time,” she said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.


“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I may be best-known for my battles with pipeline companies, both Summit Carbon’s proposed carbon dioxide pipeline and the Dakota Access oil pipeline. I had the distinction of being named first in the landowners’ lawsuit against Summit’s efforts to force their way onto our land, which wound its way to the state Supreme Court, where we prevailed last year. 
It’s well-established that many South Dakotans do not care for the carbon dioxide pipeline, but the U.S. House’s budget reconciliation bill fails to repeal a massive handout to carbon companies with 45Q tax credits. This corporate welfare is why companies like Summit persist in pushing projects we don’t want. Our lone representative, Congressman Dusty Johnson, voted yes on the bill. It’s now under consideration in the Senate. 
He touted all the reasons this “big, beautiful bill” will be good for South Dakota, but good for whom, exactly? He doesn’t mention billions of dollars in 45Q tax credits at all, but cheerfully explains reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. He seems quite proud of the cuts and work requirements that will leave more South Dakotans hungry and lacking in health care. Not to mention the negative impacts on our grocery stores and small health care facilities. 
Trump urges voters to press for US Senate GOP mega-bill after setback on Medicaid cuts

As a pipeline fighter, folks may be surprised at my concern over cuts to food assistance and health care access, but I taught for over 30 years in our public schools, so I understand how budgets affect people’s lives. I also have direct experience with helping disabled people acquire that designation, and let me tell you, that is a difficult and lengthy process. It may take years for people who are not able to work to be recognized as disabled by the government. These cuts will be devastating for them. 
So when I hear that these budget cuts will help reduce waste and fraud, I call foul. Currently over 75,000 South Dakotans utilize SNAP, so these cuts will be felt everywhere. The work requirements may sound like common sense until you dig in. The cut-off age for a dependent child is 7 years; what this means is that if you are a parent on SNAP, you must work 20 hours per week if your youngest child is 7 or older, whether or not you have child care or how far you have to drive to get to that job. Or even if there is a job to be had.
We all know people’s budgets are tight, and this is reflected by Feeding South Dakota, which has reported a 15% increase in usage over last year. They are already struggling to meet people’s needs, so what will happen if these cuts are implemented? Hunger is what will happen. 
Next, let’s consider our state budget, which had to be trimmed this past legislative session. The U.S. House version of the budget reconciliation bill would make South Dakota absorb a reported $9 million to $18 million in costs shifted to the states as early as 2028 in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Can we tighten our belts that much? 
If all this weren’t enough, let’s look at how health care would be hurt by the Medicaid cuts. Nearly 150,000 South Dakotans are enrolled in Medicaid, and many of these folks are senior citizens and people with disabilities. If fewer people can be covered, our health care facilities will feel the pinch immediately because even though people may not have coverage, they still get sick and injured. 
As for how this will impact hospitals and clinics, this quote from Shelley Ten Napel in South Dakota Searchlight on May 29 says it best: “The proposed cuts will be especially harmful to rural South Dakota. When coverage rates fall, rural health centers lose critical funding – putting access to primary care, maternal care, dental services and behavioral health at risk for everyone in those communities.” 
Thousands of South Dakotans already travel considerable distances for a doctor’s visit, and these cuts will make a bad situation worse if closures start. Plus, those are jobs lost from communities, another blow. 
I don’t think this bill is as beautiful as Rep. Johnson makes it out to be. The pipeline companies got a rosy deal, but it looks pretty ugly for the rest of us.

(Getty Images)As voters prepare to decide who the state’s next governor should be, nearly half of respondents to a new Rutgers-Eagleton Poll say the state is headed in the wrong direction.
The poll found that 48% of residents say New Jersey is on the wrong track compared to 39% who say it is headed in the right direction. Fourteen percent are unsure. 
Results differed widely depending on the respondent’s political party. Sixty-three percent of Democrats said the state is headed in the right direction versus 77% of Republicans saying it’s on the wrong track. Unaffiliated voters are on the pessimistic side, with 48% saying the state is on the wrong track and 32% saying it’s moving in the right direction. 
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is stepping down in January after two terms as governor. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are competing in November to succeed him. 
Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of Rutgers’ Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said the right track/wrong track gap is the widest it’s been since March 2022. A poll from that month found 48% of New Jerseyans saying the state was going in the right direction and 45% saying it had gone off track.
“We’ve kind of seen this very middle-of-the-road kind of malaise of an outlook from New Jerseyans for quite a prolonged period of time now, really dipping down since the pandemic,” Koning told the New Jersey Monitor. 
Predictably, economic issues topped respondents’ concerns when asked about the most important problem facing New Jersey. Thirty-six percent cited taxes and 22% said affordability and the cost of living, while housing affordability and the economy were cited by 8% each. 
The last time New Jersey voters had a governor’s race with no incumbent seeking reelection was 2017, when Murphy was running to succeed Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican wrapping up two terms as governor. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from August 2017 revealed deep dissatisfaction among New Jersey voters, with 74% saying the state was on the wrong track versus 16% who said it was going in the right direction.
Though Sherrill’s campaign has criticized Ciattarelli for being too friendly to President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, and Ciattarelli has griped about overdevelopment of the state’s suburbs, economic issues widely eclipsed both as the most important problem facing New Jersey, the new poll shows. Trump, the federal government, and MAGA ideology were cited by just 3%, with 1% citing overdevelopment.
“Even when we see these critical social issues pop up and become more salient, they’re still, at the end of the day, perhaps not the most important or the biggest driving factor,” Koning said. “That’s how Ciattarelli ended up closing his gap in 2021 as well, by focusing on economic issues, and why the gubernatorial was so close.”
Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021 and came within three points of unseating Murphy.
Results are from a statewide poll of 621 adults selected randomly and surved between June 13 and June 16.

The Legislature plans to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
The post Agreement reached on state budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE LEGISLATURE PLANS to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Sen. Michael Rodrigues, the budget chiefs for each chamber, said in a statement just after 1 p.m. Friday they completed a deal on the annual spending plan. They did not release any details about its contents or even a bottom line spending figure.
Each branch this spring approved a more than $61.4 billion budget, representing a roughly 6 percent increase in state spending over the version Gov. Maura Healey signed last summer.
While the bottom lines were roughly similar, the House and Senate budgets differed on how much money to provide to the MBTA, other education and transportation initiatives funded by a surtax on wealthy households, the use of one-time revenues to support spending, and transfers to the health safety net program.
“With this compromise agreement, the House and Senate are doubling down on our shared commitment to addressing the underlying budget challenges that we are collectively confronting in the face of ongoing uncertainty and federal funding impacts,” Michlewitz and Rodrigues said in a joint statement. “Currently, our teams are working hard to complete the work necessary to file the conference committee report this weekend, to ensure that the Legislature is prepared to act on Monday to send a balanced and fiscally responsible budget to the Governor and her team before the beginning of the new fiscal year.”
Lawmakers also packed the bills with policy riders, and the weekend filing will reveal how they landed on whether to pause admissions reforms at vocational and technical schools, whether to give up some state control over alcohol licenses, and whether regulators can cap prices for some prescription medications.
The House and Senate are largely pressing ahead with spending plans crafted before the extent of changes at the federal level became more apparent.
Final approval of the state budget is now likely to occur before Congress completes its work on a massive spending, tax and policy bill. That legislation remains pending in the US Senate.
If Republicans in Washington, DC, follow through on their goals of cutting spending on Medicaid and other programs, it could force Gov. Maura Healey to make significant changes to the state budget down the line.
Fiscal year 2026 begins Tuesday, July 1. Massachusetts has not had a new state budget signed into law before the start of the fiscal year in a decade and a half.
Michlewitz and Rodrigues’s announcement tees up legislative approval of a new budget on fiscal new year’s eve, though the state is almost certain not to have a spending plan officially in place by the time FY 2026 begins because Healey gets 10 days to review any bill sent to her desk.
Healey on Monday filed a $7.5 billion interim budget designed to keep state government funded, and avoid any lapses in paychecks, programs or services, for about another month in the absence of an annual spending plan. The Legislature broke for a long weekend without taking up that stopgap measure.
Spokespeople for both House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka said Friday their branches will approve the interim budget Monday.
If the Legislature enacts the fiscal 2026 budget Monday as planned, it would be the earliest in the calendar lawmakers sent an annual budget to the governor since 2016, when they also voted on June 30.
House and Senate Democrats for years have extended budget talks into the new fiscal year and kept government funded with holdover budgets, at times producing some of the latest annual budgets in the nation.
The last time a governor signed an annual state budget into law before the start of the fiscal year was in 2010.
The difference in spending between the House and Senate budgets is $70.3 million or about 0.11 percent, the Mass. Taxpayers Foundation said before cautioning that there is also nearly $1 billion in unique spending across the two bills especially in areas like health care, education, support services and economic development.
“The House budget includes $437 million in spending not reflected in the Senate budget, while the Senate budget includes $522 million in spending not adopted by the House,” MTF said in a report last week.
MTF said that the six-person conference committee, should it attempt to fund every dollar called for in the House and Senate budgets, could find itself as much as $769 million short if budget-writers have only MTF’s minimum estimate for budget revenues available to them.
“At a high-level, the House and Senate budgets share many similarities that would ordinarily suggest swift conference resolution: both bills exclude the tax policy proposals put forward by the administration, spend less than the Governor by at least $500 million, and reflect a limited number of substantive policy proposals,” the report said. “However, despite these shared elements, budget conferees are still tasked with reconciling nearly $1 billion in unique spending priorities, a resource gap that could exceed $750 million, and notable policy differences related to pharmaceutical cost controls and admissions policies at vocational technical high schools.”
The budget deal is the first piece of legislation subject to newly reformed joint rules the House and Senate adopted Thursday. One provision in the new package requires a gap of at least 24 hours between the filing of a conference report and acceptance of it in the House and Senate, which would require the budget deal to be submitted to the House clerk’s office by about Sunday afternoon for action to take place Monday.
Under the new rules, if a report is filed later than 8 p.m. though, it cannot be considered the following day.

My first encounter with Montana Congressman Pat Williams was at a political event I was covering in Pocatello, Idaho in the early 1980s.
Williams, who died this week in Missoula, Montana at age 87, was speaking at that event. He delivered the best political stump speech I had ever heard.
I haven’t heard a better one since. It was an unabashed defense of enduring democratic values – respect for the Constitution, defense of a liberal education, support for working women and men and organized labor, an affirmation that good people in government can and must do good works.
It is said that Montana, a state I love for its beauty, its people and (until recently) its determinedly independent political nature, is really a small town with a very long Main Street. If you spend some time under the Big Sky you come to believe that virtually everyone in the fourth largest (by square mile) state in the Union knows everyone else. And it’s almost true.
Driving 200 miles to have dinner with friends or to watch a football game is pretty routine in Montana. Voters (until recently) knew their governor, U.S. senators and congressmen on a first name basis because those Montanans showed up to knock on doors, eat chicken dinners, hold town hall meetings and give local reporters interviews.
That has changed. A lot.
Pat Williams’ passing reminds me of just how much things have changed, and damn it is not for the better in any way.
Pat Williams was among the very last of a breed of Montana congressional figures who knew more about their state than they knew about Georgetown, and by that I mean the neighborhood in the District of Columbia and not the spot on the map of Deer Lodge County.
Mike Mansfield, the best Senate majority leader in history, was just “Mike” to his Montana constituents. Mansfield campaigned in coffee shops and held office hours in the Oxford in Missoula.
“Lee” was the champion of the Wilderness Act and presided over the Senate during the filibuster that tried, unsuccessfully, to defeat the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Senator Metcalf, appropriately, has a Wilderness area that carries his name.
“Max” was the guy who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and served in the Senate longer than any other Montanan. For decades Senator Baucus shaped fiscal and health care policy and then, like Mansfield, had a second act as a U.S. ambassador to Asia.
There are many others: B.K. Wheeler, a Montanan who lead the fight to prevent the Supreme Court from becoming Franklin Roosevelt’s court; Tom Walsh, the investigator of Teapot Dome from Helena; Jeannette Rankin, an advocate for women and peace who hailed from Missoula, and Jim Murray, a millionaire New Deal liberal from Butte whose political devotion was to Montana’s miners and farmers.
Until partisan polarization poisoned Montana’s politics just as it has poisoned the country, Big Sandy farmer Jon Tester, as authentic and decent as any of those just noted, was the last best Montana federal office holder in this long and now gone tradition.
  Now let us praise Pat Williams 

Pat once told me he caught more political grief for advocating changing the name of the Custer Battlefield than anything he did in Congress, but he did it. Pat, a student of history and hyper sensitive to injustice, didn’t think the racist loser in that celebrated battle deserved the honor. Now we call it the Little Bighorn.
We take it for granted now, but the Family and Medical Leave Act likely would not have happened without Pat Williams shifting the legislative gears.
He advocated for the arts and humanities when Newt Gingrich – echos of today – came after the national endowments, arguing that art and ideas could exist without democracy but democracy was imperiled when creativity and critical thinking where ignored. Pat saw the effort to eliminate the endowments for just what it was, and what it is again – censorship.
Interviewed by The Washington Post, Pat characterized the struggle to pass compromise legislation to save federal funding for the arts in the 1990s as “the most nasty, difficult and thoroughly enjoyable of my life.”
Pat said of that fight:

        Art reflects the diversity and pluralism of our society, which is free. And freedom is our bulwark against tyranny. You can burn a generation’s imagination by teaching them that art is something to fear.    
As Democrats wander in the political wilderness trying to figure out how to “appeal” to distracted, disinterested voters, they might go to school on the politics of Pat Williams. He listened. He showed up. He cared. He knew what he believed.
“He was always his authentic self,” pollster Celinda Lake said. “He told me, ‘I want you to know my goals. I’m engaged in a 20-year conversation with the people of Montana about the benefits of good public education and the dangers of hard-rock mining.’ And I’ll never forget that.”
Like so many politicians who have tasted the bitter fruit of what our politics have become, Williams knew that big money and poll tested positions are a huge problem. In a 1996 interview with the New York Times he put his finger squarely on our dangerous national dilemma.

“People have come to believe their elected officials and their candidates are not the real McCoy. They’re not authentic, they’re scripted, talking according to the polls, voting according to next November … It’s cancerous to our system.”
 

Williams wasn’t bashful about advocating for the public’s lands and cleaner environment. 
He knew from experience as a teacher and elected official that education was still the best and surest path to a better life. He wrote well, really well. Pat’s sense of humor – he was from Butte and had to have a sense of humor – was legendary. He was the best political story teller I’ve ever shared a dinner and a drink with.
When my much better half was working on her doctorate – her subject was women and leadership – Pat enthusiastically supported her research, and every single time I called him or shared a handshake and a hug he would say, “And, how is Dr. Johnson?”
Years ago the journalist turned U.S. Sen. Richard Neuberger wrote an essay about a now long forgotten politician who gained power and fame and then couldn’t remember where he came from. As Neuberger told the story he got off a train, the City of Portland, to stretch his legs and asked the ticket agent how he could locate a former politician he’d once known.
“Heck mister,” the man said, “he don’t live here any more. Those guys never come back to Pocatello.”
But Pat did come back – to Montana. He taught and the University of Montana, and researched, and mentored and spoke out about issues big and small. He never caught the fever associated with the Potomac, instead preferring the Clark Fork. He loved and cared about Montana, all of it.
About the only truly bad thing I can say about Pat Williams is that he was a fan of the New York Yankees, admittedly a small blemish on a thoroughly distinguished resume.
There is a lot to be said for decency and authenticity in public life. A lot to be said for knowing what you stand for and then having the guts to explain why to the people who vote.
These increasingly rare qualities defined the gentleman from Montana. Finding another like him under the Big Sky seems now all but impossible, but I suspect Pat, with the optimism of a guy from Butte, would say: Keep the faith, do the work, show up and care.
God, I will miss him. I will never forget Pat Williams and all he did. We are very lucky that he made us all better.

,California,2025-06-28 13:10:00+00:00,CalMatters,Marines are now stationed on the California border. Newsom’s office calls it ‘mission creep’,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/06/marines-border-patrol/,"As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it's sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border.","In summary
As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it’s sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border. 


Dozens of Marines are now stationed at a Border Patrol station in eastern San Diego County, a new development that points to the Trump administration’s military buildup on the southern border.
Some Marines there told CalMatters on Wednesday that they are out in Campo patrolling the border twice a day.  
That’s a change from how Marines have operated in Southern California since President Trump took office. Until now, Marines have been limited to a supporting role, adhering to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which keeps the armed forces away from civilian law enforcement. 
But Trump has long hinted at using the armed forces in unprecedented ways at the border to deal with what he describes as “an invasion.” 
And recently, the Trump administration shifted immigration enforcement northward toward the interior of California. Border Patrol agents have been seen chasing farmworkers through strawberry fields in Oxnard and swarming workers in unmarked cars at bus stops in inner-city Los Angeles.  
The Marines have not disclosed detaining anyone in California. Active-duty Army soldiers patrolling the border in New Mexico earlier this month reported turning people over to immigration authorities, a change that illustrated escalating immigration enforcement by military service members. 
A spokesperson for the Joint Task Force Southern Border, in charge of the operation, did not return a request for comment. Border Patrol Agent Gerardo Gutierrez said the Marines “are just staging there for their assistance along the border,” and gave no further details. 
California officials and immigration experts do not have details on what the Marines are doing at the border.  
“It’s not clear to me what instructions the Marines are being given with respect to engagement with people who are attempting to cross the border,” said Kevin Johnson, a UC Davis School of Law professor whose work focuses on immigration and civil rights. 
In April, Trump declared a 60-foot-wide strip of federal land that runs the length of the entire border as a “military installation,” a status meant to allow troops to patrol the region in the same way they protect military bases.

On a recent trip to the Border Patrol site in Campo, CalMatters reporters observed Marines’ olive-colored tents pitched atop hot asphalt with nearby water tanks for brushing teeth and washing. They have a pile of MREs, or “meals-ready-to-eat,” for food. 
Their camp is a couple of hundred yards from the start of the Pacific Coast Trail — a stone’s throw from the U.S.-Mexico border. The area is very remote.
Newsom sued to stop LA deployments
Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom clashed with Trump over the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles and deployment of U.S. Marines to subdue protesters, calling it “an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.” Newsom sued the administration, but a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the president had followed the law and the case is unfolding at a lower court. 
A spokesperson for Newsom in a written statement to CalMatters connected the Marines at Campo to the Trump administration sending Border Patrol agents hundreds of miles inland.
“We believe in strong border security, but this campaign is not about security—it’s about fear,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo of Newsom’s office. 
“Now it appears Marines are being forced to backfill those border slots,” she continued. “This is not just mission creep—it’s putting law enforcement, our soldiers, and the community in danger.”
The military presence in Campo, previously unreported, follows an earlier deployment of roughly 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton, who had been positioned in the small coastal town of Imperial Beach and in an inland border area near Brown Field Airport in Otay Mesa. According to the Department of Defense, those troops are tasked with “detection, monitoring, logistics, and transportation support along the border.” 
Over the last three decades, the border has become one of the most militarized regions in the world, with stronger, more formidable, and taller border barriers and increased surveillance. Migrant deaths have increased as people sought more dangerous routes in the U.S., the Mexican government reported last month.
How Trump’s border mission differs from others
When he took office, Trump issued a series of executive orders, including a national emergency declaration, to achieve what he described as “full operational control” of the southern border. The orders directed the Department of Defense, through U.S. Northern Command, to bolster border enforcement through increased military involvement. 
Some legal experts say turning land along the border into a “military installation” may sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically bars federal armed forces from conducting domestic law enforcement.

“There’s a concern that armed troops may use deadly force in situations and that people may be injured,” said Johnson, adding that military forces don’t have experience dealing with vulnerable migrants, and it’s not clear what training they’ve received. 
“It’s like a ticking time bomb,” he added. “I hate to say it this way, but it’s only a matter of time until we see something bad happen.” 
This isn’t the first time U.S. troops have been sent to the border. The Department of Defense has deployed troops to the border under both Republican and Democratic administrations for construction and surveillance.  But until now, their role has been limited to conducting surveillance, repairing vehicles, and fortifying barriers. 
The latest wave of deployments brings the total number of military personnel supporting the Border Patrol’s mission at the Mexico border to more than 10,000 – adding to the approximately 2,500 who were already stationed along the entire length of the 2,000-mile border. The number of troops at the border fluctuates as the units rotate and additional forces are mobilized, according to the Defense Department.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062525-Marines-Camp-AD-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-28 10:01:09.422113

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYO. – Sitting in an old-growth spruce fir forest, Doug Smith says he can see first-hand the impact of reintroducing wolves on the larger ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park.

Long before Yellowstone became the world’s first national park in 1872, wolves thrived in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
But early Yellowstone rangers killed off the last of the park’s wolves by 1926. By the late 1930s, the federal government had basically eradicated all the wolves in the American West.
That fundamentally changed the ecosystem, as far as Smith is concerned.
“To me it was just pretty scenery because it wasn’t ecologically vibrant,” Smith said.
Then, in 1995, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Idaho and Yellowstone using wolves captured in Canada.
Smith helped bring them back to the park and was in charge of Yellowstone’s wolf project for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Yellowstone is a very different place, with and without wolves,” Smith said.
“Wolves definitely have changed this landscape with the help of other predators,” he added. “It’s very different.”
Many of the changes have to do with the wolves’ status as an apex predator, at the top of the food chain. With the loss of wolves and the decline of other predators like cougar and grizzly bears, elk populations surged, Smith said.

Without the threat of wolves throughout much of the 20th century, the elk devoured woody vegetation in Yellowstone, like willows and stands of white bark Aspen trees.
When wolves were reintroduced, they preyed on elk, which reduced the number of elk and put pressure on the remaining animals to keep moving and not graze as long or as heavily in one place.
“I go to willow stands and aspen stands now that I was in 30 years ago, and literally, every single stem was eaten by an elk, and it was at the level of your knee,” Smith said. “And now I go in those stands, and you can lose your partner in them in regrowth of vegetation within 10 feet.”
Scientists debate an effect called the trophic cascade, which deals with how ecosystems are constructed and describes the cascading impact a predator has on its prey further down the food chain.
“Why it’s interesting is when European settlers moved across North America, they killed all the predators,” Smith said. “So you’ve really disrupted this process of a trophic cascade.”
Smith said the debate over the effects of the trophic cascade gets complicated – quickly. He himself falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to buying into the impact and intensity of the effect. But as Smith backpacked near Cache Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone, he said the impact of wolves and other predators is easy to spot.
“You guys don’t have to be ecologists to see all these Aspen are young,” Smith said. “Within a few years – and, man, give them 20 or 30 (years) – you’re going to have a forest here, and we’re going to be standing in the shade. Totally different ballgame, and I think that’s restoring balance to the ecosystem.”
When vegetation grows back, as the aspen and willows grow tall, that impacts things like beaver populations, which Smith has documented, and even songbirds.
The big picture for Smith? Wolves restored balance that was missing from Yellowstone’s ecosystem when the predators were absent.
“It’s a nice story, too,” Smith said. “We ruined Yellowstone. We’re fixing it by bringing back the top carnivores, most notably wolves.”
Truth be told, most Yellowstone visitors have likely never heard of the trophic cascade or deeply  considered the wolves’ impact on the food chain and the larger ecosystem.
But like the ecosystem, wolves have a powerful effect on many people, too.
Reintroducing wolves also attracted a new crop of tourists hoping to see a wolf in the wild. And that has had a cascading effect on the local economy.
Wolf-watching tourism has an estimated $80 million total economic impact on the communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park.
Any visitor to the wolves’ stronghold in the park, the Lamar Valley, can see the impact in the many tourists dotting hillsides looking through binoculars and spotting scopes hoping to spot canis lupus in the wild.
And one wolf, in particular, fascinated wolf watchers for longer than almost any other.
 907: the one-eyed queen of Yellowstone wolves

Even from a great distance, the old wolf’s large size and limp gave her identity away.
Gray, with a black nose, white legs, a cream-colored belly and a black spot near the base of her tail, wolf 907F stood out from the pack.
907’s physical scars told the silent story of the struggles wolves endure fighting for control of the rugged Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park.
Aside from a limp in her front paw, 907 was missing her left eye, the result of an injury park officials first noticed in 2017.

“Whatever tragedy, setback or loss she has, she just keeps on moving forward,” said Rick McIntyre, a retired Yellowstone National Park ranger and author who has studied 907’s pack since it formed.

“Nothing (stops her) – not health problems, getting beat up by a rival, the loss of her mother, the loss of her father, loss of pups,” McIntyre said.
Nobody in the world has seen more wolves in the wild than McIntyre.
He started working at Yellowstone in 1994 as an interpretive wolf ranger and documented his 100,000th wolf sighting in 2019.
Because he has 30 years of experience documenting wolves on a nearly daily basis, it takes a lot for a wolf to stand out to McIntyre.

But 907 accomplished something rare.
She was able to rise to the rank of alpha female four separate times and control one of the largest wolf packs ever documented in Yellowstone. And while she was at it, 907  gave birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone and outlasted her rivals long enough to grow old in the wild.
In 2024, 907 turned 11 years old and continued to lead hunts for bison and elk as the oldest wolf in the national park.
By comparison, the average wolf lives for about three or four years in Yellowstone, McIntyre said. Even pet dogs that sleep indoors, receive veterinary care and have a bowl of food waiting for them twice a day don’t always make it to 11.
Because of her longevity and the fact that researchers put a radio collar on her when she was a pup, Yellowstone biologists and wolf watchers were able to study 907 so closely for so long that there are detailed numbers and statistics documenting much of her life.
For her to reach the age of 11, 907 had to defend her territory from rival wolves and endure 10 snowy, freezing Wyoming winters. She had to fight for most of her meals – sometimes getting kicked in the head by 2,000-pound bison and sent flying through the air.
Her stats are a snapshot of the turbulent life wild wolves face. Throughout her life, Yellowstone National Park staff watched 907 participate in 566 hunts.
Most of the time she chased bison (281 hunts) or elk (239 times).
She was successful 33 times, or in about 6% of the hunts that park officials documented.
Yellowstone officials once watched 907 and the Junction Butte Pack endure 12 days without finding anything to eat – only for the pack to triumphantly bring down a bull elk on empty stomachs.
When it comes to numbers, the biggest impact 907 may have had was building up the bloodline of Yellowstone wolves.
In 2024, at the age of 11, she produced her 10th litter of pups.
That is the most for any wolf in 30 years of wolf research at Yellowstone National Park.
“With her being 11 years old and having new pups that would be somewhat similar to a woman in her mid 80s having kids,” McIntyre said.
Numbers even tell the story of how 907 got her name.
When Yellowstone officials captured 907 and placed a radio collar around her neck in 2013, she got collar No. 907.
Each collar has a unique number to help identify and tell the wolves apart. Biologists use the “F” in 907F to designate her as female, but many people simply called her 907.
The collar allowed park officials to keep close tabs on 907 for more than a decade.
Many of the numbers and statistics about 907 can be found online in the 2024 Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar and Elk Project annual report, as well as previous yearly wolf reports.
 The chance to observe a wolf queen’s long reign attracts tourists to Yellowstone National Park

Wolf 907 and the Junction Butte Pack’s territory spanned mountains, valleys and creeks within an area called the Lamar Valley, which is in the northern part of Yellowstone National Park on the Wyoming-Montana border. It’s one of the centers of wildlife activity in the park.
For years, 907 dug her den into a hillside covered by a mix of sagebrush and conifer trees overlooking Slough Creek, where 907 and her pack hunted bison and elk.



On a chilly July morning in 2024, the creek meandered through a giant meadow below the den, where bison wallowed as the morning sun crested the nearby mountain peaks.
The den was a mile or more from the closest road, near the top of a diagonal section of forest.
Toward the left side of the forest, barely visible to the naked eye from more than a mile away, stood four small clusters of conifer trees.
At the base of one of the trees, near a patch of light colored dirt, 907 wrestled with two pups, one gray and one black
Unbeknownst to 907, she was often the object of attention from afar.
And on that morning in July a handful of people with high-powered scopes were watching her every move.
One of the wolf watchers was Laurie Lyman, a schoolteacher originally from California.

Lyman became interested in wolves after realizing that third and fourth graders became more interested in learning about continents if Lyman described the animals that lived there.
One year, Lyman received a copy of Jim Dutcher’s 1997 Emmy Award-winning documentary “Wolves at Our Door,” which Lyman and her students promptly fell in love with.
Something about wolves – how they live in packs that function like a family, where all of the wolves help raise the pups, contribute to hunting and share food – made an immediate impression on Lyman.
Within wolf packs, including 907’s own Junction Butte Pack, biologists have even documented one wolf raising another wolf’s pups. One spring, 907 had a litter of eight pups. Other female members of the Junction Butte Pack who lost their own litters helped 907 raise her large litter  – even taking turns nursing the pups.
Before reintroduction, Lyman was fascinated by the ways the members of wolf packs worked together to take care of each other.
But wolves had been absent from the landscape in the U.S. Rocky Mountains for her entire life, and Lyman assumed she would never see a wolf in the wild.
That’s how wolf reintroduction changed Lyman’s life.
After wolves were reintroduced in 1995, Lyman started hearing about people seeing wild wolves again and she made a trip to see what it was all about.
“When they released them into Yellowstone, when they started to see them, it was incredible, and that was the changing point in my life,” Lyman said.
Lyman retired from teaching in 2005 and bought a house in Montana just outside of Yellowstone’s Northeast Entrance to be closer to wolves.
She became friends with then-Yellowstone Ranger Rick McIntyre and purchased a spotting scope. And for the past 20 years, Lyman has been watching wolves and documenting her sightings online at www.yellowstonereports.com.
Now, she thinks of wolves and wolf packs a lot like students and classrooms.
“It’s very similar to actually teaching my kids, watching the wolves out,” Lyman said. “It’s like watching a recess. Because you have the adults sleeping. And you have the yearlings playing.  And you have the pups and it’s very much like kids in a sandbox, kids playing soccer. And then the older kids sitting in the lunch center talking.”
“My thing is getting to know them on an individual basis, so that I can easily recognize them,” Lyman added.
 If you come at the queen, you best not miss

Thanks to their notes and years of daily field observations, McIntyre and Lyman have major details of 907’s life documented.
Even as a pup, 907 didn’t have it easy.
She was born in 2013, the second year of the Junction Butte Pack’s existence. Before the year was over, 907’s mother died or disappeared, McIntyre said. About that same time, 907’s father, wolf 911, took off, returning to the original wolf pack that he had been born into.
“In human terms, you could say that she was orphaned,” McIntyre said. “However, she was raised by the pack, raised by the family.”
After she became an adult, 907 fought with her twin sister, wolf 969, for control of the Junction Butte Pack.
The two sisters regularly pinned each other to the ground and bit at each other, Lyman said.
“And they went back and forth several times on who had the alpha female position,” McIntyre said. “907 would have it for a while, the sister would take it away from her and then 907 would get it back.”
In 2017, 907 had a litter of pups and made her den in a remote location away from the rest of the Junction Butte Pack.
Park officials and wolf watchers noticed that the other adults in the pack stayed away from the den and didn’t appear to bring food to 907 or her pups.
In May, 907 returned to the pack, but her pups had died.
“And to make it worse, while she was desperately trying to save her pups, her sister at the time, 969, took advantage of that situation to seize the alpha position,” McIntyre said. “And when 907 rejoined the pack after losing all of her pups, she was beaten up by her sister and relegated to a very lowly position in the pack.”
“Everything that year was against her,” McIntyre said.
Even though she was relegated to a subordinate role, 907 didn’t leave the pack.
“She just has this ability to keep on moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past, dwelling on how unfair life has been,” McIntyre said.
During the 2019-20 winter, the Junction Butte Pack experienced a bloody leadership shakeup.
The female wolves aggressively drove 969 – 907’s sister and rival – out of the pack.
Wolf 969 survived her initial expulsion, but park officials noticed she appeared to be in poor physical condition.
A few weeks after her exile, 969 encountered the Junction Butte Pack again one January night, leading to a fight.
“The next morning 969F was seen with injuries and she died later that day,” officials wrote in the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 2020 annual report. “Her injuries were caused by other wolves and she weighed only 33 kilograms (73 pounds).”
Even after her sister and closest rival was killed, 907 continued to face challenges from rival female wolves.
First, it was her sister’s daughter, wolf 1382, who became a problem for 907.
Then wolf 1262 took over as the pack’s alpha female.
Finally it was wolf 1276.
But after 1276 was last seen alive in October 2023, 907 again took her crown as the Junction Butte Pack’s alpha female.
“And this is her fourth term as alpha female, meaning that she lost it three times,” McIntyre said. “And in those cases, it was either to a sister or a niece. So she’s had a lot of hard times in her life, and she’s always been able to fight back and prevail.”
From 2016 to 2024, 907 claimed the rank of alpha female four separate times.
And she gave birth to pups every spring from 2015 to 2024.

For those reasons, Lyman views 907 as the stabilizing force in the Junction Butte Pack and one of her favorite wolves of all time.
“She would just put her head down and walk into the wind no matter what adversity came to her,” Lyman said.
 Ambushed in the dark, a queen makes her last stand in Yellowstone

Despite her long rivalry with her sister, it turns out 907’s greatest threat came from outside her own pack.
It was just before Christmas 2024 when 907 made her last stand.
During the final few weeks of 2024, the Junction Butte Pack left the invisible, unfenced boundary of Yellowstone National Park and entered Montana, where hunting season was underway.
From Dec. 17 through Dec. 19, hunters legally killed two other adult members of the Junction Butte Pack outside of the park, Yellowstone officials wrote.
After the shootings, 907 and some of the surviving members of the Junction Butte Pack returned to their home territory in the Lamar Valley inside of Yellowstone.

But the Junction Butte Pack’s numbers were reduced. Lyman said there were only six other wolves with 907 when the final battle went down – and one or two of them may have been pups.

A much larger force of 19 wolves from a different wolf pack, the Rescue Creek Pack, ambushed 907 and the Junction Butte Pack on Dec. 22 after wolf watchers spotted the diminished Junction Butte Pack feeding on an animal carcass.
The attack occurred at night.
Lyman wasn’t there, but she received a phone call from a friend who was.
“She was filming and her camera lights things up so she could see things pretty well,” Lyman said. “She called me and she said, ‘You know, it’s over. They got her.’”
The radio collar 907 was wearing was designed to enter mortality mode and emit a unique signal after several hours passed without any movement from the wolf. Officials didn’t detect a mortality signal from 907 until about three days after the attack, Lyman said.

Lyman was heartbroken thinking about 907 suffering at the end.
It may be impossible to know exactly what went down in the dark woods after the Rescue Creek Pack advanced on 907 and the Junction Butte Pack.
But this much seems certain.
907 went out fighting.
She died fighting a larger, rival wolf pack that had attacked her and the Junction Butte Pack – the family she lived with her entire life with.
No other members of the Junction Butte Pack died in the attack from the Rescue Creek wolves.
That means 907’s pack, including some of her pups and nieces, lived on without her.
Strange as it sounds, Lyman takes comfort in that.
Despite the sadness, people like Lyman were happy that 907 lived and died naturally, as wolves did before humans became a factor.
At least 907 wasn’t shot by hunters, like 15 other members of the Junction Butte Pack who were killed when they strayed outside of the park’s boundaries, Lyman said.
The same week 907 died, her counterpart, the alpha male of the Junction Butte Pack, was killed by a poacher. The alpha male, who did not have a number or a radio collar, was killed Dec. 24, while the wolf was outside of Yellowstone National Park, in Montana.
After living to be the fifth-oldest wolf ever recorded in Yellowstone and having more litters of pups than any Yellowstone wolf since the species was reintroduced 30 years ago, 907 went out fighting.
“This is a wolf in the wild, and this is what wolves do,” Lyman said. “They’re wired to rise to the top to survive, and this is what they have to do to do it.”
“She just did what she had to do to make sure that her pack survived,” Lyman said. “So to me, she is a key to the Junctions surviving until now. And her legacy is in those three females that are left there in the pack.”
That’s one of the gifts of a wolf, Lyman said.
“Just like a regular family does, you pass down what you know and help them learn to survive. And she really did that.”

Poll findings released this week from Glengarrif Group showed that eight in 10 voters – from a sample size of 800 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.5% – felt that the upcoming election to select the three top heads of state; governor, attorney general and secretary of state, would be equally secure and fair. 
The results of the poll, which was conducted during the first week of June, were released in conjunction with an event on Thursday at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. The panel featured members of the Democracy Defense Project, including two former Michigan governors, a former congressman and others.
Glengarrif Group noted that nearly 76% of Michigan voters said the November 2024 election was fair, and that 88% of voters said they trusted their local elections, which is a 10-percentage point increase from those who answered a related poll in October 2024.
That said, nearly 57% of voters who engaged with the poll said they were at least somewhat concerned about noncitizens voting in state elections, with nearly 36% also saying they were very concerned about that issue.
Only 21% of respondents, however, said voters should show an ID to vote, which is already required by Michigan law, and a slim 7.7% said voters should show proof of citizenship.
That polling on some voters’ feelings on citizenship as a prerequisite to vote serves as a counterpoint to Michigan Republican efforts to get a constitutional amendment requiring proof of citizenship in order to cast a ballot.
The lead sponsor of that movement is state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford), who told Michigan Advance in late May that he believed 85% of the state’s population agreed that only U.S. citizens should vote in statewide and national elections.
That said, Posthumus’ aim was to put that question before the voters in 2026, giving the voting populace a chance to say whether they believed only U.S. citizens should vote in Michigan’s elections. It is still an open question if a large enough group of Michigan voters want to make that a constitutional requirement.
At Thursday’s forum to announce the poll findings, former Democratic Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard said the state’s residents should be proud of the professionalism of local election workers, regardless of the political outcome.
“As with any election, people will have strong feelings about the outcome and the winners,” Blanchard said. “One thing our poll clearly shows is that despite those feelings, Michigan voters are confident in our election system, especially the work of our local and county-level officials and the many hardworking volunteers who provide support at precincts in communities across Michigan.”
Former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler also said that the state’s voters appear overwhelmingly satisfied with existing election processes. Engler went on to say that more education was needed to bring them up to speed on what measures are already in place to ensure secure and safe elections.
“In the past few years, we have seen clerks from both parties actively engaging voters from all backgrounds in their communities – Republicans, Democrats and independents,” Engler said. “At the same time, local media outlets have covered these events and supported civic public education that benefits all of us, and we encourage them to build on these efforts.”
Engler’s comments come at a time when some Republican state lawmakers remain committed to pushing the falsehood that the 2020 and 2022 elections were unfair and are working to relitigate the outcome of those elections despite recent polls like the Glengarrif offering and other assurances through the years.
Former Lt. Gov. John Cherry, a Democrat, said the Glengarrif poll was striking because it was the first time polling has been done where a majority of voters from all backgrounds said they were satisfied with the 2024 results and looked confidently ahead to 2026 – all while acknowledging that existing safeguards were working.
“Where voters say they want to see changes, that list is very narrow,” Cherry said. “We believe that by working together, in a bipartisan way, Michigan policymakers can find reasonable, commonsense and cost-effective ways to address voters’ concerns.” 
Former Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Bishop of Rochester said the poll was evidence that voters of all political leanings wanted to be in the driver’s seat for local, state and national elections, and not politicians in Lansing.
That said, Bishop did say he believed that the proof of citizenship responses in an open-ended portion of the poll shows there is an appetite to move that measure across the finish line.
​​“Voters also have a real desire to ensure only U.S. citizens vote in our elections, and we encourage policymakers to explore solutions that keep our elections secure without putting up barriers that may prevent any eligible voter from exercising their right to vote,” Bishop said. 
Board members of the Democracy Defense Project proposed a solution to that conundrum: expand and support voter access to Michigan Enhanced IDs and driver’s licenses. Both forms of enhanced identification indicate if someone is a U.S. citizen and are compliant with new federal requirements for REAL ID, which allow access to federal buildings, boarding planes and traveling domestically by air and other activities. 
In late May, the Michigan Department of State said it had issued 200,000 REAL IDs in the last few months.
A REAL ID differs from Enhanced ID in that it does not indicate U.S. citizenship, so a pathway to getting the latter could ease citizenship and voting concerns.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Democracy-vote-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

Mike Dunleavy discusses proposed education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vetoed a bill that would have limited high interest rates and fees for payday loans of $25,000 or less, which advocates said would have protected against predatory lending. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 39, passed both the Alaska House and Senate this session, and would have removed payday lenders from a state exemption in lending laws, and placed a cap on interest rates and fees at an annual percentage rate of 36% for customers paying back these loans. Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans often for small amounts that are meant to be repaid on the borrower’s next payday.
In a short memo issued with the veto on Wednesday, Dunleavy cited access to credit and compliance requirements, issues argued by opponents of the measure.
“These changes would reduce short-term credit options – particularly for those without access to traditional banking services – while creating enforcement challenges for the state,” Dunleavy wrote. 
The veto was condemned by a sponsor of the bill.
“I’m very disappointed in the veto. This was a bipartisan bill,” said Rep. Ted Eischeid, D-Anchorage, who introduced the bill in the House, in a phone interview on Friday. He pointed to the fact that payday loans are highly convenient and accessible online, leaving borrowers with high-interest loans that they struggle to repay. 
“It’s easy to get these payday lending loans. But the problem is, people get the loans. They have two weeks to pay them off. They’re charged fees plus interest rates, and oftentimes they can’t pay those,” he said. “They create debt traps.”
Interest rates and fees in Alaska can range from 194% to 521%, according to research by the Alaska Public Interest Research Group. Eischeid noted 18 other states have enacted a cap on interest rates and fees at 36% annual percentage rate, and other banks lending institutions provide emergency loans. “Those states, red and blue, have not had credit crises,” he said.
In 2023, there were 7,085 Alaskans that took out payday loans totaling $17.4 million, according to the state’s Division of Banking and Securities, with loans averaging $440 and each borrower taking out an average of 5.5 loans. 
Eischeid said Alaskans are also targeted by lenders, who can garnish their Permanent Fund dividend checks. “And so when Alaskans can’t pay these debt trap loans, the payday lenders simply go to small claims court and garnish their PFDs,” he said. “It’s a cash cow for payday lenders.”
From 2017 to 2023, payday lenders garnished over $3.7 million from Alaskan’s PFDs, according to court data compiled by Eischeid’s office. 
He said he wished Dunleavy had identified enforcement concerns earlier, as his office worked with the Division of Banking and Securities in drafting the bill to identify any potential issues. “Because we asked, ‘What kind of heartburn is this going to cause the state in terms of enforcement and regulation?’ And they said none,” he said. “I’m confused by that.” 
The Online Lenders Alliance, a national trade organization for financial technology groups that offer online banking services, applauded Dunleavy’s veto. “Governor Dunleavy made the right choice for Alaska consumers by vetoing this flawed legislation,” said the group’s CEO Andrew Duke in an emailed statement. “The ability to access credit is the cornerstone of financial independence and stability.  Unfortunately, SB 39 would have taken away credit options and financial choices for Alaskan consumers and small businesses.” 
The Alaska Public Interest Research Group criticized the veto, saying it’s a failure to protect Alaskans from predatory lending. “This bill is a commonsense, multipartisan effort to end a debt trap that has harmed our communities for over 20 years,” said Claire Estelle Lubke, AKPIRG economic justice lead, in an email. “Instead of siding with Alaskans, the Governor chose to protect an industry that profits from financial insecurity. Payday loans are not an acceptable form of credit for our communities.”
The group is calling for the Legislature to vote to override veto next January and limit what they call a predatory loan industry. 
Eischeid said it’s a possibility. “​​Those discussions have to happen yet. But it’s a good bill, it was a good bill. It works in states where they’ve gotten rid of the special treatment payday lenders get. And I would like to see this effort be successful.”

(Photo courtesy Maryland Municipal League/CGI)Pocomoke City Mayor Todd Nock wants to take the Maryland Municipal League “back to the future.”
Nock, who took over presidency of the league this week, made the comments after being handed the gavel by Frederick Mayor Michael O’Connor, the outgoing president. In his first speech as president, Nock reminisced about his younger self and about the people who nurtured him, before challenging his fellow mayors and city leaders to work to develop the next generation of leaders.
“This year, Maryland Municipal League is going back to the future. Back to our communities. Back to building the next generation of leaders,” Nock said, according to text of his speech provided by the league. “We’re going to be present. We’re going to show up.
Because here’s the reality—we won’t be elected forever. Our job is to prepare, teach, and nurture not just our youth but also support our elders and entire communities,” he said. “It is time to go back home and be who the people elected us to be.”
Nock went on to tell the municipal officials assembled in Ocean City for the league’s annual summer conference that he did not want to be in their communities just “when you polish statues and cut ribbons. I want to be there when you’re hosting community events, when you’re connecting with residents, and when you’re doing the hard work that truly matters.”
Nock will serve a one-year term as president. While he was elevated to the presidency Tuesday, Bladensburg Mayor Takisha James was elected to replace his as president-elect, and will serve once Nock’s term ends.
Dashboard data targets gun violence
The Maryland Department of Health launched new data on gun violence statistics that health officials say will help track trends in gun violence and find solutions to reduce those numbers.
“As someone who has served as a surgeon in emergency departments in Maryland, I have personally seen how Maryland families and communities suffer from the impact of gun violence and its resulting trauma,” Health Secretary Meena Seshamani told reporters Thursday. “Our ultimate goal with these resources is to develop … data-driven solutions that will save the next life, that will protect the next family and that will heal our communities,” she said.

	The dashboard includes a decade of fatal and nonfatal shooting statistics, updated monthly to have “almost a real-time assessment of what gun violence looks like at the state, county and ZIP code level,” Seshamani said. It also includes the number of homicides and suicides related to firearm use.
From Jan. 1 through April, there had been 187 deaths due to firearms, according to the dashboard. About 54% of those deaths were suicides.
In addition to the dashboard, the department released a preliminary state plan to develop a public health approach to lower gun violence. Besides incorporating dashboard data, the plan calls for increased education efforts for effective gun violence prevention strategies and improved coordination between state agencies and local jurisdictions to bring down gun violence.
“It’s always important for us to remember that these statistics — they’re not just numbers,” Seshamani said, “They are real people. They are real victims of a public health crisis.”
You can’t be in the minority if you’re the only one…
Months after frustration of being in the minority drove Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) to say he would not run for reelection, the freshman Republican has modified that statement a little.
He will not seek election to a seat in the House of Delegates. He will seek election to an office on the second floor of the State House — the governor’s office.
Bouchat has not yet formally filed for the office, but confirmed his intention to run for governor, first reported by last week by the Baltimore Sun. While he has not filed the paperwork, Bouchat said he intends to start running ads thiis weekend on Fox45 in Baltimore, not actually pitching his candidacy but urging people to visit  Maryland’s many historic sites. It’s a version of the short video on his delegate site, quickly rebranded to a “Bouchat for Governor” page.

Bouchat said he decided to walk away from the House after one term because of the “super minority status” of Republicans in Maryland, who hold just 28% of seats in both the House and Senate,.
“It’s pretty much hopeless to be a Republican in the Maryland General Assembly,” Bouchat said. “Maryland has been under a legislative dictatorship by the Democratic Party for 105 years.”
He blames that on gerrymandering of legislative districts. Which got him to thinking about the goveror’s race.
“On a governor level, it’s not gerrymandered — it’s statewide,” Bouchat said.
His biggest goal, if elected, is to create a solution to gerrymandering
“What I’m offering is historical,” Bouchat said. “This is going to be one of the greatest political science accomplishments in the history of the world.”
If he files, Bouchat would not be the first Republican to throw his hat in the ring for the governorship: John Myrick and Brenda Thiam are already filed for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Political observers are waiting to see if two-term GOP Gov. Larry Hogan will run for his old seat. And the Republican nominee will likely have to take on Gov. Wes Moore (D), a fundraising juggernaut in a deeply blue state.
While he has not officially filed, Bouchat has until February to sign up.
“I’m in no great hurry,” Bouchat said. “It’s a bit of a strategy to watch it all unfold.
Burd steps up at state retirement system
Robert “Bob” Burd, the deputy chief investment officer for the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, will step up next week to serve as acting CIO, the system’s board of trustees announced.
Burd will take over as interim chief on July 1, with the retrirement of current Chief Investment Officer Andrew Palmer, who has served in that role since 2015. The interim appointment of Burd was announced at the trustees June 17 meeting.
Burd has served as deputy chief investment officer since 2011, helping shape “asset allocation strategy, managing investment risk and overseeing manager selection across the $70 billion portfolio,” according to a news release from the system.
“Bob brings a deep understanding of our portfolio and a steady, principled approach to leadership,” said Executive Director Martin Noven. “He has earned the trust of the Board and I’m confident in his ability to lead the division with focus and integrity during this transitional period.”
Burd served as acting CIO once before, and system officials said his appointment now ensures uninterrupted leadership.
“Bob has worked side-by-side with our team to deliver long-term value for our members,” said State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis, Chair of the SRPS Board of Trustees. “We are fully confident in his ability to guide Maryland’s investment program during this interim period.”
The board said that under Palmer’s tenure, the system “achieved consistent outperformance, expanded internal asset management capabilities, and implemented strategic reforms across public and private markets. Burd has been instrumental in advancing these efforts and will provide continuity and stability during the leadership transition.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54613600036_900624f396_o-1024x981.jpg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

(Photo by Travis Bell/SIDELINE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)In conjunction with other southern states, Florida is developing a new university accrediting commission in response to existing agencies the governor says require schools to “bend the knee” to get accredited.
During a Thursday news conference at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced, alongside State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues and university leaders from Texas and South Carolina, that the states are developing a Commission for Public Higher Education.
DeSantis has focused heavily on “woke” ideologies by pushing legislation to ban state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and remaking state higher education institutions to be more conservative.
In the way of his higher education initiatives, he has said, are accrediting agencies that may require a commitment to those values or other expectations for a university to be recognized.
In order to “shape institutions in a positive way,” DeSantis said, “You gotta go two or three levels down sometimes. And we’ve identified this accreditation cartel as an issue for a long time.”
Florida is establishing the commission with the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, which DeSantis said will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
The layers, for example, can be shown by a 2023 law, SB 266, which outlawed state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but allowed for DEI initiatives to continue if required to maintain accreditation.
DeSantis, who used to own an LSAT prep company, said during the “woke era” “institutions really became corrupted by ideology, and they were putting ideology ahead of the pursuit of truth during COVID.”



Why is USC involved?
Thad Westbrook, board president for the University of South Carolina, joined Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as well as leaders of state schools in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, at this week’s news conference announcing the initiative to form a new accreditation agency.
Referring to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which accredits schools across the Southeast, DeSantis blasted what he called the “woke accreditation cartel,” which has been “hijacked by radical ideology.”
But Westbrook sidestepped such rhetoric in explaining what drew USC to this new partnership. 
Rather than criticize the accrediting agency for anything specific, he described accreditation and re-accreditation, which colleges must go through every five years, as “a very burdensome process.”
He told the SC Daily Gazette that USC could benefit from an accreditation agency tailored to large state college systems, “more peer-to-peer instead of a one-size-fits all” organization that covers the entire region. By joining this partnership, South Carolina’s largest university will have a seat on the governing board as it creates its standards for accreditation.
Westbrook said he wants to see standards focused on student outcomes. In particular, he wants to see increases in the number of students who graduate college within four years or less, progressing through as quickly as possible and entering the workforce.
He said he thinks some accreditation agencies stray from what’s required under the federal Higher Education Act. He said the new agency will still have rigorous standards but won’t go beyond what the law demands.
Westbrook said the costs of applying to become an accrediting agency will be borne by the state of Florida. If the accrediting agency gets federal approval, USC will only pay a membership fee if its governing board votes to leave SACS and apply for accreditation through the new organization.
For USC faculty, the impact of the arrangement is less clear. 
Faculty Senate President Wayne Outten, who teaches biochemistry, said professors and researchers are typically less concerned about which accrediting agency a college uses. When deciding whether to apply for a job, they usually weigh a college’s reputation, salaries and resources for research.
But with so few details available on the new agency, possible effects are unknown at this time.

 Timeline

DeSantis did not lay out a timeline for when the commission would be up and running, acknowledging that it has to meet federal requirements before the U.S. Department of Education can approve it.
“We’re establishing it. You kind of got to go and actually do it for, you know, some period of time,” DeSantis said, adding, “I think U.S. DOE wants to be quick on this.”
DeSantis said he nudged Rodrigues shortly after Trump won the presidency.
“We didn’t really have the prospects of launching anything like this successfully during the Biden years, but it’s a new day, and I think this is going to make a big, big difference,” DeSantis said, adding that if it gets established during the Trump presidency, “then it’s almost impossible for a future federal administration to try to upend the apple cart.”
As recently as 2020, the year after DeSantis took office, the State University System of Florida created a workgroup that, in its final report, concluded that the universities’ “Board of Governors is making a clear and steadfast commitment to prioritize and support diversity, racial and gender equity, and inclusion.”
In 2022, Florida lawmakers approved and DeSantis signed SB 7044 to provoke institutions to seek accreditation from accreditors approved by the State Board of Education or Board of Governors.
 Expecting favorability

“I think almost all the states in our region are going to be favorable to this,” DeSantis said.
“All those states have done good stuff in higher ed anyways but, you know, it’s been more difficult when you have this accreditation cartel nipping at you all the time,” he said. “You know, now I think it’s going to be really, really smooth sailing.”
Florida’s and other southern state institutions are members of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. DeSantis and Rodrigues made jabs at SACSCOC, saying Florida institutions have problems with the accrediting organization and that its member schools’ performance has not been impressive.
“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens. These reforms will benefit our faculty, our students, and the hardworking taxpayers who fund our public systems,” Rodrigues said.
In an emailed statement to the Phoenix, SACSCOC said, “We welcome any new accreditor as they go through a rigorous approval process. Accreditation is central to quality education; thus accreditors are held to high standards and must themselves be reviewed.”
“As for SACSCOC, we know we currently accredit institutions that serve the largest number of students in the country (approximately 5M),” the organization said. “As such, we will work with our partnering institutions to ensure and strengthen a high standard of accreditation that reflects the needs of students, our institutions, and the workforce.”
DeSantis complained that Florida law schools “should not be captive to having to bend the knee to get accreditation from” the American Bar Association, which he said “mandates explicit DEI compliance as a condition of accreditation” and “has now become a far left activist group.” The association has suspended its DEI standard until at least 2026.
The commission “will create a first-of-its-kind accreditation model for public higher education institutions that will offer high-quality, efficient services prioritizing academic excellence, student outcomes, and achievement,” according to the State University System.
“​​Together, we are leaving behind the legacy systems and failed institutions of the past, while charting a new course in higher education, that puts student success at the forefront of everything that we do,” said Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner, who was recently named to that position following outcry from students who feared he would politicize the position.
 Union backlash

The Florida Education Association and United Faculty of Florida released a joint statement following DeSantis’ announcement, saying they “strongly oppose” the move as “directly threatens the independence, integrity, and academic credibility of the state’s higher education system.”
“Accreditation matters because it’s the backbone of academic freedom, shared governance, and public trust in the quality of our institutions,” UFF President Teresa M. Hodge said in a news release.
“This proposed state accreditor appears designed to align more with political priorities rather than academic independence. It seems to be the state’s latest attempt to exert top-down control over what faculty can teach and what students are allowed to learn.”
Andrew Spar, president of the FEA, said he is concerned about how a new accreditor might affect teacher preparation programs.
“Students learn best when they’re free to learn and educators are free to teach — not when curriculum decisions are dictated by politics,” Spar said.



The commission’s announced core principles:

It is appropriate and necessary to introduce competition, aligned with state and institutional needs, into the existing marketplace of university accreditation.
It is in the best interests of all interested parties, including students, to launch an accrediting body comprised of true peer institutions focused on public colleges and universities and their governing university systems.
It is imperative to reduce bureaucracy through a more efficient and focused accreditation process, which will result in lower costs and significant time savings for member institutions, and which will translate into lower tuition prices for students and families.
It is critical to ensure that this new accrediting body is accountable to the states of the member institutions.
It is necessary for the new accrediting body to become and remain recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for the purposes of Title IV participation by its accredited institutions.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Last spring Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo posted a photo of his daughter Vera wearing a baby blue mermaid-style dress with puffy sleeves and a train. She had designed it on her own so, certainly, as a fashion designer who didn’t hesitate to make a gown for a loved one, he made her vision come true. 
On Friday, Vera wore that gown again while singing for hundreds during the celebration of life Ah Loo’s friends and family organized after he was tragically wounded during the “No Kings” rally June 14. Many joined Vera in donning the tributes to the renowned designer’s style, wearing geometrical prints, flowers, formal wraparound skirts known as ie faitaga, sleek hairstyles, and so, so many of Ah Loo’s gowns.  
Laura Ah Loo, his wife, wore a flowy, green dress adorned with a yellow lei. It was one of the best dresses of the night, Telesia Afeaki Tonga, the event’s emcee said, because she was one of his main sources of inspiration. Laura’s voice cracked as she thanked family, friends and fellow protesters for all the love they had received in the last weeks.

“Losing Afa feels like losing the sun, our light, our warmth and our comfort,” Laura Ah Loo said. “It is more devastating than I can ever put into words, because no amount of words can encompass who he was as a person and who he was to me and our babies.”
Ah Loo’s big community gathered at the Salt Palace Convention Center’s grand ballroom, a room as big as the presence he had in the Pacific Islander communities in Utah and beyond.
“Of course it had to be in a grand ballroom, like only he would have. Absolutely extra,” Tonga said.

Ah Loo’s participation on “Project Runway” in 2019 expanded his presence in the fashion industry. However, being the first Samoan to participate in the show, among many other feats, made him a point of reference in Polynesian communities. After moving to Utah, he continued weaving his legacy, mentoring anyone with a creative pursuit and supporting the state’s Pacific Islander community though a nonprofit he co-founded, Creative Pacific.
While his job took him to other cities and countries, his greatest joy wasn’t on a runway, but at home with his family, his wife said. And sometimes, at McDonald’s with a large Coke. 
“I will miss taking sips of his drinks because I never wanted to order my own, his constant eye rolls at my antics and hearing him speak Samoan, his beautiful singing voice,” Laura Ah Loo said. “And, as he called it, his hyena laugh. But to me, it was the best sound in the world.” 
Beloved Utah fashion designer’s friends remember his life and his last moments

After her loss, Laura Ah Loo has been planning to continue her husband’s work and legacy, a task that now seems impossible to equally replicate. But, she still sees parts of him every day, in their kids’ brown eyes, creativity, “healing hugs,” and “larger than life” personalities, all attributes they share with Ah Loo. Also in the remaining fingerprints he left behind and his voice in all the videos saved in their phones. 
Just like Ah Loo did after his fashion shows, Laura Ah Loo walked along a runway, holding Vera’s and her son Isaac’s hands while friends and family gave a standing ovation. 
June 14 remains a painful day for his family. But Laura Ah Loo still finds inspiration in the sign he held that day, which read “The world is watching.”
“They were watching then, and they’re watching, certainly watching now. The world is watching how we carry his light, how we treat each other, how each keep choosing love in the face of unthinkable loss, how we raise our children, how we fight for joy in spite of hard times,” she said. “He will not be forgotten.”
Others also took the stage to perform a musical number or a dance, often included in Polynesian funerals, or to tell stories of Ah Loo’s life as a beloved mentor, friend and brother, distinguished by his sense of humor, sarcasm and kindness.

“I see all your posts about him. I see all your tributes about him, and how I’ve sat down several times to write something about him, but I can’t,” his sister Ofeira Asuao said. “There’s just no words for me to explain the impact that he’s had.”

Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.

Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through COVID, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

Michigan’s top election official is locked in a clamorous legal battle with Republican lawmakers over access to election training materials, a conflict that likely has less to do with policy than politics — and the coming race for governor.
And if the battle continues at its current volume, voter trust in Michigan’s elections could take a beating.
On one side is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who won her 2022 re-election race by nearly 14 percentage points and is now a leading Democratic candidate for governor. Since 2019, she has been a key part of the Democratic power structure in the executive branch and the face of election oversight in a swing state that became a target of heavy scrutiny and conspiracy theories after Donald Trump’s 2020 loss.
On the other side is the Michigan state House, back under Republican control since January, which has subpoenaed her, sued her, and even made moves to impeach her.
Leading the charge there is Rep. Rachelle Smit, a Republican and former township clerk from Martin who took over in January as chair of the House Committee on Election Integrity. For several months, she has been seeking access to the Department of State’s election training portal to check for “flawed guidance.” Benson and her office have been pushing back.
With each day, the confrontation over election manuals looks more and more like a mobilization for next year’s political campaigns, where Republicans hope to retake the governor’s mansion after eight years of being shut out of statewide office. Benson is one of the people who stand in the way.
Smit hasn’t identified specific concerns about the content of the training manuals, but has instead cited what she calls a “concerning track record” of illegal guidance from Benson, based on the fact that Benson’s office has faced many election-related lawsuits, and has lost some of them.
“The Michigan House Committee on Election Integrity has a duty to provide oversight,” Smit told Votebeat. “We seek to review the training materials to ensure MDOS is properly training clerks on the law.”
Benson’s office has not provided access to all the documents upon request, citing concerns over information security. That has prompted an escalating series of steps by the Republicans to challenge Benson for the access, and countermoves by Benson to defend her office’s response.
Their dispute is now before the Michigan Court of Claims, which has set deadlines for filing legal briefs, though an actual resolution could be weeks away. Meanwhile, both sides are using the fight as fodder for fund-raising appeals.
 Conflict heats up after power shift in the House

The conflict has simmered for months, but escalated after Republicans reclaimed the House in November’s election. That’s when Smit requested access to the state’s election training portal, which provides manuals and tools for local officials.
Smit said the Department of State initially couldn’t fulfill her request. She then filed a public-records request and was told it would require 140 hours and nearly $9,000 to fulfill — a cost she called “ridiculous.”
Shortly after, Smit was named the chair of the House election committee, newly renamed the Committee on Election Integrity. She then sent another request for the information, which the Department of State said it would fulfill in part. But the requested documents never came. At Smit’s request, the House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena for the documents.
Republicans say the subpoena was necessary to ensure the balance of power in Michigan government. Smit’s office did not respond to Votebeat questions on what specific concerns prompted the inquiry.
Benson, whose office also handles motor vehicle services, has faced numerous challenges to her guidance and conduct of elections — more election lawsuits than her last four predecessors combined. But her record is better than that of past secretaries from both parties. A review by the Michigan Information & Research Service found that while Benson has lost some election-related lawsuits, she has won significantly more cases than her predecessors.
Several cases have had mixed rulings, like a lawsuit from the Republican National Committee over voter signatures on absentee ballots, where part of Benson’s guidance was struck down while other pieces were allowed to remain in place. Out of 69 total cases since 2019, Benson’s office had five “losses,” according to the MIRS analysis.
Department of State spokesperson Angela Benander said the cost estimate the department gave Smit after the November request followed state Freedom of Information Act requirements, including producing the records and redacting sensitive sections. “We are now well above that,” she said, noting that more than 20 staff members have worked on it over recent weeks.
The Department of State said it made multiple offers to provide the requested materials securely with redactions, but the Oversight Committee rejected them. The subpoena sought information that could jeopardize election security, Benander told Votebeat in April, by risking the chain of custody of ballots and revealing specific locations for trainings for election officials, among other concerns. Election workers across the state have faced threats of violence in recent years.
The department then went public, posting information about the documents it had already shared with lawmakers. Benson reiterated the department’s position that releasing sensitive information could jeopardize election security.
“This is true even if those seeking the information are well-intentioned,” she said in May. “Each time sensitive information is released, its risk of misuse increases.”
Since then, she has issued regular updates, sharing more documents, doubling down on security concerns, and preparing for a legal showdown.
Republicans have also escalated: On May 22, the House voted along party lines to hold Benson and the entire Department of State in contempt. On June 3, Rep. Jim DeSana, a Republican from Carleton, introduced articles of impeachment against her in a House resolution, alleging that she abused her authority, mishandled records, and intimidated local officials in the way she oversaw the state’s elections.
Then, earlier this month, the House Oversight Committee sued Benson and her department, alleging they were refusing to provide the training documents “in their irrational and even conspiratorial objections to the House Subpoenas.”
Benson said in a statement that she welcomed the suit as a chance to resolve the matter in court.
 What will voters make of the Benson vs. GOP fight?

While the battle has been useful for driving fund-raising campaigns — for both Benson and the Republicans — it’s unlikely to swing any votes so far out from an actual election, David Dulio, a political science professor at Oakland University, told Votebeat.
The House GOP effort might be intended to damage Benson’s campaign, he said, “but the people who they would want to persuade aren’t paying attention. They have other stuff to worry about.”
Jeffrey Bernstein, a political science professor at Eastern Michigan University, agreed. Those who are most tuned in to politics probably have already formed their opinions on how Michigan’s elections are run, he said.
“People are going to start paying attention soon enough,” he said, “but there will be other things happening then to occupy their attention.”
Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson, a political science professor at Wayne State University, worries, though, that such a pitched conflict in Lansing could have a lasting effect for people who aren’t so tuned into politics by casting a “vague and hazy” cloud over elections.
Even this far out from an election, she told Votebeat, “when you start casting doubt on integrity, public trust suffers.”
The best case scenario, Sarbaugh-Thompson said, is a quick ruling from the courts to quiet the entire issue. But she doesn’t expect quiet anytime soon.

Dorie Ladner was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. She and her sister, Joyce, became involved early with the civil rights movement, working with Medgar Evers, Vernon Dahmer, Clyde Kennard and others. 
She and her sister were kicked out of Jackson State University for their support of the Tougaloo Nine, who integrated the all-white library in downtown Jackson. They became even more active at Tougaloo College. They worked with the Freedom Riders, joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped with the 1963 March on Washington. 
Dorie escorted Fannie Lou Hamer to register to vote. Joyce pursued graduate school, earning a doctorate in sociology, becoming the first female president of Howard University. Dorie continued her civil rights work, participating in every major civil rights march through 1968. In Washington, D.C., she earned her master’s in social work, counseling emergency room patients, visiting schools and working with the Rape Crisis Center. 
The sisters were honored at the Kennedy Center, and Dorie received the Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute on Citizenship and Democracy Humanitarian Award. A decade before her death in 2024, she received an honorary doctorate from Tougaloo.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland households will have to wait just a little bit longer for a promised rebate on their energy bills amid the summer heat.
While legislative leaders had said they expected the first payments in July, the Maryland Public Service Commission said Friday that the first round of rebates to all residential energy customers is expected in August or September. A second round is anticipated in either January or February.
Total payments are expected to average about $80 per household for the year.
PSC Chair Fred Hoover said the commission spoke with utilities — which will actually dole out the rebates to customers — as well as ratepayer advocates and its own staff, to come up with the best plan for handing out the money.
The commission “has selected a plan that will allow for the most equitable, efficient and timely distribution of refunds to provide relief to customers, particularly those most affected by bill increases this past winter,” Hoover wrote.
The refund payments will show up as credits on ratepayers’ bills and will be based on a customer’s usage over a year, with those who use more energy getting a larger rebate. But the PSC also directed utilities to disburse 25% of the money evenly across all ratepayers, to ensure all customers get a baseline amount.
The PSC also advised utilities to advertise ways for customers to donate their rebate to others if they choose, including to the Fuel Fund of Maryland or SMECO’s Members Helping Members program. For the winter rebate, utilities were told to explore ways that customers could refuse the rebate and send it instead to other customers who receive bill assistance from the state.

The rebates were authorized by legislators as part of the Next Generation Energy Act, a wide-ranging bill that also included a regulatory fast-track for new power plants and other energy infrastructure in the state.
Lawmakers tapped $200 million to pay the rebates from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which utilities if they do not purchase a specified amount of renewable energy for their portfolios. The fund has ballooned in recent years.
During a news conference Wednesday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) referenced this week’s high temperatures, which flirted with 100, and their impact on already soaring bills.
“I have an HVAC repair person coming tomorrow,” Ferguson said. “So we are personally dealing with the challenges of what I know a number of Maryland families are, which is unbelievably hot weather, and then the resultant impact on people’s bills, which feels like a double hit. I am as frustrated as anyone.”
High utility bills were a major topic of conversation for the 2025 legislature, following high costs during a cold winter, thanks in large part to higher natural gas distribution rates. But now, electricity rates are poised to increase as well for the delivery year that began in June.
The increases will hit different customers at different times: June 1 for SMECO customers, August for Pepco and Delmarva Power customers, and October for Potomac Edison. BGE, which will have the highest increases, was ordered by the PSC to spread them over three months this fall and again next spring, in order to dull the impact in the high-use summer and winter periods.
Moore signed the Next Generation bill and one other energy bill, but vetoed the Energy Resource Planning Act, which would have set up an in-house energy planning office for state government. He recently critiqued the Next Generation law, saying it did not go far enough to attract power generators to build in Maryland.
“We introduced legislation this year that would have allowed more nuclear into the state, that would have allowed nuclear to be seen as a clean energy source, which it is,” Moore said. “I’m proud of the work we did in partnership with the legislature, but I want to be crystal clear: It did not go far enough.”
Ferguson pushed back this week.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I don’t know what the governor was talking about when he said that. I genuinely have no idea what he was referencing,” Ferguson said during his news conference. “I think that we did incredibly important work to make it easier for all sorts of cleaner energy, from natural gas to wind to solar to geothermal to batteries.”
He said Moore’s nuclear bill would have increased costs for ratepayers, which “was not something that we were going to tolerate. So, what we did was incorporate components of the governor’s bill into the Next Generation Act.”
The bill directs state agencies to pursue nuclear cost-sharing agreements with neighboring states and agreements with federal agencies about nuclear siting, including for small modular reactors.
The fiscal note for Moore’s bill said that “in the short term, the bill appears likely to increase electricity rates,” because it increased the amount utilities would have to pay the state to comply with a solar energy goal. It also established a nuclear energy procurement mechanism that would be funded by ratepayers.
But legislative analysts said the governor’s bill had “the potential to provide other benefits to the broader energy market and eventually reduce associated electricity rates paid by customers in the State.”
Ferguson was also quick to note that increasing power generation in the state isn’t a cure-all. Maryland is part of a 13-state region whose electrical grid is controlled by PJM Interconnection, which has been criticized for policies that make it difficult for new power sources — particularly renewable — to come online at a time of surging demand.
“Generation is a problem within the PJM territory, for all 13 states, and even in states that are net exporters, that generally are sending their energy to other states,” Ferguson said. “This, sadly, is not a problem that we can fix in a day, a week or a month.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/transmission-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 08:04:05.007854

Growing demands, arrivals at all hours and a rare disease are just some of the challenges Vermont’s prisons have faced while working with federal immigration authorities. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Internal communications reveal Vermont prisons’ frustrations working with ICE.","Greg Hale didn’t understand why border patrol officers from Maine were showing up at the prison he oversees in St. Albans town. He was used to federal immigration authorities bringing detainees in from Vermont’s northern border. But this signaled a shift. 
The superintendent of Northwest State Correctional Facility, Hale had previously informed his contacts at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that Vermont didn’t want to become the feds’ hub in the Northeast.
“Apparently they are disregarding that,” he noted in a memo to his higher-ups at the Vermont Department of Corrections in early March.  
The emails reveal mounting frustration within Vermont’s corrections system as ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have increasingly relied on the state’s prisons to warehouse detained immigrants. New demands, arrivals at all hours and a rare disease are just some of the challenges Vermont’s prisons have faced while working with federal immigration authorities.

Internal communications since the start of President Donald Trump’s second administration, obtained through a public records request, offer a window into how the Vermont Department of Corrections has cooperated with — and pushed back against — federal immigration police as the number of detententions increased. Leaders have navigated the growing strain on the state’s prison system while also encountering the unique health and language difficulties posed by housing immigrant detainees.
Nationwide, ICE is detaining about 59,000 people, a possible record. Deportations have also ramped up, according to the New York Times, while border apprehensions have fallen. 
Regionally, in addition to Vermont’s prisons, the federal government uses facilities in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts to hold immigrants, many of whom have not been charged with crimes. 
Vermont’s memorandum of understanding with U.S. immigration authorities gives them access to the state’s six prisons in exchange for $180 per-detained person, per-day. That deal expires in August.
This year, the Legislature passed a law removing a provision in state statute that allowed collaboration between local and state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities during declared states of emergency. 
In Vermont, the St. Albans prison serves as ICE’s primary jail for male detainees, and Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington holds female immigration detainees. The average number of immigrants detained for federal officials in Vermont’s prisons fluctuates, hovering in the teens to the 20s on any given day.

Federal officials have also shuffled detainees from other states into and out of Vermont, and used commercial flights out of the Burlington airport to facilitate deportations. 
Those jailed in Vermont’s prisons include people with established lives in the state, like farmworkers. Vermont’s prisons have also held people from other New England states, like a Russian scientist working at Harvard University.
VTDigger’s reporting previously revealed the challenges facing jailed immigrants. Several people in prison reported that ICE detainees were struggling to access phone calls, lawyers and medical attention, often due to a lack of translation services. The department of corrections has invested increased resources to address language access concerns, documents show. 
Following the high-profile arrests of Columbia University student and Palestinian rights activist Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University grad student Rümeysa Öztürk, Vermont’s work with ICE drew increased scrutiny. 
The Vermont Department of Corrections declined interview requests for this story, instead answering questions over email. Asked about workers’ complaints with the feds, Haley Sommer, a department spokesperson, wrote “DOC is committed to maintaining a collaborative working relationship with our federal partners.”
‘Not a fan of ICE’
As federal authorities increased their use of Vermont’s prisons, leadership at the St. Albans prison grew frustrated, records indicate. 
ICE agents’ demands stacked up. They requested detainees’ medical information, which they said was “required for the flights,” in addition to bagged meals and clothing. Sometimes, they arrived in the middle of the night. 
In late February, St. Albans’ assistant superintendent informed his higher-up that during a recent interaction with ICE, agents were “very very lax in their security procedures around their keys and they were rude when confronted about it.”
“Let’s get a report and then we can yell at them,” Hale, the superintendent, responded.  
The next month, ICE transferred 19 people out of the prison at 4 a.m, requesting medical summaries, two meals, and closed-toed shoes for each. The day after, federal agents brought in 16 new detainees, according to communications records. 
“Mostly I am concerned about the traffic, my booking is not built for 31 ICE movements in 24 hours, this is on top of normal movements,” Hale wrote to his corrections colleagues. “Booking is swamped and we are going to miss something critical.”
He made his exasperation clear to department leadership.
“I continue to push back on them, but they are technically operating within the agreement I think, it is just overwhelming us,” he wrote of ICE. “This break-neck pace with them is going to be the cause of bigger issues.”
Hale attached security camera photos of the crowded areas, though the department declined to provide them in the records request, citing security concerns. 
“What a mess and by all accounts not a safe situation for our staff to be in,” Al Cormier, DOC’s chief of operations, responded to Hale.  
The superintendent was taken by surprise when the news arrived in March that border patrol agents from Maine were bringing detainees to St. Albans. One of his colleagues questioned ICE on the decision, writing, “It was my understanding that we don’t accept individuals that cross the border from other states … Is this a new practice that we have started?”
Elsewhere, Hale noted ICE provides little information to state staff — and he was skeptical of the information the feds do provide. 
“It’s unusual for them to share much of anything honestly and what is shared I don’t trust,” he wrote.

Around the same time Hale was raising concern about the feds’ increased presence, his counterpart at the South Burlington prison, Superintendent Theresa Messier, also noted an uptick. In an email to the department’s health equity program director, she asked for additional support for the women’s prison’s work with detained immigrants.
“I think it would be a good idea for you to come to talk with staff regarding ICE detainees. There has been an increase with them recently and there have been issues,” Messier wrote.
But though corrections staff expressed annoyance at ICE’s strain on the system, the working relationship appeared solid from the feds’ perspective.
After an inspection of the women’s prison this spring, ICE’s detention oversight branch reported they were “highly impressed with all of the operations” and identified no deficiencies.  
In April, Nick Deml, the corrections department’s commissioner, convened a meeting with the South Burlington and St. Albans superintendents to discuss their experience working with the feds. 
In an email to many of the department’s central office staff on the day of the scheduled meeting, Hale offered his thoughts on the state’s continued cooperation with immigration authorities. While he described himself as “not a fan of ICE,” he didn’t think ending the state’s contract would impact the feds’ operations, and he feared financial retaliation from the Trump administration.
“That said, I do think working toward restructuring the contract to better reflect the amount of work, time, and other resources it takes to house their detainees not to mention meeting our own operational (requirements), would be worthwhile if that is a supported direction at some point,” he wrote to department leadership. 
Inroads for a deadly disease
With detainees arriving at Vermont’s prisons after leaving countries around the world, staff communication shows the emergence of a unique health challenge: tuberculosis. 
In late April, an infection control coordinator with the department’s health services contractor, Wellpath, outlined concern about detained immigrants carrying and spreading the dangerous disease — a bacterial illness most often impacting the lungs that is rare in the United States. While treatable, tuberculosis kills more than a million people per year worldwide. 
Later, Travis Denton, DOC’s facilities division director, summarized the issue as described by Wellpath. Procedures at the time allowed ICE detainees to enter the general population before the results of their tuberculosis tests came back, he wrote. 
“Recent incidents have involved patients who were later confirmed TB-positive after already entering GP, posing serious exposure risks,” Denton told colleagues in a memo. 
Last year, there were more than 10,000 tuberculosis cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because immigration detainees may have arrived in the U.S. from countries where tuberculosis is more prevalent, some of those cases are found in prisons. 
Last fall in Louisiana, an ICE detainee tested positive for a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis, but it’s unclear how prevalent the disease is across all facilities. According to a 2004 memo written by an ICE official, there were between 100-150 tuberculosis cases a year in detainees at that time. Academic studies have shown immigrants detained in the U.S. are far more likely to have the disease than the country’s population as a whole.
Language barriers and unreliable self reporting made it challenging to identify people’s tuberculosis history, Denton wrote, and the disease’s symptoms overlap with drug detox and Covid-19 — health concerns staff are more accustomed to.

The medical contractor proposed a system to account for the concerns. Detainees would receive a tuberculosis test during intake and spend the first two to three days in restrictive housing or another separated space until the test results arrived. Anyone who tested positive would receive a chest X-ray and potentially be moved to the hospital. 
“I want to just flag that the distance between this proposal, and successful implementation, is not quick or short,” Denton wrote in the memo.
He described the proposal as a big undertaking reminiscent of procedural changes during the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is further complicated by the focus on ICE detainees, which is a chaotic process that we have very little control over, and must be handled strategically due to the high-profile nature of topic,” he wrote. 
Later, as Denton informed the department’s leadership of the proposal, his skepticism grew. “While the intent behind Wellpath’s proposed protocol is understandable, it doesn’t appear to fully account for the significant operational impact it would create,” he wrote, questioning whether there was any input from the prison’s security staff.
Hale, the St. Albans prison leader, echoed Denton’s concerns, saying Northwest lacked the cell space for such a procedure: “I get the concern but I don’t see how this will work.”
Asked this week whether the department had ultimately decided to change procedures, Sommer, the spokesperson, wrote that Wellpath had “enhanced patient monitoring practices.”
“Since the implementation of the new policy, there have not been any active confirmed TB cases,” she told VTDigger.
While ICE will likely continue to work with Vermont’s prisons, what that work looks like could change. 
Gov. Phil Scott holds sole authority in the state to partner with federal immigration authorities. Asked in June about whether the state would renew or alter the existing agreement, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, signaled the deal would continue in some form. 
“The Governor has been clear that he believes there should be a state contract with ICE because canceling or allowing the contract to expire won’t stop detainments, it will simply mean detainees will be sent someplace else,” she wrote. “We’re not going to get out ahead of contract negotiations, but we are reviewing the (contract) and considering changes.” 
Vermont’s current agreement with federal authorities expires on Aug. 21.

Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.

Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
5 million adults
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through Covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Arkansas, Georgia
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
More than 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it. 


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that. 


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Two wins and two sellouts marked this year’s women’s exhibition matches as a permanent team is in the works.

Busy Anderson is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — A year’s worth of anticipation hailed down on Vermont Green’s Sophie Reale as she blew past two defenders and harvested the first goal of the women’s exhibition matches last week. 
Five thousand fans brought Virtue Field to capacity and spilled onto the nearby hillside for the games against semipro teams Flower City Union and A.S. Blainville. World Cup winner Sam Mewis returned as head coach this year, but young fans were no farther from the field’s railings as she took the pitch. 
“Playing for the national team, playing in the NWSL, the fans have this hungriness for more: for more access, for more autographs, for pictures,” said Mewis, who moved to Colchester after retiring from the U.S. team. “It is honestly really familiar from playing at the level that I played at before.”
A hum about Vermont Green’s expansion into the women’s game underscored the two sellouts and two wins: 4–0 over Flower City, 2–1 over Blainville. This year, nurturing a lush landscape for soccer in Vermont is top of mind.

Players convened June 9 for the first of three practices before their Flower City matchup, many learning each other’s names for the first time. In their two games, Green would entertain and improve, Mewis said that day.   
“Every time you get the ball is an opportunity to express yourself,” coach Brad Cole added during drills. 
Last season, Vermont Green announced a permanent women’s squad is a matter of when, not if. Exhibition games will continue until a full season is secured, with Mewis and University of Vermont women’s soccer head coach Kristi Huizenga guiding the launch.

Olivia Borgen, Sophia Lowenberg and Violet Rademacher claimed a goal each for the Green in Wednesday’s second half, conceding none. The 4–0 outcome was much more comfortable than the Green’s 5–4, penalty kick win over FC Laval in 2024. The difference was in the roster, and particularly the personnel on the sidelines, said goalkeeping coach Erin Murphy. 
“It’s not just, we took the male coaches and had them go female,” she said. “I think Sam has really embraced her role a lot this year.” 
Joining Mewis was former Portland Thorns player Mo Fitzgerald, with Murphy stepping up as a coach after her own career with UVM and the Green. 
“You also have to develop coaches, more women coaches, more referees.  You need more administrators. You have to have talent in the front office,” sports journalist Meg Linehan said on “The Women’s Game,” a podcast run by Mewis.
At the top of both matches, the Green and their opponents walked out with girls from Nordic SC, Monarchs SC and the Mad River Valley Soccer Association. All-female referees supervised the field and ball girls fueled the fast pace. During Saturday’s contest, Democratic U.S. Rep. Becca Balint announced that the Vermont Community Foundation would send $10,000 to the Burlington School District to buy cleats and other gear.
The National Women’s Soccer League has seen a 163% increase in attendance since its 2013 start and will add the nearby Boston Legacy to its ranks in 2026. The Massachusetts club’s swan logo was scattered in the Virtue Field stands at the Green’s exhibition matches less than a week after the crest was unveiled.

Joining the surge is the professional women’s United Soccer League Super League, home to eight clubs founded in August 2024. Tampa Bay won the inaugural championship in front of a sold out crowd Saturday night, and seven new teams are set to debut next season. 
“I’ve played soccer in the mid-’70s in Venezuela where it was a very hot sport, and just to see the degree of athleticism that these women have, how far the sport has come in terms of how soccer is played with women, is amazing,” said fan Alicia Daniel from Burlington.
The Green has a solid foundation on which to rest ambitions for a second team. Vermont led the nation in youth sports participation in the most recent measure by the federally funded and directed National Survey of Children’s Health: 69% of kids ages 6-17 played on a sports team or took lessons in 2022, well above the national average of 54%. 
Vermont families have 46 competitive clubs and 51 recreational programs to choose from under the Vermont Soccer Association, the state’s arm of U.S. Youth Soccer. When Andrew Minnis joined the state org as executive director last December, he looked to collaborate with the Green’s founders right away. 
“A big push of mine since I came in has been really trying to bridge the gap of southern Vermont,” Minnis said. 
Clubs under the association are more abundant in and around Chittenden County, with less access to youth soccer south of Montpelier, he said. 
The association’s partnership with U.S. Youth Soccer’s Europe branch, announced last month, holds promise for an exchange of knowledge overseas that could help coaches add teams to Vermont’s inventory, Minnis said.  
At the moment, when teens surpass the challenge of local clubs, their paths upward become more sparse. Players can be selected for Vermont’s Olympic Development Program with the chance to represent their state, region or country but have few options outside those rosters.

In high school, the Green’s Liv White commuted three hours from her hometown of Pittsford to play with New England Mutiny, a Massachusetts club, she said on “The Women’s Game.” When coaching local clubs, White’s teammate Lauren DeGroot sees that routes to elite teams lead kids out of Vermont. 
“These girls are super talented, and we’re able to see that from such a young age, and it’s unfortunate that you see those girls and you feel like you’re doing them a disservice cause there aren’t those opportunities,” she said. “You think, ‘Can we send them down to Massachusetts, Jersey, so they can get that? Cause they aren’t getting it here.’” 
Female footballers of the Green’s caliber are still looking elsewhere for off-season training.
“I have to drive an hour and 15 minutes to Quebec to play soccer over the summer,” said Sydney Remington, a UVM player, of her training without the Green. 
Green forward Erin Flurey closed shop that night, poking in a loose ball to slash Blainville’s 1–0 lead and chipping the keeper in a bold signoff for a 2–1 win. The women’s exhibition team concluded year two undefeated. 
Best friends Marie Coyne and Veda Pfeifer walked out to centerfield hand in hand with Green and Blainville players before kick off. The girls are 10 years old and don’t doubt they can compete on Virtue someday. They just need some support. 
“Like cheering for you and saying, ‘You got this,’” said Pfeifer. 
Convinced the Green is here to stay, fans imagine the club playing at home fields all around Vermont, not just at Virtue, and even a new stadium open to local teams when Green isn’t in town. But a simpler goal played on repeat all week:

A Utah State University study finds Airbnb-style rentals are reshaping life for Bear Lake residents.

Bear Lake—Residents of a tourist destination straddling the Utah-Idaho state line say the communities here have long been close-knit, but new research shows that sense of neighborly connection may be disappearing.
Utah State University’s Community and Natural Resources Institute recently released results from a survey that show growing concerns among Bear Lake residents over the rising number of short-term rentals, such as Airbnb properties, in the area.
Alex Theophilus, a sociology PhD student and lead author of the report, said these properties may be contributing to the weakening of community ties. He spent months in 2024 interviewing residents of Garden City and Laketown in Utah, and Montpelier, Bennington, Paris, Fish Haven and Saint Charles in Idaho, about their experiences. The lake is about a 45-minute drive away for Wyomingites who live in Cokeville and Kemmerer.
“There’s not that same connection built season over season that people felt existed in the Bear Lake area,” Theophilus said. “They think short-term rentals are posing a threat to that.”
The rise of platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo throughout the 2010s, combined with a surge in tourism during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, spurred rapid growth in short-term rentals around Bear Lake, Theophilus said. This was made worse by the limited availability of hotels.

Research shifted focus
In the spring and summer of 2024, Theophilus and his research team conducted interviews with both full-time and seasonal residents of Bear Lake to understand how changes in the environment and community were affecting quality of life. While short-term rentals were not the original focus, the properties came up in nearly every conversation, Theophilus said.
One issue brought up by residents, he said, is housing affordability and availability. Many vacation rental owners don’t live nearby and treat these homes as investments to rent out during peak tourist season and earn some extra cash. This often means homes that could be used by year-round or seasonal residents are instead being taken off the market or built specifically for visitors.
Some residents surveyed worry that neighborhoods with many of these properties lose the stability and relationships that come from long-term neighbors, Theophilus said.
“People talked about how if too many of the houses in their neighborhoods are short-term rentals, then their kids don’t have neighborhood kids to play with,” he said, “because there’s this revolving door of people coming in and out of the community for that short-term rental, rather than building relationships with their neighbors in the longer term.”
There are also concerns about trash, parking disputes and noise complaints tied to disrespectful renters, he added.
More than 1,000 Airbnb listings are spread across Rich County, Utah, and Bear Lake County, Idaho — areas with fewer than 10,000 permanent residents combined, Theophilus said. And Airbnb is just one of several short-term rental services in the area.
“There were lots of folks we talked to who were concerned that the community is developing in a way that caters to wealthier tourists or wealthier newcomers,” Theophilus said, “and that the values and considerations of longtime community members aren’t necessarily being taken into account as frequently as some folks wish they would.”

Existing regulations
Mitch Poulsen, executive director of the Bear Lake Regional Commission, said regulations for short-term rentals also vary sharply between the Utah and Idaho sides of the lake. While its residents still report concerns, Rich County, Utah, has had a permitting process for these properties for about seven years, with some basic rules, he said.
But Bear Lake County, Idaho, has almost no regulations, leading to overcrowded properties, camping in yards and overloaded septic systems, Poulsen said. In some cases, he added, old farmhouses with just one or two bedrooms are packed well beyond their capacity with large groups.
“I would like to see them regulated,” Poulsen said. “The attitude right now is let the market dictate, and I just don’t know that’s a good idea. When you’ve got houses that have 60 and 80 people in them, it’s not really a residence anymore.”
He feels Utah’s requirements, which call for a license and limits on guests and parking, are not particularly burdensome.
“It’s just unfortunate,” he said, “that Idaho can’t see that.”
Regulation on the Idaho side would have to come from the state Legislature. Some homeowner associations here have taken matters into their own hands. Kevin McLeod, president of the Bear Lake West HOA, said his community bans short-term rentals to protect amenities like pools and water usage.
“When these large groups rent these homes, it impacts your amenities,” McLeod said. “It impacts everything.”
Bear Lake West’s ban on short-term rentals was written into its governing documents before the Idaho Legislature passed a law limiting new HOA restrictions on them. That change prevents newly formed HOAs from outright banning short-term rentals — but communities like Bear Lake West that had preexisting restrictions are allowed to maintain them.
Since then, McLeod said the HOA has continued to survey its members on whether short-term rentals should be allowed.
“Far and away the majority has been ‘no,’” he said, “so we’ve not moved that direction.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

She slept by his hospital bedside for weeks when he was extremely sick from untreated HIV.(Amy Maxmen/KFF Health News)GREENVILLE, Miss. — Cedric Sturdevant woke up with “a bit of depression” but made it to church, as he does every Sunday. In a few days, he would drive from Mississippi to Washington, D.C., to join HIV advocates at an April rally against the Trump administration’s actions.
It had clawed back more than $11 billion in federal public health grants to states and abruptly terminated millions of dollars in funds for HIV work in the United States. Testing and outreach for HIV faltered in the South, a region that accounts for more than half of all HIV diagnoses.
Dangerous changes loomed: To compensate for tax cuts for the wealthy, Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill and budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 threaten to curtail Medicaid, which provides health coverage for people with low incomes and disabilities. About 40% of adults with HIV rely on it for their lifesaving treatments.
Further, the budget proposes to eliminate all HIV prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This alone could lead to an additional 14,600 HIV-related deaths within the next five years, according to one analysis.
Trump’s budget proposal also would cancel a major grant that provides housing assistance for people with HIV. And it would end a strategic initiative to expand HIV services in minority communities, and another to support the mental health of people of color with HIV or at risk of infection.
“President Trump is committed to eliminating radical gender and racial ideologies that poison the minds of Americans,” a White House addendum to the budget says. Letters terminating HIV grants used similar language, targeting “diversity,” “equity,” and “gender minorities,” words that focus resources where they are needed most. Black and Latino people account for about 70% of new HIV infections in the U.S.
The cuts affect Sturdevant personally. He is a gay, Black man living with HIV and the co-founder of a grassroots group that combats health disparities in the Mississippi Delta, one of the poorest regions of the country.
 
That morning at church, a close friend, pastor Jerry Shelton of Anointed Oasis of Love Ministry, asked Sturdevant to help him deliver a sermon about resisting the urge to give up when life is hard. “The storm may come, but I shall not be moved!” Shelton preached, directing the congregation to approach adversity with confidence in themselves and in God. “Walk boldly!” he shouted.
After the service, Sturdevant resolved to bring the same energy to Washington. He’d tell his colleagues that they are survivors, he said. He’d tell them, “Let’s get together and make a plan.”
In the past few months, HIV advocates have begun to organize and strategize ways to limit the damage as federal funds are slashed and inflammatory rhetoric rises.
“It is a very scary time to be Black, queer, and living with HIV,” said Marnina Miller, co-executive director of the Positive Women’s Network, a nationwide group for women living with HIV. “But I am grateful that I am part of a community that will not bow down.”
“People are not giving up,” said June Gipson, the CEO of a health care nonprofit, My Brother’s Keeper, in Mississippi. Then she referenced the 1980s cartoon where heroes combine forces to create a super robot to defend the universe:
“We’ve got to form Voltron.”

The weight of stigma
Sturdevant often reminds his colleagues of all the HIV movement has overcome. In the 1980s, the government refused to acknowledge HIV as gay men died young. Once powerful treatments were available in the 1990s and early 2000s, the public health establishment largely neglected Black people with HIV, especially in the South. In that period, the demographics of the epidemic shifted away from white, upper- and middle-class gay populations in liberal states. Half of new diagnoses today are in the South and a third are among people with low incomes.
When Sturdevant first tested positive for HIV in 2005, he didn’t seek treatment. He kept his diagnosis hidden from friends and family because he knew how people talked about HIV. They considered it a death sentence, a punishment for irresponsible behavior, or a disease that could infect them through a touch or a shared toilet seat — which it cannot.
“I thought my family was going to disown me,” he said.
A year later, his weight plummeted because he couldn’t hold down food or water. Gaunt and feverish, he went to the hospital and learned he had AIDS. His mother slept at his hospital bedside for two weeks: “She said, ‘God got you.’”
Once he regained his health, Sturdevant resolved to care for others in his position. Scientists had developed powerful HIV drugs that, if taken daily, transform it from a death sentence into a manageable chronic disease in which a person’s virus levels are so suppressed that they cannot spread HIV to others. And policymakers ensured that almost everyone in the U.S. with HIV could get treated regardless of their ability to pay, largely because of Medicaid and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.
But HIV experts had failed to overcome a key problem: Roughly a third of people living with HIV in the U.S. don’t get treated or don’t take the drugs regularly enough to be virally suppressed. Viral suppression rates are better in many African countries than in America.

To seek treatment and stick with it, Sturdevant understood, people had to have basic needs like food and housing met and, as importantly, a sense of belonging and empowerment. At his first job at an HIV organization in Jackson, Mississippi, Sturdevant regularly checked in with clients who didn’t have family members to support them. He hosted gatherings at his apartment and even offered it up as a place to stay. He has taken on the role of dad or uncle to many. “We called ourselves the family of love,” he said.
He saw how care bolstered lives, but the federal government needed data to drive its approach to HIV.
In 2012, the CDC expanded its in-depth surveys to learn more about the lives of people at risk of HIV and of those with HIV who weren’t virally suppressed. The surveys revealed what Sturdevant knew: A disproportionate number of them grappled with unstable housing, food insecurity, depression, and anxiety. Many participants agreed to prompts like, “Having HIV makes me feel that I’m a bad person,” or “Most people think that a person with HIV is disgusting,” or “Most people with HIV are rejected.”
The data showed policymakers that to curb the epidemic, they needed to address underlying problems that people with HIV faced. Federal funds began to flow to grassroots groups embedded in marginalized communities.
Public health researchers folded Black churches into the effort, recognizing them as hubs of volunteerism and as leaders of social movements. Although churches in the U.S. had historically fueled stigma against sexually transmitted diseases, Amy Nunn, a public health researcher at Brown University, said every pastor she talked with was eager to help. It paid off. In Kansas City, for example, researchers found that congregants who went to Black churches involved in HIV education and outreach were more than twice as likely to be tested.
Community-based interventions worked: New HIV infections dropped by 12% from 2018 to 2022.
Now the grassroots groups that have been so effective are in jeopardy and the in-depth surveys have halted as the Trump administration cuts funds and lays off CDC staff. Some health departments have issued stop-work orders to community-based groups that test people for HIV and connect them to treatment because federal HIV grants are unusually delayed. And as the Department of Health and Human Services continues to cancel HIV grants, the directors of grassroots groups anticipate more cuts.
“A lot of them are new and don’t have the resources to survive a year without funding,” said Masen Davis, executive director of Funders Concerned About AIDS.
One such group is Sturdevant’s.

‘Trust the process?’
In 2017, Sturdevant returned home to the Mississippi Delta to launch a nonprofit, Community Health PIER, in one of the poorest and most medically underserved parts of the country. The average life expectancy in the Delta is 68, a decade shorter than the national average. The disenfranchisement of its majority-Black population stems from the region’s history, in which policies concentrated wealth and power among the minority-white population during the era of cotton sharecropping, Jim Crow laws and segregation, and, recently, due to gerrymandering.
 
Sturdevant set up shop in Greenville, near a Black church that served as a headquarters for civil rights activists in the 1960s. In a small office, his team organizes health events, tests people for HIV, and connects those who test positive with treatment and housing assistance, funded through federal programs like Ryan White.
“Whites have been getting Ryan White and other programs for years and living healthy,” said Ashley Richardson, administrative assistant of Sturdevant’s group. “Around here, Black people are just now getting to the point where we know there are resources to help.”
Lately the team fields calls from people with HIV who are terrified they will lose their lifesaving drugs and housing if government programs no longer help with the cost.
Sturdevant worries about keeping his staff employed and his community safe. On the drive home from the April event in Washington, he drearily recounted conversations with Republicans in Congress: “They basically all said trust the process.”
The heads of national HIV organizations have stepped up their advocacy, asking Congress to oppose cuts in President Donald Trump’s budget request, said Gregorio Millett, director of public policy at the Foundation for AIDS Research, a nonprofit known as amfAR.
Emily Hilliard, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, responded to queries from KFF Health News by writing, “Critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue under the Administration for a Healthy America.” Yet the administration’s proposed budget for HIV prevention represents a 78% reduction compared with fiscal year 2025, according to a KFF analysis.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fostered skepticism  about scientific facts concerning HIV, without citing evidence. “Any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable-even dangerous-heresy among our reigning medical cartel,” he wrote in a 2021 book.
Not bowing to barriers
Researchers and HIV advocates are hashing out strategies to fill in the vacuum in HIV care that the government is poised to leave. For decades, it has driven priorities, coordinated a constellation of HIV groups, and tracked the epidemic. Leisha McKinley-Beach, CEO of a training institute, Black Public Health Academy, in Atlanta, said people must remember that wasn’t always the case.
“This massive industry we have today was created by committed individuals at the grassroots level, who were going to help people live with HIV or die with dignity, by any means necessary,” she said.
One idea is to have larger, established HIV organizations partner with nascent groups in underserved regions. The bigger ones stand a better chance of garnering significant private donations. And by taking on the fiscal management of grants, large groups could enable small ones to devote time to service rather than fundraising, McKinley-Beach said.
Another strategy, said Kathy Garner, executive director of Mississippi’s AIDS Services Coalition, is to fill gaps by coordinating with churches and nonprofits dedicated to food assistance, housing, or mental health.
“One of the solutions is going to be civil society stepping up,” Garner said. “That’s an old term for people taking care of each other, outside of the government.”
 
“We’re going to need to ramp up our services in all kinds of ways, and health and HIV will be a part of that,” said Bishop Ronnie Crudup of New Horizon Church International in Jackson, and a member of Mississippi Faith in Action, a coalition of African American churches involved in HIV.
“I have real concerns with what the Trump administration is doing, and how it will play out for the health of people in a poor state,” he said.
National groups, such as AIDS United, have been speaking with corporate funders and philanthropies about building a pooled fund to help sustain HIV organizations across the U.S.
Philanthropy for HIV has never come close to matching federal dollars, however. Non-governmental funders put $284 million toward HIV in the U.S. in 2023, compared with about $16 billion in annual federal funds for HIV in recent years.
“The truth is there is no way for philanthropy to make up for the cuts from the federal government,” Davis said. “I suspect we will see new infections rise within 18 months, which is heartbreaking.”
Sturdevant focuses on survival, not forecasts. “This isn’t going to be easy,” he said, “but we need to keep fighting for those who don’t have the fight in them.”

Retail fireworks sales started Tuesday ahead of Independence Day (July 4), with sales able to continue through July 5 on a July license, according to state law. The same law required such seasonal retail license applications — now $100 per stand, instead of $25 — to be received no later than June 9.
Other fireworks aficionados are also paying higher fees this season, such as jobbers at $400 (up from $200) and distributors at $1,000 (up from $500).

  State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who led the proposed fee increases through Legislative Bill 434 this year at the request of the State Fire Marshal’s Office, said this spring that the fees were a “critical need that has been overlooked for far too long.”
Wordekemper said, for instance, that some of the fire marshal’s state fees had not been changed since the 1980s or 1990s. The increases, he said, still wouldn’t keep up with the actual costs of such services.
“These fee increases are not taken lightly, but they are necessary to ensure the continued operation of vital safety services that protect our communities, schools, hospitals and businesses,” Wordekemper said in April.
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, vice chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, gave Wordekemper’s bill a boost on the floor saying that the alternative would be more funds from the state’s main pocketbook, fueled by sales and income taxes. She said the fee increases would not touch family homes.
Armendariz noted there is some “sticker shock” to some of the increases, but she and Wordekemper said that might not have been the case if the fees were more regularly updated.

A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-28 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How a trash plant and a ‘rat’ made their way into CT’s budget negotiations,John Moritz and Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/28/mira-hartford-torrington-legislature/,Hartford lost $3.25M to clean up site of former waste-to-energy plant after late budget amendment blocked sale of separate MIRA property to trash hauler.,"In one of their final acts of this year’s legislative session, Connecticut lawmakers voted to move forward with a long-awaited plan to breathe new life into an abandoned, rusting, trash-burning power plant that has loomed over Hartford’s South Meadows for more than a century.
In the process, however, they also waded into a latent dispute between local leaders in the capital city and the state’s rural northwestern hills, as well as two rival companies competing for rights to haul the trash produced by thousands of Connecticut residents.
The ramifications of that action — which passed with little note or fanfare at the time — have played out over the past week in a boardroom a few miles away from the ornate state Capitol Building.
In early June, as part of their latest two-year budget package, lawmakers voted to formally transfer ownership of the former Materials Innovation Recycling Authority, or MIRA, plant in Hartford’s South Meadows neighborhood to the Capital Region Development Authority, a quasi-public state agency that has overseen the redevelopment of other downtown projects and the management of two sports facilities, the XL Center and Rentschler Field.
During its final few decades as a waste-to-energy plant, the MIRA facility burned upwards of 700,000 tons of trash a year from residents in the Greater Hartford area and beyond. Before that it burned petroleum — and earlier, coal — to produce power.
As of now, neither the city nor the state have firm plans for the site, which exists on 80 acres along the Connecticut River. Officials, however, say their options include a mix of industrial, commercial or, if enough money is made available, residential uses.
“What is pretty clear is it’s not going to be a power plant,” said Michael Freimuth, the executive director of CRDA. “From there it’s pretty open.”
As part of the transfer, CRDA will inherit up to $47 million in reserves from the plant’s current owner, the MIRA Dissolution Authority, that was established in 2023 to wind down operations at South Meadows and other facilities operated by its predecessor. 
Those funds will be held in a separate account controlled by CRDA and used exclusively for the maintenance, cleanup and potential demolition of the power plant site, according to the legislation. Two full-time engineers currently employed at the site will also be hired CRDA as part of the move.
The MIRA Dissolution Authority itself will cease to exist as of midnight on July 1. As a result, its board has been involved in flurry of meetings at its office in the South Meadows regarding the remaining funds along with services at its two regional transfer stations.
“This site has for over a century, been a sort of dumping ground for the broader region,” said Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam. “Even in kind of industrial times, in the 19th Century, ships, commercial ships, would dump stuff in on that site.”
The result of that history, the mayor said, is a level environmental contamination that is sure to complicate any efforts to redevelop the property. For generations, children who grew up adjacent to the plant’s fuming smokestacks have reported higher rates of asthma.
“Now that it’s been shut down, we’re going to be left trying to figure out what will happen next,” Arulampalam said.
‘Immaculate Amendment’
Apart from the former waste-to-energy facility in Hartford, the MIRA Dissolution Authority also owns and operates a transfer station in Torrington as well as buildings and equipment at the town of Essex’s transfer station.
Determining the future of those two those stations — which collectively serve 23 mostly-smaller towns, and handle roughly 63,000 tons of trash annually — has been part of the authority’s work for the past two years. For Essex, a relatively straightforward plan was approved this week to transfer the remainder of MIRA’s property to the town, which will operate the plant under an existing contract with CWPM Waste Management.
In Torrington, however, dueling proposals to either sell the transfer station or keep it operating as a public facility have split local leaders in Hartford and the state’s Northwest Corner.
Under a so-called “private option,” the transfer station would be leased or sold to an Enfield company, USA Waste and Recycling, for $3.25 million. That money, in turn, would have been added to the reserves available to remediate the site of MIRA’s shuttered waste-to-energy plant in Hartford.
But several towns in that area have expressed concerns about rising tipping fees and USA Waste’s growing presence in the local trash-hauling industry. That’s led some local leaders to propose creating their own regional waste authority to take over the transfer station — the alternative “public option.”
During meeting in May, several members of the MIRA Dissolution Authority said that while they support the desire for the public option, getting such a regional authority up and running would have required an estimated $4.4 million in subsidies from MIRA’s remaining reserves.
As a result, the board voted to support selling the transfer station, pending a final round of negotiations with USA Waste and Recycling.
Then, a few weeks later amid the frenetic rush to wrap-up this year’s legislative session, an amendment was added to the state’s sprawling budget bill that transferred the Torrington station’s operating permit to the towns’ newly-created Northwest Resource Recovery Authority — throwing a wrench into MIRA Dissolution Authority’s plan to sell the facility.
In addition to the Torrington transfer station, the amendment also added language directing the commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to issue a temporary operating permit to the owner of a transfer station in Wallingford. 
Multiple lawmakers — including leaders of all four legislative caucuses — told the Connecticut Mirror this week they were unaware of the exact origins of the permit language, which will go into effect when once Gov. Ned Lamont signs the budget into law as expected.
“I call it the immaculate amendment,” said Bert Hunter, the chair of MIRA Dissolution Authority’s board of directors.
On Friday, however, the provenance of that amendment became clearer when Joseph Mazzarella, a lawyer and partner at McCarter & English, said he wrote letters seeking its inclusion to Courtney Cullinan and Franklin Perry, the chiefs of staff, respectively, for the Senate and House Democratic majorities.
Mazzarella said he was acting on behalf of a client, Richard Antonucci Jr. of waste services operator Country Holdings LLC., who he said has been fighting to establish a presence in the region’s trash disposal and recycling business in competition with USA Waste and its affiliates. Mazzarella acknowleged that the language was intended to block the sale of the Torrington transfer station to his client’s rival, which he said would have resulted in the further consolidation of the trash business.
“How can that be good?” Mazzarella said.
McCarter & English also employs the Senate Democrats former chief of staff, Vincent Mauro, as a government affairs adviser. He referred questions to Mazzarella.
Prior to speaking to Mazzarella, CT Mirror asked Senate Democrats’ chief of staff Cullinan about the language that was inserted into the budget. “I heard about it, but I am not necessarily familiar with it,” she said, and promised to look into the matter.
Later, CT Mirror reached out again to Cullinan again to ask about the letters Mazzarella said he sent her. Cullinan responded in a text offering to share a copy of the letter, but did not say whether she took any action in response to it.
Perry, the House Democrats’ chief of staff, did not respond to a request for comment.
In addition to its interest in the Torrington facility, Mazzarella said Country Holdings purchased a site in Wallingford that once housed a trash incinerator — and later, a transfer station — which had accumulated waste under the control of a previous operator, drawing a notice of violation by DEEP. 
The language inserted in the budget restored the Wallingford facility’s operating permit to Country Holdings — further easing the company’s attempts to establish a regional presence in recycling and waste disposal.
Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, a long-serving lawmaker and environmentalist, said Friday she was uncertain if the end result of the maneuver ultimately would be deemed good public policy. “Too soon to tell. I put a call into DEEP to see what they think as regulators,” Mushinsky said.
But she had no qualms in criticizing the method employed.
“They snuck it in. We only get a couple of hours” to review the final budget document, she said. “Sometimes people sneak things in at the last minute, and that’s what happened here.”
In a statement Friday evening, DEEP spokesman James Fowler said the agency neither negotiated nor reviewed the language prior to its inclusion in the budget. He added that the agency is working with the Department of Administrative Services to “facilitate the continued operation” of the Torrington facility, while reviewing the language involving the Wallingford facility with the offices of the governor and the attorney general.
The move also frustrated officials in Hartford, including Arulampalam, who said it in effect took away the $3.25 million the sale would have generated for cleanup efforts in the city’s South Meadows neighborhood.
Hunter, meanwhile, said the MIRA Dissolution Authority board had examined a number of pathways to move forward with either the public or private option following the legislature’s action. But due to the legal complexities and sudden costs involved, the board on Thursday decided to take no action on either proposal.
As a result, the Torrington transfer station will automatically revert to the state’s Department of Administrative Services on July 1. Its continued operations will be left up to the agency, leaving the door open for Country Holdings to bid for any future contracts.
“We didn’t take a vote. We just had a sense that we just couldn’t, we couldn’t get there,” Hunter said. “There was just not it wasn’t enough support [for either proposal]”
The shift is not expected to impact trash-hauling operations for the time being, Hunter said. A spokesman for DAS said Friday that the state’s “commitment is to ensure secure and efficient continuity of all operations, including the Torrington transfer station, in accordance with all statutes and regulations. We continue to work closely with DEEP and other partners and contractors to meet that commitment.” 
The chief executive of USA Waste and Recycling did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. But the company’s attorney, Ed Spinella, ripped into lawmakers’ “rat amendment” during a meeting of the MIRA Dissolution Authority’s board on June 18.
“We were going to buy the [Torrington] facility regardless of whether or not it had a permit,” Spinella said, promising to hold the board to its earlier vote supporting the private option. “It’s an enforceable vote, and I guarantee you I’m going to make in enforceable.”
Neither the leader of the Northwest Hills Council of Governments, Robert Phillips, or Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone responded to requests for comment on Friday.
Cleaning up
The MIRA plant was originally built in the 1920s to provide power to the growing city of Hartford. Later, in the 1980s, it was reconfigured to offer a solution to another one of the state’s vexing problems: trash piling up in stinking, unsightly landfills. By the late 2010s, however, the age of the facility and competition with cheaper power sources made it uneconomical to run. Operations at the plant finally ceased on July 19, 2022.
Since then, the MIRA Dissolution Authority has worked with DEEP to remediate the property to an industrial or commercial standard, according to Hunter. Contaminants on the site include asbestos, lead paint and chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
Any future development plans that involve tearing down the hulking former power plant, or digging up contaminated soils to build the foundation for new buildings, are expected to drive up the cost of that remediation, officials say. 
Freimuth, the director of CRDA, compared the task to one undertaken by the authority’s predecessor in the mid-2000s to redevelop a section of Hartford now known as Adriaen’s Landing, home to a hotel, convention center and the Connecticut Science Center.
“This area that I’m sitting in right now [was] very similar in characteristics to what the South Meadows looks like: an energy area, tank farms, coal slurry, you know, all kinds of stuff,” Freimuth said. “The logic was: this is very similar to the tasks and the process, so let’s use the agency that did it once before.”
In March, the MIRA Dissolution Authority released a 1,535-page report on the potential for future development at the South Meadows site. That report estimated that demolition and cleanup of the site would cost between $48 million and $334 million, with the highest estimates associated with plans that included multifamily housing.
Due to those likely costs, some local leaders have said plans should instead focus on industrial and commercial uses that have long found a home in the South Meadows.
“It’s probably too expensive to be residential,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford. “It’s probably going to be a long haul.” 
Mayor Arulampalam, however said he wanted planners to look at creative solutions — such as capping the most polluted sections of the property with parking lots, while leaving others open to more expansive development — which could keep costs down.
“Are there open-space uses for parts of the property?” Arulampalam said. “Is there some mixture of commercial and residential that could kind of work in tandem, and based on the physical design features, maybe help mitigate some of the larger costs of remediation?”
Adding to the complexity of redeveloping the site is its location adjacent to the Hartford-Brainard Airport, which mostly serves smaller, civil aircraft. The legislation transferring ownership of the plant to CRDA prohibits the authority from taking any action that would conflict with federal laws or regulations concerning the airport.
“Realistically, you’ve got height restrictions and things of that nature, that you have to accommodate for,” Freimuth said, adding that it would likely be another three to five years before actual development could begin on the property. 
While Arulampalam said he was disappointed by lawmakers’ decision to block the sale of the Torrington property, he said he was supportive of the broader decision to endow CRDA with a $47 million to move forward with the long-awaited cleanup of the MIRA plant.
“In many ways, in a small snapshot, you could focus on the $3.25 million that city lost out on, and it feels frustrating to me as mayor to have had that happen,” Arulampalam said. 
But, he added, “This story has played out in numerous places like Hartford across the country, and typically there isn’t any effort to remedy the wrongs of the past.
“I think this is a real win for environmental justice. I think it’s a real win for some form of repairing this massive environmental contaminant that the city of Hartford has had to bear the brunt of for the region for far too long. It’s not a full victory, but it is more of a victory than cities like us usually get,” Arulampalam said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MIRA-DISSOLUTION-0630-DE-108-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 06:58:41.726367

Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon attend an event for the Make America Healthy Again Commission report in the East Room of the White House on May 22, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Our nation’s founders embraced equality as a guiding principle in the Declaration of Independence with these words: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights.”
Abraham Lincoln gave meaning to the founders’ words while on the campaign trail in 1857; he countered the infamous Dred Scott decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared that persons imported from Africa, whether free or enslaved, were not American citizens.
Lincoln responded that the nation’s founders saw equality as an aspiration of American democracy:
“They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society … constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.”
Critical steps in removing barriers to equality would be taken through constitutional change only after a bitterly fought Civil War. Three post-war amendments sought to make people of color in the US more equal, specifically:

The 13th Amendment (1865) abolishing slavery;
the 14th Amendment (1868) providing that all persons born or naturalized in the US, including formerly enslaved persons, are citizens and are guaranteed equal protection under the law; and
the 15th Amendment (1870) specifying that US citizens shall not be denied the right to vote on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.

Major steps toward advancing equality were taken in the 20th century through Social Security (1935), Medicare (1965) and Medicaid (1965).
The Social Security Act equalizes access to income support for seniors, the unemployed, families with dependent children and people with disabilities. Seventy-million Americans rely on Social Security benefits each month, and nearly 590,000 Kansans receive monthly benefits through social security.
Medicare equalizes access to health care primarily for seniors and disabled persons, and Medicaid equalizes access to health care for poor and disabled persons. Seventy-million Americans are now enrolled in Medicare, and 70 million Americans are covered by Medicaid. More than 570,000 Kansans are enrolled in Medicare, and more than 350,000 Kansans are covered by Medicaid.
The nation has made historic commitments to equalize access to civil rights, specifically through:

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which guarantees access to public accommodations, education and employment for those discriminated against as a result of race, color, religion, sex or national origin;
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, which assures access to the ballot box for those denied access as a result of race or color; and
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which provides access to employment, public accommodations, transportation and telecommunications for persons with disabilities.

President Donald Trump has declared war on equality as an aspiration for American democracy. He has twisted civil rights protections inside out: from safeguards intended to uphold the rights of people of color, women, and disabled persons to a protection for white men.
Trump has ordered that:

Initiatives in diversity, equity, and inclusion are illegal and immoral and should be terminated both within and outside of government;
Evidence of inequalities in the form of “disparate impact” be banned from use in determining discrimination against minority groups and people of color;
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stop assisting state and local civil rights offices from investigating discrimination based on disparate impact; and
The Department of Justice “modify, rescind, or move to conclude” consent decrees or agreements designed to eliminate racial discrimination in local police departments and as a result such measures were subsequently abandoned.

Trump appointees have turned civil rights offices in departments of Justice, Education, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission away from addressing claims of discrimination by people of color and women toward complaints against measures that advance diversity, equity, and inclusion for such groups. They have also used federal grants and contracts as leverage to force schools, colleges and universities to abandon initiatives related to diversity, equity and inclusion, whether federally funded or not, and terminate grants or contracts concerned with equity.
In Trump’s world, even the celebration of achievement of those from marginalized groups is viewed as diminishing white people.
Our nation’s drive for equality over two and a half centuries now permeates our government and institutions throughout society. Trump acts out of ignorance against our determination and may temporarily disrupt progress. I remain confident, however, that he can never bend the arc of history away from our aspiration for equality.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trumprfkmcmahon-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 05:00:27.822190

For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Budget panels in both chambers of the Legislature in late-night votes Friday approved an annual spending bill that Senate Democrats have said will cost $58.8 billion.
Legislators’ proposal spends more than the plan Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled in late February, leaves the state with a surplus too small to meet a statutory requirement for a new tax relief program, and expands New Jersey’s deficit to $1.5 billion (Murphy proposed $1.2 billion).
If the budget stands at $58.8 billion, it would amount to the highest level in state history. The full Legislature is expected to give the plan a final vote on Monday. The next fiscal year begins Tuesday.
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) on Friday read aloud a statement from an absent Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair.
“This is a budget that will help move New Jersey forward in the face of difficult fiscal conditions and severe economic uncertainty. We are making the best use of resources to address the priority needs of the state’s residents in a fiscally responsible way,” the statement read. 
On net, lawmakers’ changes to Murphy’s proposed budget add $728 million in spending beyond what the governor sought, and while the total effect of their revenue raisers was not immediately clear, the state appears poised to take in less money from recurring revenue than under the governor’s proposal.
Republican officials, in what has become a yearly rejoinder, criticized the late-night budget votes, which were held before bill text was available to the public. Members of the press received copies of the spending bill at 8:37 p.m. Friday, but the bills were not posted online Friday.
“It’s the complete opposite of what good government looks like,” said Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris). “Their rushed, opaque budget charade is exactly why New Jersey is in the fiscal mess we’ve found ourselves in. There’s no accountability, no planning, and absolutely no transparency, just last-minute deals and political favors pushed through in the dead of night when no one is looking.”

Friday’s vote by the Senate’s budget committee capped an unusual process that began when the panel met on Thursday but ended its meeting without a vote on the budget. Instead of adjourning, the committee took a 24-hour-long recess that allowed members who would not be present Friday, like Sarlo, to record their votes early on a budget bill that did not yet exist.
Witnesses and lawmakers praised the budget’s full $7.2 billion pension payment, and the more than $12 billion it sets aside for formulaic school aid. However, some expressed concern that the state would still spend more than it brings in.
“I appreciate the responsible side of this budget where it’s full pension payment, it’s a full school aid payment, a healthier surplus than we’re used to, but there’s no signs of the structural reforms we truly need to give our next governor a healthier budget,” said Chris Emigholz, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), her chamber’s budget chair, said the state’s next governor, who will take office in January, would need to determine whether some programs should be jettisoned. Murphy is barred from seeking a third term in November.
“Whoever comes in, I think that there’s going to be some decisions that are going to have to be made. I think whether it’s a Republican or a Democrat, they’re going to have to take a look at especially some of the senior proposals just to see what we can do,” she said.
Much of the new spending comes from legislative add-ons — variably called district spending, Christmas tree items, or simply “pork.”
Those items are numerous and varied, and their costs total in the hundreds of millions. They include millions in capital funding to individual school districts, like the $21 million Newark schools will receive, or for local infrastructure projects, like $8 million set aside for roadway improvements in Camden.
Other changes would undo cuts to college financial assistance for students and reverse a $20 million cut Murphy proposed to community colleges’ operating aid. Those cuts had rankled lawmakers and spurred alarm from university leaders.
The budget would pull an additional $70 million from the state’s clean energy fund to pay for salaries at NJ Transit, plus an additional $50 million to underwrite more general state spending. NJ Transit was already set to receive a separate $70.1 million from the fund as part of an annual diversion.
The bill assumes the state will find $100 million in savings on state employees’ health care benefits in the first six months of 2026, though it provides no suggestion for how officials realize such savings. Instead, it asks state and public employee representatives to each submit their own plans.
The boosted spending would take the state’s surplus to $6.7 billion, according to budget documents that had not undergone technical review by the Office of Legislative Services.
Lawmakers augmented reserves by increasing a diversion from a debt defeasance fund — which is meant to reduce debt payments by immediately paying debt down or avoiding it altogether — to $555 million, from $250 million.
The proposed level of surplus should trigger a statutory provision to pause payments from Stay NJ, a nascent property tax relief program that promises to cut seniors’ property tax bills in half. The provision is intended to halt the program if the state doesn’t have enough money to pay for it, but lawmakers have previously overwritten it.
The budget includes a range of new or increased taxes, including a hike to rates paid on cigarettes, electronic cigarette fluid, high-dollar property sales, and casinos’ online wagering wins.
Lawmakers followed Murphy’s lead on nicotine taxes, exactly matching proposals he made in his budget message, but approved lower tax rates for casinos’ online wagering wins than the governor had sought. Those rates rise to 19.75% in lawmakers’ budget plan, rather than the 25% Murphy pitched.
Legislators made broader changes to a surcharge on realty transfers of more than $1 million.
Rather than doubling that tax rate to 2% and imposing a 3% rate on property sales worth more than $2 million, legislators voted to raise rates to 2% for sales worth between $2 million and $2.5 million and increase them by an additional half percentage point for every $500,000 in additional value, to a cap of 3.5% at $3.5 million.
Their proposal also calls for property sellers, rather than buyers, to pay the fee, a change that would decrease upfront costs for those buying buildings worth at least $1 million and reduce the profits from such property sales.
Legislators eschewed some taxes sought by Murphy. They skipped a proposed 10% hike to the state’s alcoholic beverage tax that was forecast to boost collections by $18.5 million. They also declined to enact a per-truck warehousing fee estimated to generate $20 million in revenue.
A degree of uncertainty remains around the budget. GOP lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are exploring broad changes to federal programs that could pull billions in federal Medicaid funding, among other things, from New Jersey.
“In many ways, this budget may be a hypothetical document,” said Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “When those cuts start coming, we’ll have to come up with the revenue somewhere. Otherwise, we will face devastating cuts to many of the programs that we all hold dear.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0JS11345_1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-28 02:59:59.733848

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, coupled with an executive order by President Donald Trump, has created doubt about the future of American citizenship for Alaskans who are the children of immigrants.
In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that U.S. District Court judges cannot issue nationwide preliminary injunctions.
In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring that the federal government would end birthright citizenship — the awarding of American citizenship to every person born in the United States — for the children of non-citizen immigrants. 
The new Supreme Court decision has significant implications for Alaska in particular, because it is not among the states that have legal challenges against Trump’s executive order.
Since 1898, the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted by courts as offering birthright citizenship to the children of all American residents, regardless of immigration status. 
Trump’s order would change the federal government’s interpretation. It declares that citizenship would be limited to the children of citizens and lawful permanent residents, which would exclude refugees, and other people in the United States temporarily, as well as undocumented immigrants.
That change has been blocked nationwide since January by numerous district court judges.
Friday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court means that those judges can no longer block the order nationwide; they can only block it in states whose district courts are considering lawsuits that challenge the Trump order.
As of Friday, 22 states have legal challenges against the Trump order. 
Twenty-eight states, including Alaska, have not. In those states, the Trump administration can start, in 30 days, to begin implementing the executive order, the court said.
The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Trump administration’s executive order, which could be overturned at a later date.
Neither the office of Gov. Mike Dunleavy nor Attorney General Treg Taylor answered emailed questions asking whether they intend to file a lawsuit in order to protect newborn Alaskans’ citizenship.
Mara Kimmel, the executive director of the Alaska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said by email that her organization “anticipates this decision could have devastating impacts in Alaska and we are monitoring this very closely as we determine a path forward to protect Alaskan families.”
Meghan Barker, communications and engagement director for the ACLU of Alaska, said that the ACLU nationally has already filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to represent people nationwide, including Alaskans.
“We’re closely following the situation and litigation to ensure that no Alaskans lose their citizenship,” she said.

MCSO is currently exploring an agreement with Biometrica, a data company that provides facial recognition technology to local police departments. 
“Facial recognition technology has been proven to disproportionately affect communities of color and young women,” said Sup. Juan Miguel Martinez. “The more facial recognition technology, the more people are able to criminalize people executing their First Amendment rights. I feel this is an issue not left or right.” Miguel Martinez also expressed concerns about the use of facial recognition technology to aid immigration enforcement or to surveil protests. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Privacy concerns have been heightened during the Trump administration’s surge in immigration enforcement and crackdowns on dissent. In Milwaukee, several people were arrested by federal agents after attending regular hearings at the county courthouse. In April, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and accused of obstructing federal agents after she directed a man sought by immigration officers out a side door in her courtroom that led into a public hallway. 
MCSO leaders said they aim to use the technology to identify people after violent crime incidents. 
Nevertheless, members of the public and some elected officials raised concerns about the technology.  The resolution contains language stating  that facial recognition technology can be inaccurate and could negatively affect certain groups including people of color, LGBTQ people, activists, immigrants and people seeking reproductive health care. 
The resolution states that the county board supports pausing any future acquisition of facial recognition until regulatory policies can be developed. It also calls on the county’s Information Management Services Division, Corporation Council and MCSO to collaborate with “relevant stakeholders” including privacy and free speech advocates, in developing that policy framework. Out of this collaborative effort will eventually emerge recommendations to the county board as to whether facial recognition technology:

Should be prohibited or strictly limited without the informed knowledge and consent of the individual being scanned, except under narrowly defined circumstances, such as during active criminal investigations, 
Whether the types of data collected by the technology should be defined and limited, as well as strict retention periods for data, 
Prohibit facial recognition data from being shared with third parties, unless authorized through a rigorous, transparent approval process which itself would be subject to oversight, 
And whether departments using facial recognition should be required to submit annual reports detailing its use, including metrics of deployment, effectiveness, and analysis on the impact on communities of color, immigrants and other vulnerable groups.  

The resolution passed by the county board calls for a final recommendation to be established no later than May 2026. By December 2025 the county board expects a status update, according to the resolution.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon appears poised to leave Congress in early 2027. 
One House Republican strategist who works on campaigns across the country said Bacon was not running for reelection and that he had already telegraphed what he was going to do. He spoke to the Examiner Friday on the condition that he not be named publicly, because he was not authorized to share the decision. 
“Don’t get me wrong,” the consultant said. “This seat is tougher without Bacon, but he’s not special. It can be done.” 
Five other local Republican sources familiar with Bacon’s choice confirmed that he had decided to skip the 2026 race. They echoed Friday evening reports from Washington, D.C., including from Punchbowl News. 
No immediate comment
Bacon’s campaign had no immediate comment on the reports. But people who know politics in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District had been buzzing for days about the possibility of Bacon making a decision as soon as next week. Bacon had planned to meet with local reporters early next week. 
Part of the buzz came from a group of Nebraska Republicans waiting on Bacon’s decision, a list that local conservatives have said includes former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding, and might also include Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei. 
Bacon, in recent interviews with the Nebraska Examiner and other publications, had been hinting that he might step away, with the retired Air Force brigadier saying that he had to speak with his family and decide. Bacon’s decision would cause national political shockwaves, as Bacon represents one of a handful of true swing districts left nationally, one that is Nebraska’s most political divided and diverse. 
Diverse swing district
The 2nd District includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and a significant slice of western suburban and rural Sarpy County. The district includes the state’s largest concentration of Democrats and was redistricted to include a larger swath of Republican-leaning rural voters in Wahoo and surrounding areas. 
Neither the Nebraska Republican Party nor the National Republican Congressional Committee had any immediate comment.
“The writing has been on the wall for months,” said Madison Andrus, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of congressional Democrats. 
Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, tweeted after Punchbowl News’ Jake Sherman tweeted the news that local Democrats have been ready.
“Don Bacon and all the Republicans who give Trump cover see the writing on the wall–voters actually want politicians to focus on issues that impact our pocket books not made up culture wars,” she said. 
Candidates lining up
She touted the Democrats who have already announced, including political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. Before word of Bacon’s future broke on Friday, a third major Democrat confirmed she is considering a bid, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades.
Powell, in a statement, thanks Bacon for his service in the military and in Congress and said it “takes courage to recognize when a fresh perspective is warranted.”
“This district is clearly ready for — and deserves — change,” Powell said.
Cavanaugh, in a statement, thanked Bacon “for his decades of service to his country” and wished him well. 
“The people of Nebraska’s 2nd District know it’s time for a change,” Cavanaugh said.
Rhoades, in a statement, said Bacon had “finally realized what has been obvious to all of us: Republicans can’t defend their record this year.” 
“Costs are going up, they’re cutting healthcare, but they’re giving tax breaks to billionaires,” Rhoades said.
Bacon has been able to fend off multiple Democratic challengers in recent years, thanks in part to the district’s slight GOP tilt. Now, it could be a mad dash for both parties toward an open seat. 
National attention
The retired Air Force brigadier general gained national attention for being one of the few Republicans to criticize President Donald Trump, though, despite Bacon’s criticism, he often ended up siding with his party as a reliable GOP vote. He survived pointed criticism from Trump and multiple attempts to recruit a GOP challenger from the president and his political team. 
Bacon most recently defeated former State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha in back-to-back elections. Before that, he defeated Omaha progressive Kara Eastman in two successive contests. And he won election in 2016 by defeating the last Democrat to hold the “blue dot” seat, the late-U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb.
Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running. 
Whoever emerges from the 2026 Democratic primary will have to tangle with a former gubernatorial candidate in Lindstrom, a longtime City Council member in Harding or perhaps a state officeholder on the Republican side.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report just shifted the Omaha-based House to lean Democrat from lean Republican.

Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, was not recently using an Instagram account responsible for an antisemitic comment. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan issued a statement Friday saying he had “definitive proof” that Del. Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, was not recently using an Instagram account responsible for an antisemitic comment last week. 
McGeehan did not respond to an emailed request to provide that evidence and could not be reached by phone Friday.
In his statement, McGeehan said Masters provided him with a screenshot of the account that showed “irregular activity.” That screenshot was not included in the release and he did not explain specifically what it showed.
McGeehan also claimed that the person who did make the comment from the profile @NoQuarterMasters — which bore Masters’ full name, a link to an organization he ran for about 10 years and a profile picture with a letter addressed to “Ian” surrounded by symbols associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideals — has been identified. 
The responsible person, according to McGeehan, was “someone with no current relation to [Masters] and his district, or anyone else in the WV Republican Party.” He offered no other details.
In his comments Friday, McGeehan called out Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin and Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia — the only two Jewish members of the state Legislature — by name, saying they were “not interested in the truth” about who really left the antisemitic comment.
“They make these deceptive accusations because they desire power and social status at the expense of others,” McGeehan wrote. 
Earlier this week, Pushkin called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey to “show moral leadership” and ask for Masters’ resignation unless evidence could be provided showing definitively that he did not make the comment. The state Democratic Party also urged House Speaker Roger Hanshaw in a letter to “take swift action” against Masters and fully investigate the incident.
On Friday, Pushkin released another statement that questioned why McGeehan did not release the proof. 
“If the responsible party has been ‘identified,’ why has no name been released and no explanation given as to how that determination was made?” Pushkin asked. “Until that happens — and unless that evidence is presented clearly and publicly — McGeehan’s statements amount to little more than a dog whistle meant to distract from serious concerns about antisemitism and white supremacy by a member of the House of Delegates.”
The Instagram account @NoQuarterMasters left the antisemitic comment on a months-old Instagram post about Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy on June 21. The comment said “[Portnoy is] not white. He’s a Jew. We never claimed them. That’s why he’s short tiny and weak.”
  A screenshot taken Monday of the comment left by @NoQuarterMasters three days ago in response to another user’s 10-weeks-old comment on a video about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, denies leaving the comment.
West Virginia Watch first reported the comment and the links between Masters and the profile that left it on Tuesday. In an interview that day, Masters said he did not have “any active Instagram account” and was not responsible for the comment.
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw told MetroNews Talkline on Wednesday that Masters told him he was “previously affiliated” with the @NoQuarterMasters account but wasn’t anymore and denied “having connection” to the antisemitic comment. 
“He was surprised to see it,” Hanshaw said. “When [Masters] and I spoke earlier [Wednesday], he indicated that he could not actually log into the account when he tried to do so because, apparently, the password had been changed and he had to seek technical assistance to even be able to reset a password.”
The last two digits of the phone number used for password recovery on the account were the same as on Masters’ personal cell phone on Tuesday.
During his interview with West Virginia Watch, Masters did not acknowledge any familiarity with the account’s handle or any previous affiliation with it. 
In 2023, multiple Instagram posts from the West Virginia Citizens Defense League — where Masters served as president from 2015 to 2025 — showed captions signed off by “Ian T. Masters, Esq.” and @NoQuarterMasters tagged in photos alongside accounts with the same names of other officers for the organization.
Several photos on his wife’s public Instagram from 2021-23 show photos of Masters tagged as @NoQuarterMasters. 
  Del. Ian T. Masters was tagged in photos as @noquartermasters on his wife’s Instagram account.
Before speaking to West Virginia Watch on Tuesday, the name on the account — separate from the handle — read “Ian T. Masters” and a link to the Citizens Defense League’s website was included in the bio. After the interview but before the story was published that day, the account’s name changed to “I. Masters” and the link was removed. By Tuesday night, the name was changed back to “Ian T. Masters.”
On Tuesday morning, the @NoQuarterMasters profile, which is private, was shown to have 1,498 posts and 367 followers. By 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, the number of posts had dropped to 1,368 — meaning more than 100 posts were deleted — and the follower count dropped to 276. As of Friday afternoon, the account only showed 39 followers.
  Between Tuesday and Friday, Masters’ number of photos decreased by about 100, and his follower count went from 367 to 39.
On Wednesday, the state Democratic Party called on Hanshaw to conduct a “legitimate investigation” into the comment and Masters’ links to the account — including the profile picture that shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in Chester, West Virginia. Per reporting by West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Masters’ LinkedIn says he worked in Chester from 2016-19. 
The letter is partially covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals. 
  A screenshot of the profile picture used on the @NoQuarterMasters Instagram account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in West Virginia and several runes described by the Anti-Defamation League as being associated antisemitic views and groups.
“Keep in mind that Delegate Masters’ Instagram account didn’t just post an antisemitic statement. It also has white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and antisemitic symbols,” Hansen said in a statement Friday.  “Legislative leadership should condemn these actions. And they should perform a full investigation with findings released to the public, rather than trying to turn this into a partisan issue.”
Pushkin earlier this week outlined specific steps that state Democrats say Hanshaw should take to clear Masters’ name, including: performing a “full forensic investigation” of Masters’ devices, social media accounts and email; seeking an explanation of the account’s profile picture and the symbols within it as well as how the name and bio on the account were changed after his interview with West Virginia Watch.
“[G]iven the gravity of what’s alleged, an investigation cannot simply mean asking the Delegate, ‘Did you do it?’ and taking ‘No’ for an answer. We need to get to the truth,” Pushkin said. “West Virginians deserve to know whether an individual chosen to serve in the House of Delegates has used his platform to promote hate, bigotry, and extremism.”
McGeehan on Friday called Pushkin a “professional victim” who was trying to “manipulate” the situation as state Democrats are currently in litigation regarding Masters’ House seat.
Masters was appointed to the House by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in January after delegate-elect Joseph de Soto was accused of threatening to harm and kill lawmakers. Spokespeople for Morrisey have yet to respond to requests for comment regarding the allegations against Masters.
De Soto won the November 2024 election as a Republican but switched his party affiliation to Democratic shortly before being arrested for making terroristic threats. 
House Republicans in January voted to vacate the seat instead of expelling de Soto, saying it was the correct way to deal with the seat since de Soto was on house arrest and never sworn in. The vacate move prompted a legal challenge from the state Democratic Party, who argued that the seat should have gone to Democrats due to de Soto’s party switch.
The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled against state Democrats in one of their challenges over the seat, however other challenges are still pending.

Anthony said renewable power, coupled with battery storage, will “play an important part in power generation in the near future.” (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)In a letter to Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, Gov. Josh Shapiro warned there could be consequences to eliminating clean energy tax credits.
“Over $3 billion in direct investment in Pennsylvania energy projects would be undermined by H.R. 1’s tax increases,” Shapiro wrote. “That includes potential impacts to over 70 facilities that have been announced across the commonwealth, directly threatening more than 26,000 jobs by 2030 due to the effective tax hikes.”
H.R. 1, the budget bill containing many of the Trump administration’s domestic policy priorities, would eliminate a number of tax credits for renewable energy projects, many of which were created by the Democratic-led Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro warned the hardest impact would fall on those slated to open soon. In the House version, most of the clean energy tax credits would end abruptly, instead of in 2032, when they were initially set to expire.
The Senate version is slightly more lenient. Tax credits for wind and solar projects would instead be phased out, with decreasing credits for projects that break ground in 2026 and 2027.
The Senate also moved to keep certain tax credits for nuclear, hydropower, battery and geothermal projects until 2034. Shapiro applauded this change.
Still, he specifically addressed several that have already been announced, which he said could suffer under the changes. That includes two projects in Clearfield County that he noted are collectively anticipated to create more than 900 jobs.
Shapiro said the bill could also effectively end state programs designed to help community institutions lower their energy bills. He said the Solar for Schools program, for example, could potentially lose over $30 million.
The proposed budget also eliminates consumer-focused tax credits for new and used electric vehicle purchases as well as home energy efficiency and clean energy conversion projects.

Bob Ferguson vetoed its funding and the state abruptly canceled its contract. 
And a group of GOP lawmakers is urging Ferguson to find a way to keep the Kent facility operating.
For decades, the Pediatric Interim Care Center has tended to babies born to mothers with substance use disorder. Just under half of its annual $1.7 million budget has usually come from the state, said Development Director Elaine Purchase. Fundraising makes up the rest.
But this year, lawmakers slashed that funding to $100,000 in the face of a steep budget shortfall. The facility, known as PICC, was ready to make do with the deep cut and dip into its reserves, with the hope of making up for it when the Legislature returns next year. 
Then last month, Ferguson vetoed even that $100,000, as part of a slew of small items he removed to save money in the $78 billion two-year spending plan. 
And soon after, Purchase was “blindsided” when the state Department of Children, Youth and Families cut its contract with the nursery, meaning no more babies would be referred there starting July 1.
“Which basically destroys our program,” Purchase said. “Why would they abandon it for $100,000?”
In a statement, the Department of Children, Youth and Families argued the center’s state funding was “not cost-effective.” Secretary Tana Senn said the center received money for its 13 beds regardless of how many babies it was serving, and didn’t meet requirements to get Medicaid funding.
“We also want to clarify that DCYF is not shutting down the Kent PICC,” said Senn, a former state lawmaker. “They can still accept referrals from hospitals and have informed DCYF on multiple occasions that they have sufficient charitable funding to continue serving children.”
On Friday, state House Republican leadership, including Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, of Auburn, took issue with the rationale and urged the state agency and Ferguson to reverse course.
“Governor Ferguson, throughout your first legislative session as governor, you said that you just wanted to do things that are ‘common sense,’” the half-dozen lawmakers wrote. “What is more common sense than using the power you hold to save the lives of innocent newborn babies?”
The facility, open for 35 years, was caring for just one newborn Friday, said Purchase. It has been underused as the focus has shifted to keeping babies with their parents. 
Research has indicated parental involvement is integral in an infant’s development. 
“New evidence-based models demonstrate better outcomes for babies when they ‘room in’ at hospitals under the care of a physician or are in transitional care homes that allow the mother and baby to stay together,” Senn said.
“While hospitals, of course, may choose to continue to refer children to the Kent PICC, they have been doing so much less frequently as demonstrated by the current empty beds at the Kent PICC,” the agency secretary continued. “Instead, hospitals more often refer infants to other facilities that use the current standard of care.”
In 2021, the Legislature passed a measure known as the Keeping Families Together Act to help relatives take care of children who can’t stay with their parents and to reduce racial disparities in the child welfare system. Critics blame the bipartisan law for a reported increase in child deaths, including from drug exposure.
The average stay for babies at the Kent pediatric care center is 30 to 40 days. Most are exposed to fentanyl or methamphetamine. Since opening in 1990, the facility says it has cared for over 3,500 babies.
“We just want there to be a safe place for these little ones,” Purchase said.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Utah News Dispatch claimed 12 awards, including four first-place wins, in this year’s Utah Headliners statewide journalism contest, which recognizes top journalism in writing and reporting, TV, radio and online news.
The highly competitive local journalism contest drew more than 1,200 entries, said Emma Penrod, president of the Utah Headliners, the state’s professional chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. 
Entries featured work published in 2024, Utah News Dispatch’s first year reporting since launching Jan. 9, 2024. The Dispatch’s four-person team competed in the large newsroom division, squaring off with the largest and longest-running news outlets in the state.
The Utah News Dispatch voter guide won the contest’s inaugural “News you can use” category, with judges saying: “An interactive, stellar example of service journalism, this piece excels in delivering practical, timely information that empowers readers to engage in the democratic process.”
Reporter Kyle Dunphey won this year’s continuing coverage award for his dogged reporting on the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which since 1990 had compensated eligible residents in Western states who were made sick by radiation from U.S. weapons testing and development in the ’50s and ’60s but lapsed last summer when Congress failed to take action to continue it.
The judges said: “While a smaller media site, the Utah News Dispatch did an exemplary job of explaining why RECA is so important and how the legislation’s future could affect so many. It was consequential and well-executed, making politics in DC a meat-and-potatoes issue for so many Utahns. Well done!”
Senior Reporter Katie McKellar claimed two first-place wins. Her profile of innovative homeless service provider Switchpoint and its accountability-focused model won the Homelessness and Housing category, and she led the Longform Storytelling entries with her heartfelt report on a Utah man’s horseback ride across the country to spotlight the crisis facing wild mustangs.
McKellar was also recognized with an honorable mention in the prestigious Best News Reporter category.

Phil Scott signs new campaign finance rules, other election changes into law.","Deputy Secretary of State Lauren Hibbert looks on as the Senate debates an election reform bill at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Monday, June 16, 2025.

Gov. Phil Scott signed a package of changes to Vermont’s election procedures into law this week, among them an expansion of who has to file campaign finance disclosure forms and a restriction on candidates running in a general election who’ve lost a preceding primary election.
The changes are part of a bill, H.474, that nearly did not make it over the finish line this year. The House and Senate approved the bill on the final day of this year’s legislative session, June 16. Before that, though, the legislation appeared all but dead after Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, tied its political fate to an unrelated charter change proposal he was backing that sought to ban guns from bars in Burlington. 
With the charter change languishing in a key House committee, Baruth told the chair of a key Senate committee, which was reviewing the election bill, to pump the brakes — months after the election bill had already cleared the House. Two weeks later, though, following legislators’ partial recess in early June, Senate leaders brought the bill onto the floor for a vote — a decision one House leader credited, at least in part, to VTDigger’s reporting on the political dealing behind the scenes.
Senators cut a number of measures from the bill as it passed in the House, including a study of using ranked-choice voting in Vermont for future presidential primaries. The slimmed-down bill included all the “must-have” provisions identified by the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, a key backer of the legislation, according to Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, who chaired the Senate panel that reviewed the bill. 
Here are the key measures that did make it into the 30-page law, which also sets out a new reporting requirement for certain write-in candidates and updates rules on who must report on donations to campaigns, among a number of other changes.
Campaign finance disclosures
The law eliminates a measure currently on the books stating that only candidates who raise or spend $500 or more have to file campaign finance disclosure forms with the Secretary of State’s Office. Those forms allow the public to review how much candidates have raised and from whom, and how much they’ve spent and on what.
Now, anyone running for office will have to file a disclosure form — regardless of how much they raise or spend. If that amount is less than $500, they’ll have to formally attest to the state that they haven’t surpassed that ceiling. If they raise or spend more than that, the state’s existing rules requiring more detailed disclosure filings would kick in. 
Deputy Secretary of State Lauren Hibbert said her office regularly fields complaints from the public about candidates who, the complainants allege, have raised or spent more than $500 but haven’t disclosed any such information to the state. She said the office has little ability to track down potential scofflaws now, and hopes the new changes will create more accountability.
‘One bite’ candidacy
More controversial, though, was a portion of the law that now prevents a candidate who loses a primary election under the banner of one political party from running again in the general election under a different party label — or as an independent candidate.
The Secretary of State’s Office did not stake out a position for or against that change to restrict what’s often called “getting a second bite at the apple,” according to Hibbert. But while backers of the measure said it would make elections more fair, opponents said the changes were wrongly limiting the options voters could choose from on the ballot. 
On the House floor earlier this month, independent and Progressive members spoke against the change, and it drew the most debate, by far, of any section of the bill. The measure does not do away with so-called “fusion” candidates, however, which are those who get an endorsement from multiple parties on the general election ballot. 
Some senators were opposed to the “one bite” change, too. 
“I don’t think it harms anyone to allow this,” said Washington County Sen. Andrew Perchlik, who’s a Democrat/Progressive, during debate about the bill on that chamber’s floor earlier this month, before it was passed. For prospective independent candidates, specifically, “I think it’s an anti-democratic change,” he added. 
Write-in candidates
The new law also creates a requirement that write-in candidates for state and federal office in Vermont formally declare their candidacy with local or state officials. The change is designed to reduce the workload election officials have to take on, Hibbert said, especially when they’re tasked with tallying write-in votes that include what seem to be protest or joke votes for national figures or fictional characters. 
In other cases, ballots will come in with numerous different spellings of a candidate’s name, she said. Hilary Francis, the Brattleboro town clerk, told legislators earlier this year about a case where it wasn’t completely clear what member of a family local write-in votes were referring to. 
Under the new law, state and federal write-in candidates must tell either local clerks or the secretary of state about their intent to run by 5 p.m. on the Thursday before an election. When tallying up results, officials will then only count votes for candidates who met the deadline — with some exceptions, including for races in which a write-in candidate gets more votes than anyone whose name is listed on the ballot.
The goal is that officials will only have to count names of people who actually have a technical chance of getting elected to a given office, according to Hibbert. 
The bill also includes several smaller changes to how local clerks operate elections, including allowing for additional time to address issues with a person’s ballot, a process known as “curing.” 
‘Independent’ fundraisers
Another measure in the new law is meant to clarify that certain campaign finance rules apply to individuals who raise and spend money on behalf of a candidate, but who aren’t directly affiliated with that candidate. It wasn’t entirely clear in state law, according to Hibbert, that certain individual fundraisers had to follow as strict of filing guidelines as, for instance, larger political action committees, which are commonly called PACs.
Specifically, the law revises the definition of the term “independent expenditure-only political committee” to clarify that such a “committee” could include as little as one person.
Hibbert said the Secretary of State’s Office asked legislators to clarify the law after seeing Elon Musk, the billionaire and now-spurned adviser to President Donald Trump, hand out $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters in the leadup to an election for a seat on that state’s Supreme Court earlier this year. Musk was attempting to help elect a conservative judge to the court, though the candidate ultimately lost the race. 
The law also lowered, from $1,000 to $500, the threshold at which these “independent expenditure-only” committees will have to report their activities to the state. The same lowered threshold will also apply to political parties and PACs operating in the state.
Hibbert said she thinks that threshold is still high enough to avoid sweeping in people who advocate, on a very small scale, for and against issues in their communities, such as a school budget. But larger local efforts, she said, warrant greater transparency.
“The goals here were just more consistency across the board,” Hibbert said. 
Auditing voter rolls
Earlier this year, the House voted to affirm the victory of Rep. Jonathan Cooper, D-Pownal, in last fall’s contentious election in the Bennington-1 district, which includes the towns of Readsboro, Searsburg, Stamford, Woodford and a part of Pownal.
Roughly 50 people in the district received the wrong ballot in the election, and the race between Cooper and Republican Bruce Busa was decided by fewer than 30 votes, calling into question if the error influenced the result and how that should be handled.
In response to that election, legislators also added a measure into the election bill that requires local officials in places where House or Senate districts split municipal boundaries, such as in Bennington-1, to audit their voter rolls this year.
Local clerks will have to submit summaries of those audits to the Secretary of State’s Office by Nov. 15 — and the office itself must then develop a report on all those findings.
Open meeting law
Another measure in the legislation revises existing state law to “clarify,” according to Hibbert, that annual town meetings are not subject to the slate of requirements laid out in Vermont’s Open Meeting Law. While town meetings are open to all “legal voters” of a given place, Hibbert said, they aren’t — from a legal standpoint — open to the general public, which is where the distinction comes in. 
She said the clarification stemmed from some concern over towns having to provide remote access to town meeting proceedings, including remote voting options. She said that if people had concerns about public access to a town meeting, they could take them to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office or the state’s Human Rights Commission.

Free.,Democratic resolution to block military action in Iran fails to advance in US Senate,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-resolution-block-military-action-iran-fails-advance-us-senate,,"The U.S. Senate rejected Friday, 47-53, a resolution authored by Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine to block American forces from hostility against Iran.Though a shaky ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel has held this week, somewhat diminishing the urgency of the vote, proponents of the resolution made two major arguments during floor debate Friday: Congress should reassert its constitutional role as the only branch of government that can declare war and U.S. policy toward Iran should tilt more toward diplomacy.“We all agree that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon,” Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen said. “But bombing is not the best, most sustainable way of achieving that goal. And nothing, nothing I heard yesterday at the (classified) intelligence briefing changes that assessment. The bombing attack was also a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution, which reserves to the Congress the power to declare war.”The vote was nearly party-line, with Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman the only Democrat to vote against the measure and Rand Paul of Kentucky the only Republican in favor.Supporters argue for congressional roleU.S. forces dropped bombs on three Iranian nuclear enrichment sites June 21 amid that country’s war with Israel.President Donald Trump claimed an unqualified victory, though news reporting of intelligence assessments has shown the result was inconclusive and could have set Iran’s nuclear program back only a matter of months.Military and intelligence officers provided the classified briefing to members of Congress Thursday.Kaine, who has consistently called for presidents to win congressional authorization before taking offensive military action, said the framers of the Constitution deliberately gave the power to Congress.“War is too big an issue to leave in the hands of even a completely careful and deliberative individual,” Kaine said. “The framers didn't want to leave war in the hands of George Washington, for God's sake. They thought Congress should be involved.”Following the vote, Kaine said in a written statement he was upset with the senators who voted no.“I am disappointed that many of my colleagues are not willing to stand up and say Congress needs to be part of a decision as important as whether or not the U.S. should send our nation’s sons and daughters to fight against Iran,” he said.Paul, who has often clashed with his party on executive authority and other issues, made a constitutional argument and criticized the foreign policy that leads to active military engagement.“The American people are sick and tired of sending their children to fight and die in war zones on the other side of the world with no tangible U.S. interest at stake,” he said. “Abdicating our constitutional responsibility by allowing the executive branch to unilaterally introduce U.S. troops into wars is an affront to the Constitution and to the American people.”535 commanders in chiefOpponents of the resolution argued it would needlessly tie the president’s hands in matters of war.The process required of going through Congress to approve military action would be too long to be practical, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham said.“Just think (of) the chaos that would ensue in this country if there were not one commander-in-chief, but 535, and we had to sit down and talk among ourselves and debate as to whether or not we should go forward with the military operation in question,” he said. “That would paralyze this country.”Tennessee Republican Bill Hagerty said the operation was a success and the decision to order it was entirely within Trump’s constitutional power as commander-in-chief. Iran had been hostile to the U.S. and its ally Israel for decades, he said.“President Trump's actions last weekend did not start a war,” Haggerty said. “His actions ended a war, and not a single American life was lost. We should not be here debating how to constrain effective residential leadership, but rather discussing how to recognize effective leadership and supporting it.”Constraining a president’s power undermines the ability to use the element of surprise that is crucial to modern warfare, Hagerty added.The resolution “elevates process over common sense, policy and political optics over operational necessity,” he said.",,,,2025-06-27 20:02:04.565167

Montana’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen was cited this week in Belgrade for driving under the influence of alcohol.
Hedalen, serving in her first term as head of the Office of Public Instruction, has not yet appeared in Belgrade Municipal Court to enter a plea.
Lee Enterprises first reported the citation, a misdemeanor.
In a statement Friday, Hedalen, a Republican, apologized for her poor judgment.
“I apologize and take full responsibility for my lapse in judgement that led to this incident,” Hedalen said in a statement emailed from her chief of staff.
“I want to thank the Belgrade Police for their professionalism and commitment to public safety. As I move forward from this personal issue, it will in no way impact my service to the people of Montana.”
Hedalen was released from the Gallatin County Detention Center on an $885 bond on June 22, the same day she received the citation, according to the court.
A patrol officer outlined the incident that led to her arrest in an affidavit of probable cause.
Late Saturday night, Hedalen was traveling 50 mph in a 35 mph zone, “almost cut off several vehicles” in a turn, and was “slow to react” to the officer’s emergency lights, said the court record.
She had “a dazed expression,” “very slow movements,” and bloodshot eyes, the affidavit said.
“I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle,” the officer said.
Hedalen told the officer she had had “one glass of wine,” said the court record. The affidavit said Hedalen failed both a field sobriety test and a preliminary breath sample.
The legal blood alcohol content limit in Montana is 0.08 percent.
Hedalen subsequently declined to provide an Intoxilyzer breath sample and was transported to the hospital for a blood sample, according to the court record.
Results of the blood test are not yet available, according to the Belgrade Police Department.
However, the Belgrade City Attorney’s Office said results of the test would be considered part of “confidential criminal justice information” until the case concludes.
Hedalen must make an initial appearance in court within 10 days, on or before July 8, according to municipal court.
Former Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen previously pleaded guilty to a traffic violation for “following too closely,” a 2023 incident she described as a “bump with the bumper,” and no contest for illegally passing a school bus in 2022.
Arntzen led OPI for two terms, the last eight years. Hedalen won the office in November 2024 and took her oath in January 2025.
Court records in Hedalen’s case said she had no prior convictions for driving under the influence.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A group of Republican lawmakers, who have opposed carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa, penned a letter to U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill. 
“Repeal 45Q now!” the letter read, naming the section of tax code. 
The budget reconciliation bill, known as the “one big beautiful bill,” has removed or substantially altered a number of clean energy credits for things like wind power or solar projects, but it has retained the 45Q tax credit, which was initiated in 2008 and expanded under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. 
The Senate has not finalized its version of the bill yet, but is aiming for a Fourth of July deadline.

Iowa lawmakers from both the House and the Senate have been opposed to 45Q credits and to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which plans to lay nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline in Iowa alone to transport carbon dioxide captured at ethanol facilities to underground storage in North Dakota. 
Six GOP lawmakers from North Dakota also signed on the letter. A similar letter that circulated earlier this month was headed by lawmakers in South Dakota. 
The opponents in the Iowa-led letter said the federal tax credit “bankrolls private corporations” to “bulldoze our land, intimidate our communities, endanger lives, and bury opportunity.” 
Carbon sequestration pipelines have brought about arguments surrounding private property rights. Summit was granted the right of eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission last year. The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate. 
The bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds June 11, and House lawmakers have submitted a petition to return for a special session to override the veto, but the effort will likely not be picked up by the Senate. 
“For four years, we have fought a grueling legislative battle to defend the constitutional property rights, safety, and economic vitality of our constituents—80–90% of whom reject the 45Q,” the letter read, referencing a survey from the fall conducted by a group opposed to the pipeline. 
In addition to opposing the use of eminent domain, opponents of the CO2 pipeline worry about potential safety issues associated with the project and damage to cropland. 
“Why would we bulldoze our way through some of the best farmland in the world to bury CO2 into formations with unknown consequences and deprive the Corn Belt of adding value and purpose to one third of each bushel of corn in the form of methanol and other fuels?” the letter read. 
Summit has said it will restore cropland impacted by the pipeline to its original condition and holds that it is “going above and beyond” federal standards to ensure safety. 
According to its website, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would have the capacity to put more than 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually into storage. 45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually. 
The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter. 
“This is no state issue —it’s a federal travesty, with 45Q’s unlimited borrowed billions fueling corporate aggression,” the letter read. 
A 2023 report on the tax credit from the Congressional Budget Office estimated by the 2030s the expanded use of carbon sequestration and companies claiming the credits could result in federal revenue loss between $30 billion and “well over” $100 billion. 
The letter from lawmakers said the cost was “staggering.” 
Carbon capture and sequestration would allow the Iowa biofuels industry to enter the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which it says would be hugely beneficial to struggling farmers and the state.
The CBO report also projected that if all of the projected carbon capture and sequestration projects across the country were brought online, it could remove close to 3% of the nation’s annual CO2 emissions.
The letter argues if the industry attempts to reach “net zero” emissions, the cost of these tax credits to the federal government, and taxpayers, would be even higher. 
“Repealing 45Q in (the budget reconciliation bill) would halt this federally funded nightmare, save trillions of additional debt, and empower our farmers and ethanol plants to lead a new renewable fuels revolution,” the letter said. “Our constituents demand it, our farmland deserves it, and our future depends on it.”
Ernst’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.
A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.

Dan Newhouse (R-WA), seen during a July 2019 hearing on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C., was reelected in the 2024 election to a sixth term in the U.S. House.Washington U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse says he won’t back the sweeping tax cut and spending bill his fellow Republicans are trying to push through Congress if it includes controversial provisions to sell off federal public land.
Newhouse and four other Republicans in the U.S. House stated their opposition to the potential land sales in a Thursday letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson.
“If a provision to sell public lands is in the bill that reaches the House floor, we will be forced to vote no,” says the letter, which was also signed by Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Oregon, and Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif.
Republicans hold a narrow 220-212 majority in the House, and their “One Big Beautiful Bill” squeaked through that chamber by just a single vote in May.
Before it did, Republicans scrapped a proposal to make 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah available for sale.
The sweeping budget legislation is now under consideration in the Senate, where Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced a scaled-up version of the land sale proposal earlier this month. It would’ve made millions of acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management property in Washington and other states eligible for sale.
Earlier this week, the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled the language of Lee’s original proposition was out of order. However, Lee has said he wants to press ahead with a narrower version of the plan that would still put thousands of acres of Bureau of Land Management property up for sale in 11 Western states, including Washington. 
Newhouse and the four other Republicans said in their letter to Johnson that they “generally accept changes to the bill that may be made by the Senate.” But they added: “We cannot accept the sale of federal lands that Senator Lee seeks.”
They said efforts by Lee to add a land sale proposal into the bill “would be a grave mistake, unforced error, and poison pill that will cause the bill to fail should it come to the House floor.”
A spokesman for Newhouse’s office said Friday the congressman did not have any comment on the issue beyond what was said in the letter.

With the devastating Los Angeles blazes still fresh in memory, cities across the Bay Area region are developing plans to lower the climate-heating emissions that are fanning the flames.
But a dangerous new bill now threatens this progress. AB 306, while purporting to address the fallout from this year’s fires, could actually increase the risk of future fires and pause local progress to address other climate disasters.
This week the provisions of AB 306 were put on the fast track for approval as state leaders shifted the contents of the bill into a budget trailer bill — a process that will make it eligible for approval by midnight Monday. 
While some narrow exceptions were added, the measure would still ban most local governments from adopting stronger building codes that promote energy efficiency until 2031. This severely limits improvements for six years — even as climate disasters intensify and technology advances — and circumvents local control and the normal legislative process in the state Senate.
We know firsthand how much of a mistake this would be. In San Jose and Palo Alto, we proved that smart building codes are one of our state’s best tools for increasing climate resilience, cutting pollution, lowering energy bills and protecting public health.
In 2019 the San Jose and Palo Alto city councils approved codes that cut development costs by going all-in on electrification, while cutting back on expensive and often unnecessary gas hookups. This — combined with additional incentives for solar panels and electric vehicle chargers in San Jose and for home appliances in Palo Alto — is creating cleaner air and reducing emissions, all without breaking the bank. 
Thousands of Palo Alto and San Jose residents now enjoy lower energy costs and healthier air quality, thanks to their all-electric homes.
Across the state, cities have followed the lead of San Jose and Palo Alto, by crafting building codes that are tailored to each community’s needs. Local challenges, such as sea level rise, housing shortages, or wildfire risks are often best addressed with locally-crafted solutions.
The proposed measure in the budget trailer bill puts this progress at risk. 
Proponents claim it will help fire victims rebuild affordably. The evidence says otherwise. Multiple studies have confirmed that there is “no clear correlation between energy code updates and rising housing prices.”
If anything, pausing code updates would worsen California’s affordability crisis. New energy standards have saved Californians more than $100 billion in utility costs over the past 50 years, and the next update is expected to save another $4.8 billion. 
Cities we represent and others across California deserve to benefit from these proven savings, but now they risk getting stuck with outdated, energy-wasting appliances. 
Energy-efficient homes aren’t just cheaper to live in — they are also cheaper to build. As we saw from our successes in our cities, building with efficient electric appliances can save up to $10,000 per unit by eliminating the need for gas line infrastructure.
The building code pause would also pause this commonsense progress, taking control away from local cities without making housing any more affordable.
Here’s the cruel irony:  this “wildfire recovery” option could make future fires worse. By blocking local clean energy policies that reduce climate-warming pollution and stripping communities of the flexibility to update codes based on advances in technology, the proposed change leaves us more vulnerable to the next disaster. 
Lawmakers should be empowering communities to be agile in response to new technologies and to explore localized solutions that promote efficiency and affordability. Cutting pollution and facilitating housing construction can co-exist.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_39.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 19:03:32.698157

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Immigrant advocates said Friday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling on birthright citizenship is creating alarm for an already fearful immigrant community.
“It’s going to be more chaotic than it is right now, for sure,” said Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Bergen). “Every time I think, ‘Oh, this is the worst it’s going to be,’ it just gets even worse. And I think people really need to wake up to what’s happening right under their nose.” 
The high court’s 6-3 decision is a major win for President Donald Trump and his push to detain and deport millions of immigrants. The decision reins in nationwide injunctions from lower courts that had blocked Trump’s order restricting birthright citizenship, saying universal injunctions likely exceed federal courts’ authority. The court declined to rule on the constitutionality of Trump’s order, which would deny citizenship to babies born to people in the United States on short-term visas or without legal status.
The cases now return to the lower courts that had issued those injunctions, with instructions to ensure that their new orders comport with the high court’s ruling. Twenty-two states, including New Jersey, challenged Trump’s birthright citizenship order.
Officials in New Jersey, where roughly 1 in 4 residents are immigrants, rebuked the Supreme Court decision.
Democratic members of the Legislative Latino Caucus said it “opened the door for a harmful policy that threatens a basic promise” of birthright citizenship. Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Democrat, said people “have a right to be concerned,” but added he is confident attorneys general across the nation will successfully challenge Trump’s order.
“Birthright citizenship is part of the fabric of this nation. We’re going to win on that,” Platkin told reporters Friday. “The Supreme Court very clearly did not say otherwise today, and ultimately, when this is resolved, their rights will be vindicated.” 
In a statement, Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said he has “no doubt that the Trump Administration will see today’s decision as an invitation to continue disregarding the Constitution,” but believes the lower courts will conclude Trump’s order is “blatantly illegal.”
Friday’s ruling left room for relief through the filing of class action lawsuits, and at least two have been filed by immigrant rights groups since the decision was released.
Steven Sacco, an attorney with immigrant rights group American Friends Service Committee, said that until the fight over birthright citizenship is resolved, “it’ll be chaos, and just a great deal of terror and disruption to everyone’s lives.”
“It puts us all in danger,” he added. “It seems the Trump administration is so eager to deport people that the deportation law is the hole through which democracy is draining out of the United States.”










Every time I think, ‘Oh, this is the worst it’s going to be,’ it just gets even worse.


– Assemblywoman Ellen Park


Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, compared Friday’s decision to the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal right to an abortion, known as Dobbs. 
“It caused so much confusion, people were willing to uproot and displace themselves to be able to find sanctuary in those states that had affirmatively passed protections, and New Jersey was quick to act in enshrining some of those protections in our laws,” she said.
Torres added that Friday’s ruling similarly “ripped away” a right that people saw as a fully cemented civil liberty — but the reaction from New Jersey lawmakers has been different.
“I think we’re not seeing the same swiftness toward providing privacy protections for immigrants in the same way,” she said.
While New Jersey can’t outright provide birthright citizenship, she said, lawmakers can pass the Immigrant Trust Act to enshrine protections for people who could be targets of federal immigration authorities. That bill, sponsored by Park, would codify a 2018 state directive barring local law enforcement from assisting in civil immigration enforcement. It would also prohibit officials in public places like hospitals, schools, and libraries from collecting information on residents’ immigration status.
The bill was introduced in October but has yet to receive a legislative hearing, a key step toward passage. Top lawmakers have suggested it would leave the state open to new lawsuits.
Without the bill, Torres noted, hospitals and health care centers can collect immigration status and potentially disclose it to federal agents, particularly if there is no guidance from the state. 
Sacco said the bill would “protect citizens under this regime just as it does non-citizens.”
“The Immigrant Trust Act will prevent state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE in a way that will protect, in this case, citizens from deportation,” he said.

Park, who is an immigrant from South Korea, said she’s “flabbergasted” by Friday’s ruling but has hopes birthright citizenship as it has been defined for 157 years will remain.
She agreed the Immigrant Trust Act would offer more protections for New Jersey families and called for its passage. But she noted the federal government is creating its own rule book — like going after students writing critical opinion pieces in college newspapers and undocumented people without criminal records who have been here for decades.
“Are they then going to take it up a notch? Basically not just wait outside — but maybe even enter homes and enter churches and other places?” she said. “This is going to get crazy.”

Ten years and one day after that ruling, the Flippins, born and raised Denverites, got married at the Denver Elections Division after being together for 14 years. 
“We’ve considered each other wives for quite a long time, so it seemed like an appropriate time to actually sign that certificate,” Melissa said.

The Denver Clerk and Recorder’s office held its first ever Pride Marriage Marathon Friday, allowing couples to get a marriage license and have a ceremony officiated on the same day to kick off Denver Pride weekend. Couples picked up their marriage licenses at Wellington E. Webb Municipal Building and walked over to the elections division office for their ceremonies.
The clerk’s office has consistently held a Marriage Marathon on Valentine’s Day, and Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López said his office was overdue to host a Pride rendition. 
“It’s a celebration, and for me, I take it seriously as much as it’s a celebration, because I know what’s at stake,” López said. “I know what’s at stake in the environment that we’re facing right now, and in a little bit of uncertainty, it’s that much more of a powerful thing to do.”

López said his office initially planned a Pride Marriage Marathon in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic stopped it from starting that summer. He said the day was filled with tears, joy, excitement and giddiness. 
“I feel joyful. It’s an honor to do this, especially for folks in our community,” López said. “We want to honor folks, especially today, honor love, and remind mind folks that love is love. I think there’s probably no other words more powerful than that.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Republican leaders in Congress have rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government and have targeted access to gender-affirming care for transgender people. The Supreme Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority, and concern that the court could reverse the Obergefell decision has grown since it overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion.
Colorado voters in November approved an amendment to remove language — though it was inoperable because of the Obergefell decision — from the Colorado Constitution that banned same-sex marriage. The Colorado Legislature passed a law this year that would remove similar language from state statute.

López got to officiate the wedding for a relative of a friend he went to school with. That was for Sade Kiel and Emily Panyachitch, who had their ceremony under a rainbow balloon arch in the center of the Elections Division. The room went silent as over a dozen of their family members gathered to watch them share wedding vows. 
“We are very fortunate, because a lot of people don’t have this amount of support,” Kiel said about their family. “So I can’t explain in words how I feel. It’s just a beautiful thing. I’m just so happy. I’m ecstatic. I’m just blessed, to be honest.”

Kiel said she was overwhelmed with “all the good emotions that you should have at the end of a wedding ceremony.” The couple, who have been together 12 years, took four days to plan a small reception to celebrate their marriage. 
“We’ve been talking about having a wedding for so very long, but of course, the important thing for us was buying a home,” Kiel said. “So we purchased our first home versus having a wedding, and so seeing this opportunity arise … I was like, would you like to do this? And she was like let’s do it.” 
Panyachitch said she looks forward to celebrating Pride in Denver with Kiel as newlyweds this year. 
“Say it out loud. Don’t be afraid to come out. Don’t be afraid to be yourself,” Panyachitch said. “There will always be an entourage out there for you who is cheering for you.”

James Murphy and Alex Albarenga got engaged in August 2024 and were planning a larger wedding, but they managed to plan a reception for about 50 people to celebrate their marriage after deciding to go to the Pride Marriage Marathon two weeks ago.
“We are ready to get married today. We’ve been together for three and a half years, and we just felt like this is a really good time, especially with things going on today in the world,” Murphy said. “We just want to make sure we can seal our deal and make sure we have our special moment, before it could be ripped away from us.” 
The couple was surrounded by friends during their ceremony, one of whom video called another friend to watch Murphy and Albarenga exchange vows. They planned to celebrate at a rooftop terrace and bar with live music, and will close out their wedding day with a party bus.

Murphy said it “means the world” that he got to marry his best friend the day after the 10-year anniversary of the Obergefell decision and on the first day of Denver Pride weekend.
Cat Pace and Wynona Redman moved to Colorado from Texas a month ago and decided to kick off their time in their new home with a wedding. 
“That kind of sealed the whole deal,” Redman said. Pace added, “House, car, puppies, our daughters are here, our grandbabies are here, it’s exciting.”

Pace said a friend sent her the link about the Pride Marriage Marathon, and the couple thought “why the heck not?” In 2020, Redman’s daughters threw a surprise commitment ceremony for the couple in Denver, so signing their marriage licence in the city felt “full circle.” 
While Pace joked that Colorado is colder than Texas, Redman said “it just feels more like home here.” 
“This is my first pride, to be honest.  I’ve always had to kind of keep it quiet,” Pace said. “So this is pretty cool, just to be able to soak it all in, to see all the friendliness, the cultural support. It’s fantastic.”

Attorneys for Kappa Kappa Gamma are asking for a final ruling to put a two-plus-year legal battle to rest. 
The post Wyoming sorority asks court to dismiss lawsuit over transgender inclusion, again appeared first on WyoFile .","Attorneys for Kappa Kappa Gamma are asking a federal court to end the long-running legal battle over the University of Wyoming sorority’s inclusion of a transgender member. 
“Much has changed in the more than two years since this case was initially filed,” the plaintiffs wrote in a motion to dismiss filed Friday. 
Six members sued the sorority in early 2023 for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Artemis Langford, a transgender woman, by a vote of its members.
U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson dismissed the case in August 2023, ruling that the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members. Months later, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver also dismissed the case. 
That left the sorority sisters — Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar — two choices. They could amend the complaint or ask the lower court for a final judgement. 
Almost a year later, facing a filing deadline, they filed an amended complaint earlier this month that no longer named Langford as a defendant and included a new set of plaintiffs. 
“The matter has bounced between this court and the Tenth Circuit,” Friday’s filing states. “Four of the six named plaintiffs have left the case and a new one has joined. Each of the current and former plaintiffs and the former student defendant who attended the University of Wyoming have graduated.”
And yet, attorneys for the sorority argue, “this remains a case where plaintiffs seek to have a federal court dictate to a private organization how inclusive it can be in defining its own membership.” (Emphasis from the filing.)
In Johnson’s 2023 dismissal of the case, he applied the landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale. 
In 2000, the high court ruled that the scouting organization was exempt from New Jersey state law that bars anti-gay discrimination. The private organization had fired James Dale, an assistant scout master, when it found out he was gay. Overturning a lower court’s decision, the Supreme Court ruled that requiring the Boy Scouts to readmit Dale would violate the private organization’s First Amendment right of expressive association.
“Dale controls today, interestingly with the shoe on the other foot,” Johnson wrote. “Whether excluding gay scoutmasters in Dale or including transgender women in Kappa, this Judge may not invade Kappa’s sacrosanct, associational right to engage in protected speech.”
Attorneys for the sorority pointed back to this in their Friday filings. 
“As was the case when defendants moved to dismiss this case two years ago, plaintiffs have no legal right to have their sorority’s leadership adopt their personal definition of who is and is not a ‘woman,’” the filing states. “And it is not the role of the courts to police the membership decisions of private organizations.” 
The legal defects of the amended complaint extend beyond that, the defendants also argue, pointing to a failure of the plaintiffs to properly identify wrongdoing. Kappa’s attorneys also allege that the sorority sisters failed to serve or attempt to serve all defendants. 
Johnson’s 2023 dismissal was “without prejudice,” meaning it was not a final decision, and effectively left the sorority sisters the option to amend their complaint. 
Kappa’s attorneys are asking the court for a final ruling. 
“Defendants respectfully submit that the time has come for the court to put an end to plaintiffs’ attempts to use this court to advance their preferred social agenda within a private organization of more than 210,000 members,” the filing states. 
The plaintiffs will now have an opportunity to respond before the court makes a decision. 
Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced earlier this month it’s investigating the University of Wyoming for alleged Title IX violations stemming from the sorority’s inclusion of a transgender member.

(Phot courtesy of U.S. Forest Service) Residents of Pine Valley, where the Forsyth Fire swept through last week destroying homes, were able to return to their community on Friday — but the 10,000-plus acre fire continues to burn, and officials say locals should be prepared to evacuate again. 
Meanwhile, fire danger continues to rise across Utah, prompting statewide restrictions and a call from Gov. Spencer Cox to pray for rain. 
This summer is off to a fiery start, with 380 blazes across the state, 275 of them human-caused. The majority of Utah is currently in either severe or moderate drought and an estimated 43,000 acres have burned. 
That includes the 10,600 acres burned by the Forsyth Fire, which as of Friday has destroyed at least 14 structures, most of them homes, in the small Pine Valley community located north of St. George. Although residents were allowed to return home on Friday, the community remains in a “Set” level evacuation order, meaning they should prepare to evacuate again if the situation worsens.

Crews have made progress fighting the lightning-caused fire, which is now about 8% contained. But officials with the U.S. Forest Service say rising temperatures and strong winds continue to pose a threat to the area. 
To that end, the governor, as he has done in past years, called for a day of prayer and fasting for rain on Sunday, June 29. 
“Utah is facing a tough season, and we need both divine help and practical action,” Cox said in a statement on Friday. “I invite every Utahn, whatever your faith or belief system, to join me this Sunday in a unified fast and prayer for rain. And while we look heavenward, let’s do our part here at home — fix leaks, water lawns less and use every drop wisely. Small actions, taken together, can make a big difference for our state.”
The largest fire in the state is the France Canyon Fire, burning in Dixie National Forest outside of Bryce Canyon National Park. As of Friday, the fire was at 32,053 acres and about 15% containment. 
Officials also announced statewide fire restrictions on both state and federal land — that means no fires in spaces outside of approved campgrounds or homesites with running water; no fireworks, shooting exploding targets or metalwork; no operating machinery or equipment (including motorcycles, chainsaws, ATVs, or other small internal combustion engines) without a spark arrestor; and no smoking near vegetation. 
Those restrictions apply to the following regions: 

All state owned land (including state parks, trust lands and wildlife management areas)
All unincorporated private land 
Six Bureau of Land Management districts — the Arizona Strip, Color Country, Canyon Country, Green River, Paria River and West Desert districts
Three U.S. Forest Service regions — Dixie, Fishlake and Manti-La Sal national forests
Eight national parks, monuments and recreation areas — Arches, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands national parks; Cedar Breaks, Hovenweep and Natural Bridges national monuments; and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area 

“Our forests and rangelands at all elevations are drying out quickly, making it easier for wildfires to ignite and spread — especially on windy days,” said Brett Ostler, the state fire management officer with the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands.

In strongly worded dissenting opinions, two of the Iowa justices called the majority’s decision in the case on Friday “frightening” and “profoundly wrong,” warning that it could remove any disincentive for state officials to willfully hold prisoners well beyond their scheduled release dates.
Justice David May, joined by Chief Justice Susan Christensen and Justices Thomas Waterman and Edward Mansfield, upheld a district court judge’s decision to dismiss Eugene Sikora’s claim for damages for being held in prison past his proper release date.
Justice Christopher McDonald, joined by Justices Dana Oxley and Matthew McDermott, filed a dissenting opinion. In addition, Oxley filed a dissenting opinion of her own, in which she was joined by McDonald and McDermott, and McDermott authored a dissenting opinion of his own, in which he was joined by McDonald and Oxley.
In his lawsuit, Sikora had claimed the state had released him from prison five months late due to a mathematical miscalculation. Three years after he was released, Sikora sued the state and the director of the Iowa Department of Corrections for wrongful imprisonment, seeking monetary damages.
A district court judge dismissed the lawsuit, citing the doctrine of sovereign immunity in which the state and its employees are generally considered immune from state-law tort claims for monetary damages arising from wrongful imprisonment.
In upholding that district court decision, Justice May, writing for the majority, stated that no exceptions to the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied to the case and concluded Sikora’s suit could not proceed.
“The district court properly rejected Sikora’s state law claims for money damages,” May wrote. “But this does not mean that our courts are unable to help persons who are wrongfully detained in Iowa prisons. If Sikora had asked our courts for non-monetary relief — like an order to release him from prison — sovereign immunity would not have foreclosed his request.”
May noted there are “pathways for wrongfully convicted prisoners to obtain money damages in state court. One element of Iowa law, he noted, waives sovereign immunity to permit money damages claims by people who are imprisoned because of wrongful convictions – but that law doesn’t apply to Sikora’s case, May wrote, because he pleaded guilty to his crimes.
McDonald says majority is ‘profoundly wrong’

In his dissenting opinion, Justice McDonald noted that America’s foundational principles and common law enabled people injured by government officials to sue those same government officials for monetary damages and other relief.
“This common law regime of rights was codified as fundamental law in the structure and text of the federal and state constitutions, including the Iowa Constitution,” McDonald wrote. “The state now claims that its officials can violate this fundamental law and imprison people with impunity … Not even King George III asserted such power for his officials, and our forefathers attempted to make sure none could assert it here. They understood that tyranny authorized by statute is still tyranny.”
McDonald wrote that the law extending the state’s immunity in cases such as Sikora’s “is illegal and void because the extension of sovereign immunity to these government officials contravenes the structure and text of the state constitution.”
McDonald also characterized the majority’s decision as “profoundly wrong” and an example of “willful ignorance” with regard to its refusal to acknowledge past court decisions. The “special status” the majority conferred upon state officials, McDonald wrote, “does not make sense. What logical distinction would provide state officials immunity superior to federal and local officials?”
Even if the state had “some legitimate interest in limiting the liability of its employees” for their conduct, McDonald added, “its chosen means in this case — the total elimination of any right of recovery for wrongfully imprisoned people — is unduly oppressive and thus constitutionally forbidden.”
McDonald said the state’s claim of sovereign immunity was “nothing more than an assertion that the government and its officials have the unilateral right to alter the state constitution through normal legislation and wrongly imprison people without being held to account. That assertion is odious and repugnant to republican constitutional order.”

Noting that the Iowa state flag says, “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain,” McDonald opined that the court’s majority was rejecting “the very core of liberty at the heart of our state constitutional order” by asserting that wrongful imprisonment at the hands of state officials is lawful. “It should not be celebrated here,” he wrote. “It is absolutism, pure, simple, and naked.”
In his separate dissenting opinion, Justice McDermott called the majority’s decision “both frightening and, as a legal matter, wrong.”
McDermott said “the evidence is overwhelming that during Iowa’s founding era, people could pursue lawsuits for money damages against government officials in both Iowa and federal courts. The majority’s claim to the contrary — that sovereign immunity protects state officials from private causes of action — is fundamentally incompatible with the historical evidence.”
McDermott added that the majority’s dismissal of Sikora’s claim left Sikora “without a remedy despite his having allegedly suffered five months of unlawful confinement. And after today, it is hard to see what disincentive any state prison official would have to unlawfully hold an inmate well beyond his release date.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Iowa-Supreme-Court.jpg,,,2025-06-27 19:03:32.698157

The communications union district has sought to switch over its operations to a new nonprofit while fighting a fierce legal battle against GWI, its current Maine-based operator.

As ECFiber and the company that currently runs its operations continue to spar in court, the communication union district announced that its new service provider has hired its first chief executive officer.  
Gopi Sundaram, a longtime investor in broadband projects, is taking the helm of the Vermont ISP Operating company, or VISPO, a nonprofit created by members of ECFiber’s board. The organization plans to take over ECFiber’s operations next year.
Sundaram currently serves as a managing partner at Radius Capital Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in telecommunications investments. Previously, he was the managing director of the Tetrad McCourt consortium, an investment group that helped oversee the deployment of Ireland’s National Broadband Plan. 
“We were very happy to have Gopi join the VISPO board initially, and thrilled when he told us he’d be willing to become our CEO,” said VISPO board chair Alessandro Iuppa in a Thursday press release. “His expertise and deep experience gives VISPO the requisite leadership to manage and operate ECFiber.”

ECFiber is Vermont’s oldest communications union district — a type of municipal entity created by lawmakers in 2015 to support the rollout of high speed internet access in underserved parts of the state. (Founded in 2008 as an alliance of towns, ECFiber preceded, and served as a model for, other communications union districts in the state.) The district serves slightly fewer than 10,000 customers across 31 Vermont member towns and owns roughly 1,750 miles of fiber optic cable lines, according to its 2024 annual report. 
Members of ECFiber’s governing board moved to take on VISPO as its new service provider in April as a simmering legal spat between the district and its current operating company, the Maine-based Biddeford Internet Corp (also known as Great Works Internet, or GWI) began to reach a boiling point. 
GWI first took over operations for ECFiber in 2022, after a sequence of scandals led the district’s previous service provider ValleyNet, a nonprofit, to step back and ultimately dissolve in April, according to a business filing with the Vermont Secretary of State. 
GWI also runs operations for two more of Vermont’s nine communications union districts — DVFiber and Northwest Fiberworx.
But in February, ECFiber accused GWI of starting to reorganize its operations in a way that would detract from the service provided to the district. GWI has meanwhile argued that VISPO was created on false pretenses, and that the communications district has violated their contract in attempting to abruptly transition between service providers.
In March, GWI launched a lawsuit against ECFiber’s governing board chair F.X. Flinn, claiming that the creation of VISPO was a maneuver orchestrated by Flinn “to literally poach GWI’s business and its opportunity with ECFiber for himself.”

Flinn, who was initially a founding director of the nonprofit operating company but has since stepped down, has strenuously denied the claims, arguing in court filings and in interviews that the lawsuit is a “SLAPP suit,” or a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, designed to intimidate ECFiber and complicate its transition to VISPO.  
And in a flurry of legal filings made in recent months, the case has begun to escalate as GWI and ECFiber have accused one another of breaching their agreement. 
In an amended complaint filed in mid-May, GWI broadened the scope of its initial lawsuit against Flinn by naming ECFiber itself as a codefendant. It also accused the communication union district of violating its contract, among other allegations. 
ECFiber, meanwhile, has countersued, alleging that GWI has refused to cooperate as the district has attempted to begin shifting its operations to VISPO. 
In May, ECFiber introduced a “transition policy” under which GWI would allow VISPO to gradually learn and take on all operating capabilities, from billing and bookkeeping to marketing and network management. Claiming that GWI has thus far refused to comply with the policy, ECFiber last week asked the court for a preliminary injunction requiring the company to cooperate, saying that the district would otherwise suffer “irreparable harm.”
In a written statement to VTDigger, however, GWI CEO Karem Durdag said that the contract between the two entities “does not allow ECFiber to unilaterally impose such obligations” on GWI and that the company would say as much in court.
“ECFiber is attempting to force GWI to train, equip, and effectively subsidize a start-up competitor, without our consent, without compensation, and on an unrealistic timeline,” Durdag said. “That demand is not only unjust and unprecedented, it is deeply irresponsible. It would require pulling skilled GWI employees from other Vermont CUDs and would compromise the very viability of our operations.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)The permitting and approval process to build new homes and apartment units in Idaho is too time consuming, which contributes to a lack of affordable housing, a legislative committee studying housing issues in the Gem State heard Friday. 
New Idaho legislative committee aims to identify barriers – and solutions – to housing issues

The delays affect the availability of housing and ultimately add to the housing costs the eventual owners or renters will pay, homebuilders and other speakers told the Idaho Legislature’s Land Use and Housing Study Committee.
The committee, which includes state legislators, building officials, architects, planners and city and county elected officials, is studying the barriers and solutions to Idaho’s affordable housing challenges. Friday was its second meeting, which was held at the College of Eastern Idaho in Idaho Falls.
During Friday’s meeting, Valley County Commissioner Sherry Maupin said the so-called “not in my backyard,” or “NIMBY” opposition to housing and development also adds to the state’s inability to build more homes. 
“This has been going on since the ‘60s, and that is why that there has been a decrease in building. (It’s) because people are coming in in droves and saying, ‘not in my backyard,’” Maupin said. “So that is driving a lot more litigation. We’ve had an increase in litigation in Valley County, where there’s a lot of appeals that we’ve never had appeals of before. So it is slowing down the process.”

Sen. Ali Rabe, D-Boise, pushed for the formation of an interim committee to study housing barriers and solutions during the recent 2025 legislative session. Rabe modeled Idaho’s committee after a Montana committee, and she hopes it will come up with bipartisan solutions for housing availability and affordability.
The committee will be able to make recommendations to the Idaho Legislature during the 2026 legislative session. 
The Idaho Legislature’s Land Use and Housing Study Committee has two other meetings scheduled. The interim committee plans to meet Aug. 14 in Sandpoint and Sept. 26 in Boise. 
Friday’s meeting was streamed live online through the Idaho in Session service, which is a partnership between Idaho Public Television, the Idaho Legislature and the Idaho Legislative Services Office.

(Getty Images)Parties on both sides of a federal lawsuit over Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender youth must file supplemental briefs in light of last week’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Tennessee’s similar ban, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Friday.
A federal judge blocked Arkansas’ Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act of 2021 before it could go into effect, in response to a lawsuit filed by four families of transgender minors represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas. The judge permanently enjoined the law on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds in June 2023, and the state appealed the ruling.

U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors


The appeals court heard oral arguments in the case last year and has yet to issue a ruling. On Friday, the court ordered the plaintiffs and defendants to file briefs “addressing only the equal protection claim in light of United States v. Skrmetti,” the Tennessee case.
The SAFE Act “prohibits medical care on the basis of sex,” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, U.S. District Judge James Moody wrote in his June 2023 ruling. The law prohibited physicians from providing “gender transition” treatments like hormones, puberty blockers and surgeries to those under age 18.
Tennessee’s similar law was blocked in federal district court but overturned by an appeals court and upheld 6-3 by the U.S. Supreme Court, a decision that did not lift the injunction on Arkansas’ law. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Tennessee’s law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.
Roberts wrote that the court would leave policy decisions about transgender health care up to “the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.” State officials in both Tennessee and Arkansas have claimed transgender health care for minors is rooted in activism and experimentation rather than evidence-based science.
However, “the State’s experts offered no evidence-based treatment alternatives” to prescribing hormones and puberty blockers for transgender youth, Moody wrote in his ruling. Without evidence to support the state’s claims, the law also violated the right to due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the parents of transgender children, he wrote.

The appeals court gave the parties in the lawsuit until July 11 to file their briefs.
Three of the four transgender minor plaintiffs — Dylan Brandt of Greenwood, Sabrina Jennen of Fayetteville and Parker Saxton of Vilonia — are now at least 18 years old. The fourth, Brooke Dennis of Bentonville, is 13 years old.
One parent of each child shared their experiences with their children’s gender transitions during the case’s eight-day trial in 2022, the nation’s first trial over a law like the SAFE Act. Brandt, then 17, was the only minor to take the witness stand.
The other two plaintiffs were Dr. Michele Hutchison and Dr. Kathryn Stambough, physicians who have treated transgender minors in Arkansas.
The defendants are Attorney General Tim Griffin and the Arkansas State Medical Board.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

As he drove down the street, they called his name and begged him to play football. His daughter, Reena, was the weight on her father’s ankles when he did sit-ups. They watched “Popeye” together. 
“He would go to a record player and put on a 33 with Chubby Checker, and he would twist the night away,” Reena Evers-Everette recalled.
Those were just a few of the details shared at the Daddys’ Daughters Panel on Thursday night, an event where daughters of men killed while at tthe center of the civil rights movement shared intimate stories about life with their fathers.
Panelists included Reena Evers-Everette, daughter of Mississippi NAACP Field Secretary Medgar Evers, Bettie Dahmer, daughter of Vernon Dahmer, and Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
Joy Reid, political commentator and former MSNBC national correspondent, moderated the panel, one of a series of events honoring the legacy of Medgar Evers.
Reid also joined writer and professor W. Ralph Eubanks on Friday to discuss ‘The Power of the Word.’” Moderated by Ebony Lamumba, the panel explored the role of storytelling in the fight for racial justice.
All the “daughters” panelists shared memories about their fathers.

Vernon Dahmer, who was murdered after offering to pay poll taxes for African Americans in Forrest County so they could vote, played make believe with her with her tea set and taught her how to drive a standard shift truck, Bettie Dahmer said. 
His house was a refuge for the local community. He hosted Fourth of July picnics and allowed Boy Scout troops to camp on his land.
“It was safe,” Bettie Dahmer said. “We had other places where kids could come and be safe.”
That was until Jan. 10, 1966, when Klansmen attacked their home near Hattiesburg while the family slept, firing guns into the home. Vernon Dahmer grabbed his shotgun and fired back, enabling his family to escape out a back window, but flames from the blaze seared his lungs. He died a day later. 
Evers-Everette, whose father was shot in the back in the driveway of their Jackson home on June 12, 1962, says she was her father’s “princess.”

“Love is what resonates throughout my life, because that’s what I grew up with and that’s what my father instilled in us,” she said.
The panelists spent time honoring their mothers. Years after her father was murdered for fighting for voting rights, Bettie Dahmer’s mother Ellie would serve as an election commissioner. 
Evers-Everette credits her mother, Myrlie Evers, with the phrase “You can kill a man, but you can’t kill an idea.” 
Myrlie Evers later served as chairman of the NAACP.

Kerry Kennedy said her father, who as U.S. attorney general enforced civil rights legislation and as a senator advocated for voting rights and against discrimination, ran towards fires started during a civil rights protest instead of watching them on TV. He was assassinated after winning the California Democratic primary for president in 1968. Kerry Kennedy argued that Americans should adopt the stance her father had about taking action.
“We need our country today to run into the flames,” said Kerry Kennedy. “Because our country is on fire.”
The daughters talked about how to continue the legacies of their fathers and mothers.
“I hope each and every one of you understands the importance of the vote. It’s not just going and doing a checkmark. It’s a checkmark for your life,” Evers-Everette said. 
She hoped attendees would “remember that.”
“If you honor them, and you honor our fathers and our mothers — do something about it,” she said.

At the Panel of the Word, Reid, who wrote a biography of Medgar and Myrlie Evers, also spoke on the Pentagon’s proposal to’ rename the Navy cargo ship USNS Medgar Evers and the renaming of the oiler USNS Harvey Milk as the USNS Oscar Peterson.
Reid described history as “a series of stories of people who, through their resilience, survived enslavement, survived Jim Crow, survived hate, survived fear, and survived the abandonment of the federal government of our communities, and their stories collectively are what make history.” 
“And so, when you don’t know the impact of those stories, it’s easy to do a thing like strip Harvey Milk’s name off of a Navy battleship…threaten to do the same to USNS Medgar Evers,” she said.

Ralph Eubanks, author and visiting professor at the University of Mississippi
Referring to scholar Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s concept of “the single story,” Eubanks warned about anti-Diversity, Equity and Inclusion backlash in classrooms. “What is being imposed on us is — trying to impose on us — is a single story, and there is a real danger in that,” he said.
“I mean, think about what is happening with the DEI legislation in this state…Oxford, Mississippi, has 45 working writers, and…probably half of their work, including my own, could be banned,” he said.
Eubanks referred to the state’s new anti-DEI law, which prohibits public schools and state colleges and universities from a variety of practices related to DEI. This includes engaging in “divisive concepts.”  The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and several other civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit challenging the law. A federal judge is considering issuing a restraining order to block the law from going into effect.
Answering an audience member’s question, Reid and Eubanks both spoke on how Mississippi and the South are precursors to current national policies.
“So what’s happened is these Southern states have developed a version of what we’re now facing nationally, and so the shock is north of the Mason-Dixon line,” said Reid.
“We’re all living in Mississippi now,” said Eubanks. “Everybody in this county has at least one foot in Mississippi whether they want to admit it or not.”

A former employee is suing The Greenwood School in Putney for allegedly permitting sexual harassment and discrimination and breaching an implied contract. 
The trial date has been set for March 1, 2026.
A former administrative assistant for The Greenwood School alleged that the school’s administration failed to adequately address recurrent sexual harassment that she experienced from a student, according to the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court of Vermont by attorney Theodore Kramer in June 2024. 
The employee resigned from her post at The Greenwood School — a specialized boarding and day school, serving neurodivergent students from grades 6 to 12 — in January 2024 due to the “sexually hostile environment.”
The complaint describes a student repeatedly “inappropriately touching” the former employee as well as making comments, facial expressions and engaging in “other acts of a sexual nature” directed at the former employee between May and November 2023. 
When the former employee reported the first incident, in which the student pulled her toward him and touched her buttocks, the dean of students said that the student had “‘mommy issues’ and was looking for a connection,” the complaint states. 
The complaint goes on to describe several times when the student touched her breasts, buttocks and other parts of her body despite the former employee asking the student to stop, and after she reported the instances to the administration. 
The former assistant “specifically recalls the head of school telling her to ‘get over it’ and ‘nothing is ever solved by worrying about what has already happened’” after she wrote a letter to the administration about her concerns in November 2023, according to the complaint. 
The administration and faculty at the Greenwood School were allegedly aware that the student had a pattern of “inappropriately touching faculty members, students and parents of students,” according to the complaint.
The student was barred from the administrative building by the head of the middle school in September 2023 after the student engaged in “continued sexual assaults and harassment,” the complaint states. 
The former employee continued to bring her concerns to administrators after harassment occurred, but the school “took no action to investigate or correct the hostile work environment,” the complaint states. 
The lawsuit argues that the alleged hostile work environment interfered with the former employee’s ability to execute her work duties, negatively impacted her mental and physical wellbeing and led to her resignation. 
The complaint also asserts the school breached an implied contract established in the school handbook by “failing to uphold policies and procedures” and not safeguarding the former administrative assistant from the “many examples of harassment” that occured during her employment. 
The former employee is seeking redress in the form of monetary compensation and attorneys fees as well as any “further relief the Court deems proper” during the trial scheduled for next year. The Greenwood School Head of School did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The attorney for the former employee declined to comment while the case is pending in court.

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Attorney General’s Office requested an execution date on Friday for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward, the Spencer County man convicted in 2007 for the rape and murder of 15‑year‑old Stacy Payne. 
A date has not yet been set. A decision on the state’s motion is up to the Indiana Supreme Court.
“We are stunned that they have moved for a date given the very public statements of the governor that the cost is something that should be explored and that this is something the governor wanted the legislature to look at,” defense counsel Larry Komp said in a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
“Given the budget shortfalls, citizens deserve an explanation as to why Indiana spent over a million dollars for controlled substances, from some undisclosed source that is reaping a huge financial windfall at the expense of Indiana citizens,” he continued. “This is especially true given the public descriptions that the drugs did not work how they should have in Mr. Ritchie’s execution.”
Ward, now 52, was originally convicted and sentenced to death in 2002, but the state’s high court justices overturned the verdict due to “prejudicial pre-trial publicity,” according to legal documents. 
Story continues below.
Verified Motion to Set Execution Date (1)
 
The case was sent back to the lower court, where Ward later pleaded guilty and a second jury again sentenced him to death in 2007. 
The Indiana Supreme Court previously set Ward’s execution for December 11, 2012, but that date was automatically stayed due to ongoing federal appeals. No new execution date was set while those legal challenges remained unresolved in the courts.
Ward has since exhausted all state and federal appeals.
Court records indicate Ward attacked Payne after she answered the door of her Dale, Indiana, home shortly after noon on July 11, 2001. Her younger sister heard screams and called 911. Police arrived within minutes and found Ward standing in the doorway of the home, holding a knife. He was arrested at the scene. 
Payne later died from severe injuries, including stab wounds and disembowelment.
Payne was an honor roll student who worked at Jenk’s Pizza, according to her obituary. She was a cheerleader and won awards for public speaking.
Ward’s execution, if approved, would be the third in Indiana since December 2024, following a 15‑year hiatus. Joseph Corcoran was executed by lethal injection in December under former Gov. Eric Holcomb, and Benjamin Ritchie followed in May 2025 under new Gov. Mike Braun. Both executions used a single‐drug protocol of pentobarbital.
Since executions resumed, debates have increased over the high cost and uncertain supply of the drug. 
Braun clarifies Indiana acquisition of execution drugs; reveals more than $1M spent

Reporting by the Capital Chronicle revealed this week the state spending has so far exceeded $1 million for four doses of pentobarbital: half were used and the other half expired. 
The drugs were purchased in two transactions — one under Holcomb and one under Braun.
In total, $1.175 million was spent, Braun said. But two doses — worth $600,000 — expired without use because “they had been on the shelf too long.” Braun said earlier this month that the drug has a 90-day shelf life.
Braun emphasized earlier this week that neither of the doses used by the Indiana Department of Correction in December and May were expired when administered to inmates.
It’s not clear when exactly the state acquired the doses or from where they were purchased. Indiana Code protects the identity of the seller from public scrutiny. State officials had previously declined to provide details about how much pentobarbital was purchased, and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
Braun, a Republican in his first year as governor, has repeatedly said the question of whether Indiana should continue to carry out executions is one that lawmakers should weigh in the months ahead. 
“There are legislators that wonder if it’s still relevant,” he said earlier this month. “I’m going to listen to them, the courts, and the broader discussion in general.”
The governor’s office did not immediately reply to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about the execution date request for Ward.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Iowans prepare to celebrate the 4th of July, a new state law going into effect Tuesday will loosen restrictions on setting off fireworks on July 3 and 4 in some communities.
Senate File 303 was signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May. The law, which takes effect July 1, prevents county boards of supervisors and city councils from banning and limiting the use of consumer fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31 that are more restrictive than state regulations.
Iowa local governments have the ability to set regulations on fireworks in their jurisdictions. Iowa communities like Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City and Dubuque ban the use of consumer fireworks within city limits. Others, like Waterloo, Ankeny and Davenport, have restrictions on fireworks being set off outside of certain dates — typically for Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve celebrations.
The Des Moines City Council — as well as several other local government bodies — have made changes, or are in the process of aligning their local ordinances with the new state law, which requires all local jurisdictions to suspend limits on consumer fireworks for celebrations on these three days. However, it still allows local governments to keep in place bans and limits on fireworks for other times of the year, in addition to requiring Iowans to still follow other regulations on fireworks use existing in state code.
Iowa law limits the legal use of all fireworks to be between June 1 through July 8 and Dec. 10 through Jan. 3 of each year. During these timeframes, consumer fireworks can only be set off between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. each day. Fireworks are allowed to be set off until 11 p.m. on July 4 and the weekends before and after the Fourth of July, and can be set off from 9 a.m. Dec. 31 until 12:30 a.m. Jan. 1.
State code also contains other regulations on fireworks, including a ban on the sale of fireworks to people under age 18 and a prohibition on individuals and organizations setting off “display” fireworks — bigger fireworks often used in professional shows — without permission from their local government. Setting off fireworks in a public park or other city property is also still banned without local approval, as state law bans the use of consumer fireworks outside of a person’s own property or that of someone who has consented to fireworks being used at their property.
The city of Des Moines issued a news release Wednesday warning Iowans that while the state law has changed, fireworks can still not be set off at Des Moines parks or on streets and sidewalks. The news release said in 2024, a third of the city’s 77 parks reported damage or needed cleanup because of unlawful fireworks use, with some parks needing to be shut down to address damages.
“We ask that our residents use fireworks during the permitted times and in the permitted locations respectfully this year,” Des Moines Mayor Connie Boesen said in the release. “That means keeping fireworks to private property and especially out of our Parks to preserve those spaces for our community to use.”
When the law was moving through the Iowa Legislature earlier this year, Democrats speaking on behalf of local governments and law enforcement criticized the measure, saying the areas that had banned consumer fireworks because of the public safety hazards caused by fireworks. But Republicans, including Rep. Bill Gustoff, R-Des Moines, floor manager for the measure in the House, said the change was needed to allow Iowans to fully celebrate the Fourth of July without fear of breaking local laws.
Gustoff said allowing these celebrations was especially important this year in light of President Donald Trump’s plan to launch celebrations in Iowa leading up to the nation’s 250th anniversary July 4, 2026.

Those who live by the proposed site “will be directly impacted by its noise and air pollutants, and will suffer traffic safety impacts and congestion impacts,” said Jim Dumont, a Bristol-based attorney representing Essex residents.

ESSEX JUNCTION — The town’s Development Review Board has asked Amazon to provide traffic assessments of three comparable sites after residents took issue Thursday with the traffic study filed for a proposal to build a 107,000-square-foot distribution facility in Essex’s verdant Saxon Hill.
The site plan, dubbed Project Moose by developers, calls for building the facility and 482 parking spaces at 637 Kimo Drive in an area zoned Preservation District-Industrial (RPD-I), and seeks a waiver for the required 50-foot buffer between the property and the street. If the plan passes, it would be the first Amazon facility in Vermont.
The board on Thursday discussed a traffic impact study submitted by Langan Engineering and a peer review of it by Stantec commissioned by the town.
“Through our conversations, we find that one of the most important and vital pieces to us is really the greater detail about the traffic studies,” board chair Ian Carroll said at 10:07 p.m., after a two-hour private session in the middle of the 6:30 p.m. public hearing on the project proposed by Scannell Properties.

The commercial real estate development company headquartered in Indianapolis has spearheaded warehouse and distribution facilities for Amazon in several states.
“We’d like some post-monitoring assessments of three identified comparable sites, both comparable in size to the current proposal as well as to population,” Carroll said.
Jonathan Greeley, economic development lead for Amazon in New England, pushed back on the request. He said they have “more than accurately overestimated what our traffic impact is going to be” for the proposed project, and that it wasn’t just a study “taken off a shelf.”
“It’s in light of our own self interest that if we’re putting forth traffic counts and putting forth projections, and if we know we’re going to be monitored, that we’re accurately doing so, and so I just want to make sure the board understands we didn’t just make some stuff up,” he said.
Daniel Clarey, senior traffic engineer at Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, further clarified that the overall traffic study was approved by the town, the Vermont Agency of Transportation and the town-appointed consultant Stantec.
Slated as a distribution site, the project would bring “even traffic” with vehicles dropping off packages, loading and leaving quickly, he said.
Besides daytime van trips by workers, the proposal estimates one or two tractor trailers per hour between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., arriving possibly from Massachusetts and Connecticut. Workers at the proposed facility would sort and load packages into Amazon-branded vans to be delivered to homes and businesses within roughly 70 miles.
While Amazon responded Wednesday to the Stantec review of the traffic study, the town has not yet had a chance to examine the letter, said Carroll, who called for a continuance before a decision is made.

Earlier in the evening, resident Duane Millar Barlow said he had contacted several engineering firms to conduct a review he was willing to pay for but found they were reluctant to challenge a peer company’s work.
He submitted a letter disputing the town-commissioned Stantec assessment. 
“Though written in a diplomatic tone, it is a thorough discrediting of the Langan statement’s central conclusion: that the project’s traffic impacts are acceptable and that no further study is warranted.”
Others took issue with a study looking at potential scenarios and said Amazon needs to come back with a study that looks at the actual traffic impacts at similar facilities.
Linda and Tom Merchant, truck drivers and neighbors near Sand Hill Road, said the plan isn’t realistic, especially when accounting for the weather, traffic, accidents and inspections.
Process “unfair”
The third continued hearing drew resident criticism of the plan to clear almost 23 acres of woodland and add construction and truck traffic in an area that is currently forested and near a residential neighborhood.

More than 70 attended the meeting Thursday night with an additional 58 joining remotely, according to town officials.
Emotions ran high from the start of the four-hour long meeting as the chair of the volunteer seven-member board administered an oath calling for civility and limited comments to two minutes.
Speakers cited health and environmental concerns and highlighted Amazon’s record of hazardous and low-paying working conditions in continued opposition to the proposed project.
Those who live by the proposed site “will be directly impacted by its noise and air pollutants, and will suffer traffic safety impacts and congestion impacts,” said Jim Dumont, a Bristol-based attorney representing 23 Essex residents and a newly formed nonprofit called ACRES, an acronym for Alliance of Concerned Residents Envisioning Solutions.
Residents also pointed to the fire department’s March recommendation that the project be required to complete the road connecting the end of Kimo Drive to Thomson Drive. Without it traffic will be forced to one choke point, causing “substantial risk for crashes in winter”  and increased traffic on Saxon Hill Road.
Residents were particularly upset when the board cut short public comment around 8 p.m. to go into a private deliberative session — but not an executive session — that ran two hours.
“It’s a kangaroo court,” Dumont called out as members left the room.

“I’ve seen enough stuff here that undermines my confidence in this town’s governance, in particular over Saxon Hill,” said Bruce Post, a former selectboard member.
As residents and the consultants waited late into the evening for the board to resume, the owners of Phoenix Books, which has stores in Essex and Burlington, provided pizza and seltzer.
Many said they were upset they haven’t been given the same courtesy of time and information as the developers. 
The applicants had known about the meeting since June 10, but the town didn’t post the agenda until one hour after the window for submitting written testimony had passed last Friday, Barlow said.
“The process has been unfair,” he said. “So by the time we knew that this meeting was happening, we couldn’t even submit a letter.”
The public has until 9 a.m. the Friday before a scheduled meeting to provide any written comment, according to Katherine Sonnick, the town’s community development director. The agenda and packet are published around midday Friday, after which no new information can be provided to the board.
The continued public hearing — possibly July 17 — will be confirmed by Monday, Sonnick wrote in an email Friday.

Although the area was rezoned industrial 50 years ago, the 22.94-acre lot off Thompson Drive eyed for the project in Saxon Hill is largely undeveloped, consisting mostly of woodlands and meadows where Vermonters bike and hike, and has historically been mined for sand and used as a tree farm, Scanell’s memo, dated Jan. 30, states.
The lot was established in March after the Development Review Board approved a five-lot subdivision as Phase 2 of the Saxon Hill Industrial Park.
As public opposition to the Amazon facility gathers steam in Essex, Ken Signorello, the chair of the town’s conservation and trails committee, has written a protest song. “With buffers cleared, paradise gets lost to make a parking lot for Amazon town,” he sings, strumming a guitar in the woods of Saxon Hills.

(Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)The ACLU of Idaho on Thursday sued Idaho government officials over a new state law that will prevent unauthorized immigrants from accessing publicly funded assistance.
The new law, approved by the Idaho Legislature this year through House Bill 135, takes effect on Tuesday. It will cut the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. 
ACLU’s lawsuit in federal court seeks to stop Idaho from applying the expanded immigration status check requirement for HIV treatment, alleging the new state law is unconstitutional by violating equal protection, conflicts with federal laws and even denies federal funds to people eligible under federal law.
The lawsuit requests temporary judicial blocks — saying without the care, patients could die.
“Nobody benefits from barring access to life-saving HIV medication,” Dr. Abby Davids, an Idaho doctor who is part of the lawsuit and works at Full Circle Health, said in a statement. “Both for individual patients and for the health of our community as a whole, all people living with HIV need to be able to access consistent care and treatment. Infections like HIV do not infect people based on their immigration status, and treatment should not be limited by legal status, either.”

 Lawsuit filed against Idaho Health and Welfare, attorney general, other officials

Joined by the National Immigration Law Center, and the private law firms Nixon Peabody LLP and Ramirez-Smith Law, ACLU is representing five immigrants and a doctor in Idaho. The lawsuit seeks class-action status to protect all people who are and could receive treatment through the federally funded programs.
ACLU’s lawsuit is against Idaho health officials, including Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams, along with Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador.
“We are still reviewing the lawsuit and will respond in court after we have had a chance to fully review the complaint and other documents filed,” Idaho Attorney General Office spokesperson Damon Sidur told the Idaho Capital Sun on Friday.
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment, saying the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
In a news conference Friday, ACLU of Idaho Legal Director Paul Carlos Southwick called the lawsuit a start. But he said the group learned about, and plans to sue over, another program that Health and Welfare plans to apply the new immigration check law to — the food assistance program for Women, Infants and Children, called WIC.
“We’ve essentially been having to pull this info from (the health department)” and service providers, Southwick said.
 Idaho health department hasn’t said what immigration statuses will be approved, lawsuit alleges

For people who apply for public assistance benefits in Idaho, state agencies are largely required to verify lawful presence. 
But the new law will remove some exceptions for certain services, requiring state agencies to verify someone’s immigration status for access to health assistance for immunizations, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children. 
Emergency services will remain exempt from the immigration status verification requirement under the new law.

The lawsuit alleges the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare has not responded to the suing doctor’s questions about what immigration statuses would be considered “lawfully present.”
One of the immigrants suing Idaho officials, identified only as K.P. in the lawsuit, fears that her employment authorization document and pending asylum application “are not sufficient to satisfy the immigration status verification requirements” under the bill. 
Because of treatment through Full Circle Health, her HIV is undetectable — and she won’t transit the virus to people who don’t have it, the lawsuit says. When she was pregnant, her medication prevented her from transmitting HIV to her daughter, the lawsuit says. 
Her next refill is scheduled for July 8 — a week after the bill takes effect. 
Southwick, with ACLU of Idaho, said in a statement the new law is the second unconstitutional Idaho bill the group has sued over this year. A federal judge swiftly blocked an Idaho immigration enforcement law soon after it took effect — in response to an ACLU of Idaho lawsuit. 
The public benefits bill “is designed to dehumanize our immigrant neighbors by denying them the basic necessities of life — medicine, food, and shelter. It subverts constitutional rights and interferes with federal regulation of immigration,” Southwick said. “… It is part of the state’s campaign to displace immigrant residents, which will separate families and inflict lasting trauma. The state’s actions are legally indefensible and morally wrong.”

(Photo courtesy of the Minnesota Reformer). Jenny Boelter, wife of Vance Boelter, released her first public statement Thursday condemning the assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Vance Boelter is accused by prosecutors of killing the Hortmans and shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, on June 14.
“On behalf of my children and myself, I want to express our deepest sympathies to the Hortman and Hoffman families. Our condolences are with all who are grieving during this unimaginably difficult time, and we are praying daily for them,” Jenny Boelter wrote.
Authorities found lists written by Vance Boelter with the names and addresses of Democratic public officials, suggesting the attack was politically motivated. Boelter is alleged to have impersonated a police officer, visiting the homes of Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope and Rep. Kristin Bahner in Maple Grove in addition to the Hortmans and Hoffmans. Rest and Bahner were not harmed.
Vance Boelter texted his wife and other family members in the early hours of June 14, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.”
Jenny Boelter wrote that she and her family were “absolutely shocked, heartbroken and completely blindsided” by the attack and that it was “a betrayal of everything we hold true as tenets of our Christian faith.”
The statement says that Jenny Boelter received a call from law enforcement on June 14 and met with agents at a gas station. She said she answered questions, provided requested items and cooperated with searches.
“From the moment we were first contacted by law enforcement, we have fully cooperated with investigators and responded to their every request…We thank law enforcement for apprehending Vance and protecting others from further harm,” the statement said.
Vance Boelter was arrested the day after the assassination and has been charged with murder by both Hennepin County and federal prosecutors.
Jenny Boelter has retained legal representation from Halberg Criminal Defense, according to the statement. The law firm’s website says that it has taken on “many of the ‘high-profile’ cases in Minnesota.”

Joni Ernst uses Monopoly-themed props to advocate for legislation selling federal properties. (Screenshot from Sen. Ernst's YouTube channel) Iowans in Congress applauded the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision Friday to limit the power of federal courts to curb executive orders.
Also this week, Iowa Democrats also criticized tax credit cuts during “worst” agricultural trade deficit, Sen. Joni Ernst played “Washington-opoly” with “underutilized” federal properties, and Iowa’s delegation introduced many new bills.
The Supreme Court voted 6-3 Friday to narrow the scope of three universal injunctions passed by federal courts in Massachusetts, Washington and Maryland. These three courts passed injunctions halting the enforcement of Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S.
The decision does not address the constitutionality of ending birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants or children of parents with a temporary visa. The opinion also determined that Trump’s executive order can’t be put into effect for at least 30 days from Friday, providing time for legal challenges.
Here’s how Iowa lawmakers responded:
“Today’s decision is a significant step towards addressing the bipartisan problem of universal injunctions. I’m heartened to hear a supermajority of the Supreme Court echo what I’ve said repeatedly: judges’ constitutional authority is limited to deciding cases and controversies,” Sen. Chuck Grassley stated in a press release.  
“It’s a bad day to be an activist judge, but a great day for the American people,” said Rep. Ashley Hinson on X. “The Supreme Court correctly ruled that activist judges should not be able to unilaterally dictate national policy and stand in the way of the Trump agenda that over 70 million people voted for, including ending birthright citizenship. The days of illegal immigrants abusing birthright citizenship are numbered thanks to President Trump’s leadership.”
“I applaud the Supreme Court’s ruling to curb nationwide injunctions,” said Rep. Randy Feenstra in a post on X. “This decision will rein in the power of district court judges and restore the voice of the people. Americans elected President Trump and want to see his America First policies implemented and upheld.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion stating that: “The majority ignores entirely whether the President’s executive order is constitutional, instead focusing only on the question whether federal courts have the equitable authority to issue universal injunctions. Yet the order’s patent unlawfulness reveals the gravity of the majority’s error and underscores why equity supports universal injunctions as appropriate remedies in this kind of case.”
Iowa Democrats criticize tax credit cuts during ‘worst’ agricultural trade deficit
The Iowa Democratic Party, in a press release Wednesday, criticized the clean energy tax cuts outlined in the “big, beautiful” budget bill. Without clean energy tax credits, Iowa’s economy will take an additional hit at a vulnerable time, the party argues.
The release cites a study by Farm Bureau indicating U.S. agricultural trade debt for January to April 2025 clocked in at $19.7 billion, “the largest ever recorded for the first four months of a year.” Currently, $238 million in economic activity is “under threat” by clean energy tax credit cuts outlined in the Republican budget bill, according to the study. 
The release includes a survey from Wallethub,  which ranked Iowa’s state economy in last place for 2025. “This news could not have come at a worse time,” the Democrats’ release states.
“It’s time for Iowa’s representatives in Congress to stand up to Donald Trump, end his disastrous trade policies, and get to work on a new farm bill,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in the release. “Our farmers deserve leadership that will end this nonsense and let them make a living doing what they do best — feeding the world.” 
Ernst calls for selling ‘underutilized’ federal property
Sen. Joni Ernst introduced the FOR SALE act Wednesday to sell six vacant or “underutilized” federal properties in Washington D.C. In a press release, Ernst claimed selling the properties would generate $400 million in revenue and cancel over $2.9 billion in “overdue maintenance.”
Three of the six properties for sale are currently headquarters to cabinet agencies:
The James V. Forrestal Building, headquarters for the U.S. Department of Energy, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Hubert H. Humphrey Jr. building and the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, home to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
“The nonpartisan Public Buildings Reform Board says Washington’s ‘wasteful real estate practices would not endure for so long in a private sector company,” Ernst said on the Senate floor Thursday. “But when playing Washington-opoly, Uncle Sam doesn’t pay the costs for his wasteful decisions, you do!”
Nunn-led act to reduce regulations for small and mid-sized businesses unanimously passes House
Rep. Zach Nunn’s bipartisan ELEVATE act seeks to “reduce bureaucratic red-tape” for small and mid-sized businesses trying to raise capital investment. This bill will allow “emerging growth companies” to submit two years of audited financials instead of three when and seeks to reduce the cost and time burden of capital investment. The legislation was unanimously passed by House members Monday.
“When investment capital gets trapped on the coasts by large firms and D.C. regulators, it’s Iowa’s small businesses that suffer,” Nunn said in a press release. “The ELEVATE Act is a commonsense fix that would level the playing field for Iowa entrepreneurs looking to grow.”
Miller-Meeks reintroduces legislation to shield manufacturers from wildfire-related lawsuits 
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks reintroduced a bill to make manufacturers of critical infrastructure immune to wildfire-related lawsuits, “unless there is clear evidence of willful misconduct.” The bill was initially introduced by Miller-Meeks in 2024, but did not pass the House.
“No manufacturer should be driven out of business for building the components that power our homes, hospitals, and national defense,” said Miller-Meeks in a press release. “This bill protects the men and women who make the grid work, from transformers to transmission lines, and ensures they’re not punished for natural disasters beyond their control.”
Hinson reintroduces legislation to improve flood and drought mitigation
The Flood Resiliency and Land Stewardship Act reintroduced by Hinson seeks to bolster flood and drought mitigation programs through existing U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs. This bill would amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to include flood prevention and mitigation measures through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program.
“At the federal level, we must pursue proactive solutions that prioritize commonsense mitigation and flood prevention efforts to help save lives and livelihoods in the event of severe weather. While we can’t predict the weather, we can ensure we are prepared,” said Hinson in a press release. “I will continue working across the aisle to deliver certainty and protect our communities, businesses, and agriculture.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-27-at-4.01.23-PM-1024x554.png,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) Legislative Education Study Committee staff members Friday outlined their role in supporting the Public Education Department’s work in developing a plan for improving educational opportunities for at-risk New Mexico students.
LESC Director John Sena provided lawmakers with an update to the ongoing landmark Yazzie/Martinez educational equity case this week as they met in Roswell for the latest interim committee meeting. The remedial plan marks the latest court development in the lawsuit, which found in 2018 that the state was failing to provide low-income students, Native American students, English language learners and students with disabilities equitable education and services.
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson ordered the PED to develop the plan after parties returned to court in April to discuss the plaintiffs motion of non-compliance, filed in September 2024. Plaintiffs pointed to ongoing poor student performance and high turnover within the PED and proposed the LESC take the lead in developing an action plan. These specific markers were identified in a recent Legislative Finance Committee report shared with lawmakers this month.
Judge sides with plaintiffs in Yazzie/Martinez NM education equity case

Wilson agreed that a plan was needed, but decided that the PED would lead the development as the LESC is not a party in the case and the court does not have jurisdiction over the agency. However, the LESC was invited to assist the education department.
Sena shared a memo with lawmakers that the LESC sent to PED Secretary Mariana Padilla earlier this month that stated that agency staff would assist in an “advisory and technical role” by providing “nonpartisan research and fiscal analysis.” 
The memo also outlined several areas staff members will focus on, including participating in stakeholder meetings; providing relevant studies, original staff analysis and research concerning the at-risk student populations; identifying sections of state law that might need to be addressed; providing cost analysis for plan components; helping to identify characteristics of a suitable external consultant; and providing legislative context to the PED and consultant. 
“What we wanted to do for you all, as well as for clarity in terms of our partnership with the department, is say explicitly the kinds of things that we could do as staff to support that process so that there’s no muddiness around who’s doing what and who’s responsible for things. This is what we can lend our support to do,” Sena said during the meeting. 
The memo also noted that regular “coordination meetings” between the PED, LESC and external consultants would be beneficial.
The first deadline Wilson identified is July 1, by which PED is expected to identify an external consultant to develop the remedial plan. According to the LESC’s June newsletter, the PED issued a request for interest for a consultant and asked applicants to “describe their proposed approach to stakeholder engagement and how they would work with PED’s cabinet and legal counsel to develop a plan.”
PED spokesperson Janelle Garcia told Source NM that Padilla is in the process of communicating with applicants, but said a formal announcement of the chosen consultant will likely not be made until July 1.
Sena told lawmakers Friday that the PED received 10 to 14 applications and that the applicant pool was diverse, including national and New Mexico-based organizations. Once identified, the consultant will schedule meetings with stakeholders to help inform aspects of the plan.
“We have a really passionate group of what I like to call the usual suspects in education. These are folks who are really invested and we see them at our meetings, we see them at a lot of other stakeholder engagement opportunities.  Their voices are very powerful and important,” Sena said. “But I think it’s also important that we make sure we’re hearing from community members and a diverse group of folks that maybe we don’t always hear from, and so we’ll be putting that feedback forward for the [PED] to consider.”
The next deadline is Oct. 1, when the PED is expected to provide the court with a draft remedial plan. The department then has another month to finalize the plan. Plaintiffs then have until Dec. 1 to file objections to the plan with the court.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Yazzie-and-Travis-Mckenzie-embrace-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In the nearly 50 years since Alaskans overwhelmingly voted to create the Alaska Permanent Fund,  it has become a globally recognized sovereign wealth fund and a household name for every  Alaskan. It symbolizes the conservative nature and strength of character of our forebears, who  saved a portion of their generation’s money earned from Alaska’s natural resources to provide  financial benefits for all generations to come. The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation and our  dedicated team are tasked with and committed to protecting and growing the Permanent Fund for the benefit of every Alaskan. 
Alaska’s Permanent Fund has been an incredible success in achieving the shift from one-time resource revenue to a source of investment-driven renewable revenue. The first annual deposit of oil royalty revenue into the Permanent Fund was $734,000 in 1977. In the years since then, nearly $20 billion of state resource revenues have been saved and are part of the constitutionally protected principal of the Permanent Fund. An impressive achievement for our state, but dwarfed when compared to the investment performance during the same time frame that generated earnings totaling over $105 billion from our resource revenue savings.  
Fund earnings have been appropriated to pay the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, grow and inflation proof the Permanent Fund’s principal, and provide for state services. The permanently  protected principal has grown to $58.8 billion through royalty deposits, inflation proofing, and special appropriations. $47.5 billion has been paid out to support dividends and funding for  state services, and the balance of earnings has yet to be used.  











If you only fish for king salmon, you have a higher probability of a bad run and doing without than if you  also target sockeye, coho, dog, and pink salmon.



	The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation’s investment strategies and tactics are designed to make  sure that Alaskans consistently benefit from their fund in as broad a swath of economic times as  possible. At the heart of APFC’s strategy is an investment tactic referred to as diversification, or the practice of having a variety of investments that react differently from one another.  
Diversification is a means of stabilizing returns and mitigating risk. Many aspects of Alaskan life are great examples of this strategy. Take fishing, for example. If your goal today is to catch  enough salmon to feed your family through winter, you will better your chances by going after more than one species to reduce the potential risks of poor returns for any one species. If you only fish for king salmon, you have a higher probability of a bad run and doing without than if you  also target sockeye, coho, dog, and pink salmon. The diversification of the salmon species, habitat, foods, and run seasons creates greater assurance of catching than any single species can.  Diversification in investing is achieved by spreading investments across different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, infrastructure and private companies. As a result, if one part of  the market hits a rough patch, the entire fund isn’t dragged down with it. 
The board of trustees reviewed the fund’s overall investment mix at their most recent quarterly meeting. After thoughtful discussion and input from APFC staff and external advisors, the board maintained the current targets across the fund’s eight asset classes. This decision reflects our commitment to managing the fund for long-term performance to generate risk-aware returns while recognizing the importance of the annual 5% draw supporting state services and dividends.  While the board sets the allowed investments, it is the APFC team that brings the strategy to life. Our staff works every day to navigate changing markets and make careful decisions within the guardrails set by policy. This flexibility allows us to respond to economic shifts while staying  focused on the long-term goal: protecting and growing the fund for generations of Alaskans.  
Since the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund, Alaskans have demanded a conservative  approach to investing that provides long-term security and the ability to better withstand  inflationary and global economic swings. This approach means we aren’t putting all our assets in one type of investment but rather a diversified group of investments designed to have the highest chance of providing regular recurring funding for all of us today and for future generations of Alaskans.

Gavin Newsom for his signature, but it won’t take effect unless the Legislature makes changes to housing and infrastructure development rules that he has demanded.","In summary
A state budget is headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom for his signature, but it won’t take effect unless the Legislature makes changes to housing and infrastructure development rules that he has demanded.


After days of confusion in which a deal with Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to unravel over his demand to include new housing and infrastructure regulations, the California Legislature passed an updated state budget on Friday.
With the start of a new fiscal year looming on July 1, budget negotiations — already challenged by a $12 billion and growing deficit — dragged on this week as Newsom and legislative leaders struggled to reach an agreement on waiving state environmental reviews for priority projects.
The details of that proposal were only made public Friday morning, hours before the budget vote, despite a poison pill that would invalidate the entire $321 billion spending plan if the Legislature does not also approve the infrastructure proposal, Senate Bill 131. Lawmakers are expected to take it up on Monday, alongside the housing measure Newsom sought, Assembly Bill 130, which was unveiled and then amended this week following fierce blowback from organized labor.
Officials involved in those negotiations have been loath to explain why the budget process staggered to such an odd and protracted conclusion this year, even as California is now set to adopt sweeping changes to how it builds without much public notice. Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas refused to speak with reporters after the vote.
“I’m not going to comment on the process or any of that,” state Sen. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco Democrat who leads the Senate budget committee and was a driving force behind the infrastructure proposal, told CalMatters on Friday. “The people of California, I don’t think they care much about the timing. They just want us to deliver on making their lives more affordable.”
The Legislature, which already passed its own version of the budget earlier this month to meet a constitutional deadline, voted along largely partisan lines to approve the deal with Newsom. It will freeze enrollment of undocumented immigrants in California’s health care program for the poor, but relies on reserves and internal borrowing to avoid many other cuts to services that Democratic legislators opposed.
Republicans criticized the secretive deliberations and last-minute changes, noting that even some Democrats publicly complained this week about being sidelined from discussions with hugely consequential policy implications.
“I have been involved in more than a dozen public-sector budgets,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican, said on the Senate floor. “I have to say, this is the worst experience that I’ve had relative to navigating frustrations of the lack of transparency.”
But Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat who leads the Assembly budget committee, laughed off the drawn-out dealmaking, which he compared to one of his pregnant staffers.
“She was actually due to give birth five days ago, and so we’ve been having a debate in our office about which would come first: budget or baby,” Gabriel said on the Assembly floor. “Right now it looks like budget is going to win.”
California’s landmark environmental law at stake
The high-stakes showdown began last month, when Newsom endorsed two contentious pro-development bills by Bay Area Democrats and announced that he would fold them into the budget. Both make changes to the California Environmental Quality Act, which requires governments to study the environmental impacts of new housing and infrastructure projects they approve.
The five-decade-old law is sacrosanct to environmentalists, but critics argue that it has driven up the cost of building in California because studies and subsequent legal challenges, sometimes brought by construction unions or other groups that want concessions from developers, can take years to resolve. Newsom has framed his approach as a crucial reform to fix the state’s housing affordability crisis.
While the leadership of the Assembly got on board, the proposals were met with more skepticism in the Senate, where there is a growing rift among Democrats over whether simplifying project approvals without setting terms for affordable housing and labor standards is a giveaway to developers.

That prolonged the budget negotiations, even as Newsom and legislative leaders reached a difficult compromise on spending cuts.
When the budget bill eventually went into print on Tuesday, so that legislators would have enough time to pass it before July 1, officials were still haggling over the details of the infrastructure proposal. To ensure discussions would continue, Newsom demanded the inclusion of an unusual line stating that the budget “shall be inoperative and repealed” if SB 131 is not signed into law by June 30 at 11:59 p.m., though the measure was empty at that point.
The version that finally landed on Friday reduces the number of documents that projects must provide for their environmental reviews. It also eliminates the reviews entirely when cities rezone neighborhoods to meet their state-mandated housing goals, as well as for building a potpourri of other projects: farmworker housing, sewer systems in disadvantaged communities, broadband internet, public parks and trails, rural health clinics, food banks, advanced manufacturing facilities, day care centers and stations for the high-speed rail project.
‘Critical’ housing reforms
The related housing measure, intended as a grand political bargain to speed up construction in cities, threw another late wrench into the budget process.
It would exempt most new apartment buildings in already developed urban areas from environmental reviews, provided they meet local zoning rules. To secure support from organized labor, the bill originally created new wage floors for projects taking advantage of the law.
But powerful unions representing construction workers revolted after the proposal was introduced this week Their members crowded into hearings at the Capitol, casting it as a betrayal that would undercut higher “prevailing wage” standards that have long existed for publicly funded projects. Many Democratic lawmakers, who are closely allied with organized labor, eviscerated the measure.
Newsom and legislative leaders scrambled to contain the fallout. Amendments to the bill late Thursday stripped out the wage provisions while requiring projects taller than 85 feet or those that have 100% affordable units to offer prevailing wages if they want to access the expedited approval process. But that means many small apartment projects could sidestep environmental reviews without having to pay higher wages of any kind.
The bill retains another provision that unions asked for, giving them the right to take contractors to court for workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax violations.
Newsom praised the development proposals on Friday as a “triumph” and “one of the most significant housing reforms in California history” — so important to fixing the state’s shortage of affordable homes that they needed to be pushed through as quickly as possible.
“I did it because it’s critical and it’s essential that it was done,” Newsom told reporters in a virtual press conference. “We’ve got to get out of our own damn way.”

,DC,2025-06-27 21:36:55+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Weekend work on the mega-bill: first vote in US Senate as soon as Saturday,"Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/weekend-work-mega-bill-first-vote-us-senate-soon-saturday,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans appear ready to take an initial vote on their “big, beautiful bill” as soon as Saturday, which would set up final passage within a couple of days — though Majority Leader John Thune called the timeline “aspirational.”GOP senators have been negotiating the sweeping tax and spending cuts package for weeks, trying to ensure the dozens of provisions meet the complex rules for writing a reconciliation bill and can garner the support needed to actually become law.“We are continuing to explore options on all the outstanding issues,” Thune said Friday afternoon. But several Republican senators leaving a closed-door working lunch that lasted more than two hours told reporters they expect to see the final bill text possibly by Friday night before taking their first procedural vote at noon Eastern on Saturday.Republicans were still going back and forth with the Senate parliamentarian throughout the day as they tried to rework numerous policy changes she deemed not compliant with the guardrails for a reconciliation bill.The special legislative process gets Republicans around the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, but means the successful policy provisions need to have an effect on federal revenues, spending or the debt limit.There were still various outstanding disputes among GOP senators about how exactly the bill should be structured. If those are not resolved before amendment debate begins, it could lead to Republicans publicly splitting on issues related to Medicaid, tax policy and several other issues.Public lands, Medicaid provider taxMontana Sen. Steve Daines said he’s still waiting to see whether the parliamentarian accepts a revised proposal from Utah Sen. Mike Lee that would lead to a sell-off of some public lands.Daines didn’t want to comment on whether he’d bring up an amendment to strike the language from the bill, if it makes it into the final version of the package.""He's got to get it in the bill first. So it's a hypothetical at this point,” Daines said. “I think there's some trouble getting it through the parl. So I think that's the most likely scenario.”North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he believes Republicans have successfully reworked language addressing a change to the maximum percentage that states can set their Medicaid provider tax rate at. An earlier version reducing that rate from 6% to 3.5% over time was blocked by the parliamentarian. ""We think we've got it fixed, yeah. It's just like on a number of these issues. We think we have it fixed. We don't have the final word,” Hoeven said. “That's what we talked about earlier. We think we'll have the final word on this by the end of today, so we can start tomorrow.""The Medicaid provider tax rate would normally be considered in-the-weeds, but has become a central debate within the GOP amid major concerns about how changes would affect rural health care systems.Republicans may have also agreed to a final figure for a rural hospital fund meant to help offset the impact of Medicaid changes in the bill. That number will likely be higher than a previously floated $15 billion, but Hoeven didn’t say what the compromise will be. “The number you all saw is $15 billion. It's going to be bigger than that,” Hoeven said. “But I don't have a specific number yet.”Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins has been pressing for that fund to be at least $100 billion.SALT talksHoeven said that during the lunch, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., advocated for a $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, or SALT, for five years. The issue, also somewhat obscure, is crucial to the Senate bill making it back through the House, where GOP lawmakers from higher-tax states have been adamant the bill must help their constituents.Hoeven said the goal is to reach final agreement among Republicans and clear those changes with the parliamentarian, so the Senate can take its procedural vote on the bill Saturday around noon.Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said he thinks both chambers are getting close to reaching a final deal on the state and local tax deduction.“We still have some talking to do in the Senate, but I think we're getting close,” Mullin said, declining to get into numbers. Senators, he said, are planning to take the procedural vote around noon Saturday, setting up an amendment voting session that can last upwards of 12 hours and might begin later that day or Sunday morning.“There's a discussion about starting it earlier in the morning than in the middle of the night,” Mullin said. “So who knows?”The bill clearing the House could come shortly after the Senate passes its version of the package, since that chamber’s 72-hour rule starts winding down once the Senate’s bill text is released, not once the Senate actually passes it.“Putting on my hat from the House side. The 72-hour rule may not even have to be applied here because we're amending the bill that's already been put out,” Mullin said. “But I think what Speaker Johnson wants to do is give adequate time to go through it, which would be kind of a 72-hour rule anyway.”Artificial intelligenceTexas Sen. Ted Cruz also said he expects the chamber will take the procedural vote around noon Saturday.Cruz expressed confidence that a section in his committee’s bill preventing state and local governments from regulating artificial intelligence if they want part of a $500 million fund will survive a possible floor amendment.“The provision is in the bill and I believe it will be in the final bill that passes,” Cruz said, appearing to brush aside weeks of criticism from fellow GOP lawmakers. Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno was optimistic that both chambers will be able to pass the package before the party’s self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.“Look, ultimately, at the end of the day, we'll be in good shape. We're going to get a bill across the finish line,” Moreno said. “The sausage-making can be ugly, but the final product is delicious.”Sen. Ron Johnson was not as upbeat as some of his colleagues, storming up the steps just outside the closed-door lunch after it wrapped up, not wanting to speak to reporters.“Notice I'm not really wanting (to) talk right now,” the Wisconsin Republican said.“Go back downstairs,” he told a large group of reporters.Asked about the timing of the procedural vote this weekend, Iowa GOP Sen.

Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, left, and Republican South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley. (South Dakota Searchlight photos)With just under a year to go before the 2026 primary election, Republican political dominoes have begun to fall in South Dakota.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson said Friday that he’ll make a “political announcement” Monday — widely expected to be a run for governor. 
Earlier Friday, state Attorney General Marty Jackley said he’s “preparing to run” for the seat Johnson will apparently vacate.
Jackley made his announcement to KELOLAND news in a story published Friday morning, saying “the fight is in Washington.”
“From fentanyl and methamphetamine pouring across the southern border to public corruption and wasteful spending in Washington, I want to work with President Trump to find solutions,” Jackley said in a KELO video.
Hours later, Johnson sent a press release saying he’ll make his own announcement at noon Monday at the Canopy by Hilton in Sioux Falls. He did not specify what he will announce.


Let us know what you think...


 

For Johnson, a run for governor would be the culmination of a political journey two decades in the making. The 48-year-old is in the midst of his fourth term in the U.S. House after previously serving as an elected member of South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission from 2004 to 2011. He served as chief of staff to then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard from 2011 to 2014 and then worked in the private sector for Vantage Point Solutions, a telecommunications company in Mitchell, prior to his election to Congress.
Johnson brings a load of campaign cash to the race, with more than $6 million of total money spread among his federal campaign committee and several federal or state political action committees.
Jackley, 54, previously served as U.S. attorney for South Dakota and then as attorney general, but his political career was interrupted by a loss to Kristi Noem in the 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary race. Jackley was again elected attorney general in 2022.
It was Noem’s departure from the governor’s office in January — with two years left in her final term — that triggered the current maneuvering in the South Dakota Republican Party. Noem is now leading the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Noem’s lieutenant governor, Larry Rhoden, took over as governor and is serving the remainder of Noem’s term. He has not announced whether he will seek the party’s nomination for governor in the June 2026 primary.
Two other candidates have already announced their bids for the Republican gubernatorial nomination: state House Speaker Jon Hansen and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden. Robert Arnold, a 19-year-old college student, has announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination.
Jackley is the first candidate to publicly announce his intention to run for the U.S. House. 
Jackley’s announcement will trigger a race for attorney general. Other major offices up for election next year in South Dakota include the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mike Rounds, who is expected to seek reelection. Democratic businessman and former state trooper Julian Beaudion is seeking his party’s nomination to challenge Rounds. Brian Bengs, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat against U.S. Sen. John Thune in 2022, has said he will run as an independent next year against Rounds.

Vermont schools are slated to receive $17 million in federal Covid-19 funds that were canceled by the Trump administration in March. 
The U.S. Department of Education reversed its decision to cancel the funding after a lawsuit led by 16 states and the District of Columbia, according to a Friday press release from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The decision also reinstates about $2.5 billion in K-12 funding for schools across the nation derived from the American Rescue Plan Act.
“This means that 19 school districts in our state will now receive funding that had been denied so that they can go forward with a wide variety of projects: summer programs, afterschool programs, school renovation,” Sanders said in a video message.

Sanders, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he spoke several times with Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, urging her to reverse the cuts. He also worked with 19 school districts in the state to present 88 appeals to the fund cancellations.
“The (Vermont Agency of Education) is encouraged by this development and is working diligently to confirm allowable project costs and next steps associated with the announced changes in process. We are committed to continuing to partner closely with every impacted district and will be providing more details and next steps to the field through our weekly office hours,” Toren Ballard, director of policy and communications at the Vermont Agency of Education, told VTDigger following the announcement.
The money, originally allocated through a Covid-19 grant — the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds, or ESSER — had to be spent by Sept. 30, 2024, but the Biden administration approved an extension, so schools could continue using the remaining funds during the 2025-26 school year.
“We used the funds for specific purposes including employing targeted staff for instructional interventions and we also used a considerable portion to fund our summer academy program for students as we were placing an emphasis on learning loss as a result of COVID,” Harwood Unified Union School District Superintendent Mike Leichliter wrote in a statement to VTDigger.
Leichliter said the previously allocated funds have already been used, but the school district is waiting to receive the final $502,000 ESSER grant payment. 
“During a time of tremendous financial stress on our education system in Vermont, if the originally promised federal funds were not released, it would have led to increased pressure on our schools,” he wrote.

The state’s new program was slated to start releasing funds to families for private schooling and other non-public school costs on Tuesday. Now, a judge has temporarily blocked the release of any funds.
The post Judge orders Wyoming to temporarily withhold school voucher payments  appeared first on WyoFile .","A Laramie County District Court judge on Friday blocked Wyoming from releasing funds related to its new universal school voucher program until he issues a written order on a lawsuit against the state.  
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act was slated to begin sending out money on Tuesday. Since applications opened in May, Wyoming families have submitted nearly 4,000 student applications. The program would give applicants up to $7,000 annually in public funds for private education costs — though money would go directly from the state to providers.   
However, a June 13 lawsuit filed by the Wyoming Education Association and several parents challenged the program’s constitutionality and asked for a preliminary injunction to block it from going into effect. 
Judge Peter Froelicher granted a temporary injunction Friday. His decision essentially means that while the voucher program can continue to vet and accept applications, it cannot begin to disburse scholarship money. 
“I will take the matter under advisement, issue a written decision,” Froelicher said at the end of the Laramie County District Court hearing. “In the interim, I am going to narrowly enjoin the expenditure of any funds. The program may continue otherwise preparing for the expenditure of funds … I don’t see the harm in that at this point.”
Froelicher believes he can issue his written order by “mid-July-ish,” he said. 
The judge also granted a motion to intervene filed by two Wyoming families represented by EdChoice Legal Advocates and the Institute for Justice. Those families sought to join the state to defend the law so their children can access the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act funds. 
The outcome of the case will shape the landscape of school choice in Wyoming and answer a long-asked question about the state’s constitutional right to give public money to families, regardless of need, for private school costs. 
School choice expansion 
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act represents a significant expansion of school choice in the state, offering families $7,000 per child annually for K-12 non-public-school costs like tuition or tutoring. The scholarship also offers money for pre-K costs, but only to income-qualified families at or below 250% of the federal poverty level.
It comes as a school-choice movement mounts nationwide, particularly among conservatives.

Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, who sponsored and championed the Steamboat Scholarship bill, called the state’s 2024 education savings account program much too narrow. His 2025 bill, in its original form, made the program universal and dropped the preschool component, statewide assessments or similar nationwide tests for students and a requirement that providers be certified by the Department of Education.
The bill ignited one of the hottest debates of the recent session. It sparked a deluge of constituent feedback, according to lawmakers, both from supporters of school choice and critics who called it an unconstitutional measure that will erode the quality of public education inWyoming. 
Lawmakers transformed it before it passed out of the Legislature; they brought 26 amendments, including 11 that passed. The final version reinstated the assessment requirements, the provider certification and the inclusion of pre-K, though families have to show income need to qualify for that portion. 
Legislators repeatedly questioned the constitutionality of the expanded program. Many also urged the body to hold off and allow the existing ESA program to roll out and work out any bugs before changing it so drastically. 
The lawsuit
Nine parents of school-aged children and the Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, filed the lawsuit June 13. Parents reside in counties across the state. Many have children who receive special education services through public school or are queer or non-binary.
The lawsuit argues the voucher program violates the Wyoming Constitution, which makes public education a paramount state commitment. It asks the court to block the voucher program with a preliminary injunction. 
A previous Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on education funding “found that ‘education is a fundamental right’ in Wyoming, that ‘all aspects of the school finance system are subject to strict scrutiny,’ and that ‘any state action interfering with [the right to equal educational opportunity] must be closely examined before it can be said to pass constitutional muster,’” the lawsuit reads.
This voucher program, the lawsuit asserts, does not pass that muster. That’s because “the state cannot circumvent those requirements by funding private education that is not uniform and that meets none of the required state constitutional standards for education.”
In addition, the program is unconstitutional because it violates constitutional language that allows the state to funnel public funds to private entities only for the necessary support of the poor, the lawsuit reads. 
Parents who signed onto the case oppose the voucher plan due to the harmful impact it will have on their children, according to the lawsuit, “because private schools receiving voucher funding can refuse admission to children with disabilities … and are not required to provide special education services or comply with [individualized education programs].” They are also concerned that private schools can refuse to admit and educate children who identify as queer, transgender or non-binary.

The voucher program will also negatively impact funding at public schools that the parents’ children attend, the lawsuit says, because as students leave public schools, they will lose funding under models that rely on enrollment numbers. 
The Wyoming Legislature has established standards and oversight concerning the nature and quality of education that Wyoming students receive in public schools. But there is no mechanism to authorize Wyoming’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder to ensure those same standards and quality are furnished through the voucher program, the lawsuit states.
“Despite charging the Superintendent with administering the Program, the statute explicitly deprives her of any authority to ensure students utilizing the program receive a quality education,” the lawsuit reads. “In effect, the Program is a black box: funds will go in, but except in isolated instances the state and the public will have no way to know what is coming out.”
Nothing in the statute, the lawsuit concludes, “prevents instruction from being perfunctory, or worse.”
The lawsuit comes on the heels of a significant court decision that resulted from another Wyoming Education Association lawsuit filed in 2022. That legal challenge argued that the state violated its constitution by failing to adequately fund public schools and withholding appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security. Eight school districts joined the lawsuit as intervenors to challenge the state.
In that case, Judge Froelicher ruled in favor of plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to fix a funding formula he determined to be impacting Wyoming children’s right to a proper education.
Defense and intervenors
On Friday, the state’s attorney, Mackenzie Williams, argued that the voucher program does not pose imminent or irreparable harm to the plaintiffs’ right to education, and therefore the judge should not approve a preliminary injunction. 
The voucher program is funded by the general fund, not school funds, he said, “and so I would say it’s not part of the school finance system.”

The real question for the court ultimately to decide, Williams said, is whether or not the Legislature is meeting its constitutional duty to provide adequate education in public schools. If it is, the constitution does not prohibit the Legislature from creating other educational programs, he argued.
Thomas Fisher, representing the intervenors, said the two families he’s representing and thousands of others in Wyoming are “ready and in the process of signing their agreements to receive these ESAs.
“That is the status quo that the plaintiffs seek to upend,” he said, adding that only a clear showing of unconstitutionality plus proof of irreparable harm are sufficient to disrupt that status quo while the case plays out further. 
The pause of those funds, he said, will result in “significant financial harm” for the families expecting and planning on the money.
Following the hearing, Wyoming Education Association President Kim Amen celebrated the court’s “careful approach” in temporarily pausing the program. 
“Preserving the status quo allows time for a thorough review of the legal and constitutional issues involved, which are of great importance to Wyoming’s public education system,” Amen said. “We believe it’s critical that public funds remain dedicated to supporting the public schools that serve 93% of Wyoming’s students.”
Americans For Prosperity Wyoming, which lobbied heavily for the universal school voucher program during the legislative session, condemned Amen’s association Friday for hindering educational choice. 
“Today’s injunction is the latest effort by self-absorbed teachers’ union officials to stand in the way of Wyoming families’ ability to secure the best education possible for their children,” Americans For Prosperity Wyoming State Director Tyler Lindholm said in a statement.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach encouraged the Kansas State Board of Education to remove sex discrimination language from the state’s lunch contracts, the latest in his offensive against gender and identity politics.
In a letter to state education commissioner Randy Watson and board chair Cathy Hopkins, Kobach requested the board “comply with federal law and recent court rulings.” He took issue with wording in contracts for child nutrition and wellness programs, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include gender identity and sexual orientation.
“The inclusion of such language in school contracts is not only unnecessary but also contrary to federal law and the recent court ruling,” Kobach said Thursday in a news release.
In his first days in office, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that did away with diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, including broader definitions of gender identity and sex discrimination. Kobach said those orders, along with a Biden-era Title IX court case led by Kobach, are enough to warrant modification of school lunch contracts
The letter comes in the same week Kobach requested the U.S. Department of Education investigate four Kansas school districts that have policies allowing teachers to maintain confidentiality with children who are socially transitioning, which refers to the changes a person makes to the way they present themselves to align with their gender identity.
The four school districts in Kansas City, Olathe, Shawnee Mission and Topeka were the subject of a Title IX complaint from the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a conservative nonprofit founded by two former Trump administration officials.

This was the first of two major steps in completing the strategic combination of the two Catholic colleges, the next being approval by the U.S. Department of Education. Presidents of both universities came together with university staff and alumni on the Mount Mercy campus in Cedar Rapids Friday to announce the news and sign a pledge of shared commitment to their missions.
St. Ambrose President Amy Novak said approval is set to come through next summer, which is when the schools will fully combine.
“With the conclusion of this first step, St. Ambrose University now serves as the corporate owner of Mount Mercy University,” Novak said. “This action, however, is not a diminishment of one university or another, but rather a bold affirmation that together, we are all stronger.”

After about 18 months of work, Novak and Mount Mercy University President Todd Olson made the agreement in August 2024 for St. Ambrose in Davenport to eventually own Mount Mercy while maintaining its campus, branding and programming.
Twenty “integration teams” made up of staff, faculty, students, alumni and community members at both campuses have been working together on areas from information technology and back-end business to graduate programs, academic affairs, alumni and more — essentially helping the combination process cross the finish line, Novak said.
The groups vote every two weeks on decisions for the combination, like approving curriculum and the academic calendar. Novak said all the efforts being made are with the commitment to “carry forward the legacy and the charisms of both institutions with reverence” and find a place where everyone belongs.
“This is not simply one plus one equaling two,” Novak said. “This is one plus one equaling four or 10 or something even greater, as new synergies emerge and our shared mission and vision deepens.”
Along with celebration came concerns about how the combination could impact student finances or enrollment, to which Novak responded that tuition will remain the same at Mount Mercy and no scholarship awards will be changed “at this juncture.” Enrollment looks strong at both institutions, she added, though final numbers are not yet available.
Olson said he’s heard from students and families that the combination has inspired “renewed confidence” in the university’s future, which is helping to drive enrollment alongside the addition of a college football team.
Responding to a question about actions in Washington, D.C., impacting the combination process, Olson said current practices and future aspirations of the institutions appeal to “a variety of political perspectives,” as both universities operate based on their values and best practices to help students become professionals prepared for the workplace.
“We believe we are already providing a set of outcomes and services and people that are well-regarded across the political spectrum, and it’s certainly our intention to continue doing that,” Olson said.
The combination has drawn support from business and city leaders as well, Novak said, as it will bring new resources and more opportunities for partnership to the table for community development.
While it will bring benefits across the board to both university communities, Olson said the enduring goal behind Mount Mercy and St. Ambrose coming together is to provide the best possible education for their students and to ensure Catholic higher education’s future in eastern Iowa.
“This day represents a bright path forward for Mount Mercy and for St. Ambrose, and as we march down that path from here, we keep our mission at the center, and we keep our students at the center of our mission,” Olson said.

A Florida man who served his prison sentence handed down more than three years ago for his role in the EB-5 fraud that rocked Vermont is now seeking to shorten the length of his court-ordered supervised release.
An attorney for William Kelly filed a motion this week in federal court in Burlington asking Judge Geoffrey Crawford to end Kelly’s three years of supervised release a year earlier. 
“Mr. Kelly has used this experience to become a more responsible and accountable person,” Robert Goldstein, Kelly’s lawyer, wrote in a court filing. “He has demonstrated the stability and commitment to live a law-abiding life and would be grateful for the opportunity to continue doing so without the restrictions of supervised release.”
Neither Goldstein nor the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Vermont, which prosecuted the case, could be reached Friday for comment.

Crawford sentenced Kelly in April 2022 to 18 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to two charges: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and concealment of material information.
The judge also ordered Kelly to serve three years of supervised release following his prison sentence. The terms of Kelly’s supervised release include regular check-ins with his probation officer and travel restrictions.
Kelly, according to court records, was a key adviser to Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak ski resort, and an “assistant in executing decisions” who later took the lead in developing what regulators have termed a “Ponzi-like” scheme.
Kelly was indicted by a federal grand jury in Vermont in May 2019 along with Quiros and Bill Stenger, Jay Peak’s former president and CEO, for his role in a failed biomedical research facility planned for Newport.
More than 160 foreign investors seeking green cards in exchange for their investments each put at least $500,000 into the proposed $110 million facility known as AnC Bio Vermont.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later termed the project “nearly a complete fraud,” leaving the investors out of their investment and no way to meet the job creating requirements to secure their U.S. residency through the EB-5 visa program.
Prosecutors termed Kelly the “consummate fixer” who worked at trying to “outwit” regulators.
Stenger was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the case and has since been released. Quiros was sentenced to a five-year prison term that he continues to serve. 
Kelly, according to his attorney’s recent filing, in addition to serving out his prison sentence has roughly one year remaining of his three years of supervised release. 
Kelly, now 76, suffers from several medical conditions, including chronic diabetes and heart disease, the filing stated. 
“Since returning to the community, Mr. Kelly has worked diligently to rebuild and contribute positively,” his attorney wrote in the motion. “His family, church, and community have all been vital in his transformation, and he takes pride in trying to give back to his community in meaningful ways.”
Also, Kelly has been making his required monthly payments on the roughly $8.3 million in restitution that was part of his sentence, the filing stated. 
“Mr. Kelly also intends to continue paying restitution going forward; indeed, these payments are deducted from his social security benefits,” the filing stated.
The document does not specifically state how much Kelly pays monthly toward his restitution. However, other court filings show that the minimum payments were to be 10% of his gross earnings.
Crawford has made no ruling on Kelly’s motion for early termination of his supervised release and it’s not clear when that would take place, or if a hearing will be held on the matter.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A new report issued by legislative analysts on state election spending prompted a rebuttal to lawmakers Thursday from New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts report the Secretary of State’s office spent funding set aside for 2025 on the 2024 primaries, concluding that while the Department of Finance and Administration approved the action, it potentially meant the Legislature would have to provide additional funds for future costs, and likely violated the state Constitution.
The report notes that the cost of New Mexico elections has nearly tripled in recent years, in part due to major reform efforts by the Legislature allowing the state to manage local elections for cities and counties. The state spent approximately $15 million per election in 2024, according to the report.
Consolidating elections at the state level “can lead to greater efficiency and consistency,” the report says, but also opens the state to further risks. The largest costs in the elections included poll worker salaries, the number of polling locations and rising costs for election equipment.
The report notes the state could save $3.2 million by cutting 285 polling sites.
The report concludes the Secretary of State’s office needs to better predict the costs of elections by collecting more data for specific county costs; establishing further reimbursement guidelines; finding savings on election equipment; and potentially cutting state payments for county-determined polling sites and poll workers.
Toulouse Oliver told lawmakers the one finding of concern — that the office violated the state Constitution with election spending from a $15 million fund created by the Legislature in 2024 — came at the direction of the Department of Finance and Administration and LFC Director Charles Sallee.
“I want to be very clear that was not our idea of how to do things, and in fact, I expressed my opinion that it was very, very bad public policy,” she said.
In an interview with Source, Sallee described Toulouse Oliver’s comments as “pretty misleading testimony in my view.”
Sallee characterized the conversation he had with Toulouse Oliver as one that established the New Mexico Department of Finance Authority’s power to reimburse counties for expenses in the new fiscal year, for prior elections when legislation establishing the state’s $15 million Election Fund went into effect.
“It wasn’t like we told them to overspend; they had already overspent,” Sallee told Source.
Toulouse Oliver on Thursday criticized the report for being rushed, saying it provided “incomplete and premature conclusions.” Toulouse Oliver also noted that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had ranked New Mexico elections first in the nation last year for both security and accessibility.
“This is the first evaluation LFC has conducted on elections and it really failed to reflect the nuance, expertise and complexity,” she said.
In a rebuttal letter submitted alongside the report, Toulouse Oliver wrote: “Cutting funding for elections in New Mexico risks undoing all the great progress that has been made to modernize our elections in recent years and could compromise election security and voter accessibility.”
The recommendations to cut polling places, for example, could require voters to travel longer distances to cast a ballot, she said, adding the placement of voting centers should be left up to the counties.
Toulouse Oliver Legislature requested lawmakers provide funding for operations, as well as  projects for cybersecurity, data collection and education for both voters and county staff.
“We did not have enough money to get through this last pay period this year,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) asked Toulouse Oliver if the state would save money by conducting elections fully by mail, which occurs in Colorado, Utah, Washington and Oregon.
Toulouse Oliver said her successor — she is term-limited from running again — would be the best person to consider that change, but said it would most likely cut costs, especially when it comes to pollworkers.
“We’d still need a lot of people to help process those ballots but it wouldn’t be the number we’re using now,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Toulouse Oliver concluded by saying her office was aligned with many of the recommendations put forward.
“We think a lot of the recommendations in this report are good, and a lot of them are things we’re already working on,” she said. “We just need your help to get them over the finish line.”

According to the indictment, Earl Joe Nelson, while superintendent of Clarksdale Municipal School District and now Leake County School District, and Mario D. Willis, as superintendent of Hollandale School District, allegedly paid each other tens of thousands of dollars in school funds for consultant services that were never rendered from November 2021 until at least June 2023.
Additionally, the duo is accused of stealing U.S. Department of Education funds that were intended for their respective districts. 
A St. Louis-based consultant and teacher, Moneka M. Smith-Taylor, has also been indicted on bribery charges in connection with the case. She allegedly received more than $250,000 from Willis for consulting services that were never provided over the course of two years.
She returned part of that money to Willis in the form of a cash kickback in return for the consulting contract, the indictment says.
A spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Education directed Mississippi Today to local school boards, who make personnel decisions for their respective districts, for comment.
The job status of the two superintendents is unclear. District officials could not be reached by presstime, but Willis is still listed as the superintendent of Hollandale School District and Nelson is still listed as the superintendent of Leake County School District in the state education department’s online directory.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

(File photo by Getty Images)Some 290 South Carolinians will lose their jobs as a pair of lumber mills close in the Pee Dee and Lowcountry.
Canfor Corp. announced Friday it would shutdown two of its South Carolina sawmills — one in Darlington and another in rural Hampton County, near the small town of Estill.
“We understand the significant impact this difficult decision will have on our employees,” Canfor Southern Pine President Lee Goodloe said in a statement.
The Darlington plant employs about 120 people, and the Estill plant employs about 170 people. Layoffs will start Aug. 25 and continue over the next six months, according to filings with the S.C. Department of Employment and Workforce.
Canfor attributed the closure to “persistently weak market conditions and sustained financial losses.”
The company, which operates in the southeastern United States, western Canada and Sweden, suffered a $942 million operating loss in 2024 and $29 million of losses in the first three months of 2025, according to earnings statements. Much of that loss came from U.S. operations and low demand for the southern yellow pine common to South Carolina.
“Looking ahead, North American lumber markets are anticipated to experience continued volatility and uncertainty throughout the second quarter of 2025. Ongoing affordability challenges and tariff-related disruptions to traditional trade flows are projected to result in tepid demand in the near term,” the company wrote in its latest financial report.
Canfor had already curtailed one shift at its Darlington facility and reduced operating hours in Estill.
Lumber mill pledges 125 new jobs in rural Allendale County

In Hampton County, the Estill mill was one of just six employers with more than 100 workers, according to the state employment agency.
But with one loss comes a different gain.
The Estill mill sits just across the county line and less than 15 miles away from a new sawmill planned for Allendale County.
Hampton Lumber announced Tuesday that the town of Fairfax would become home to its first East Coast sawmill, employing 125 South Carolinians. Production is scheduled to begin in 2027.
Canfor continues to operate mills in Camden and Conway, as well as a smaller facility in Marion and a corporate office in Myrtle Beach, according to its website.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wood-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X video)Two environmental groups filed a lawsuit in a South Florida federal court on Friday over the immigration detention center under construction in the Everglades that has been dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
They later filed a motion for expedited relief, seeking entry of a temporary restraining order by July 1.
Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed the suit in the U.S. District Court Southern District of Florida against federal, state, and local agencies: the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Florida Division of Management, and Miami-Dade County.
The environmental groups complain the plan has not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law, and that the public has not had an opportunity to comment.
“The site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida Panther and other iconic species,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “The scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect.”
The plan has developed at lightning speed. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier first announced “Alligator Alcatraz” in a video posted on his X account eight days earlier, on June 19. In that video, he announced that the facility would hold up to 1,000 undocumented migrants (state officials have since revised that total to as many as 5,000 detainees).
The site is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport on land owned by Miami-Dade County. The Florida Division of Emergency Management reached out last week to Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and offered to purchase the land for $20 million. Levine Cava said that figure was “vastly lower” than the more recent appraisal of the site, “which is at least $190 million.”
Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Division of Emergency Management, responded that his agency would seize the property pursuant to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ powers originally dating from a January 2023 executive order declaring a state of emergency “due to the mass migration of illegal aliens to Florida.”
Groups claim the plan threatens the restoration of the Everglades 
The two groups claim in the lawsuit that the division holds no independent authority to construct and manage a correctional facility and attempting to do so exceeds the scope of authority granted by Florida law.
They also contend that “the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services system, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts” to listed species, wetlands, and surface waters.
Friends of the Everglades is requesting that the court declare that the project violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and stop the state from authorizing or permitting further development or use of the site for purposes of a detention center.
“This plan has had none of the environmental review that’s required by federal law,” said Tania Galloni, managing attorney for the Florida office of Earthjustice, which represents Friends of the Everglades in the lawsuit. “Cruelty aside, it defies common sense to put a mass of people, vehicles, and development in one of the most significant wetlands in the world. That’s why we’re going to court.”
Speaking live from the site on Fox and Friends on Friday morning, DeSantis said the facility could be ready to receive detainees by next Tuesday.
The governor has waved away any environmental threat. “I think people are just trying to say that because they just don’t want Florida assisting with the deportations. There’s a lot of people that want to have open borders. I get that. But that’s not the policy of the state. So, we’re going to do it,” he said Thursday.
Democrats question the timing of the plan
Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, a group of Florida Senate Democrats said that the DeSantis administration withheld the plan from public eye until after lawmakers left Tallahassee earlier this month upon the conclusion of their extended session.
“The announcement of the so-called Alligator Alcatraz has been timed intentionally to avoid legislative oversight,” Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith told reporters in a news conference Friday.
“It’s meant to get Trump’s attention and to distract from the Medicaid dollar-laundering scheme that found this attorney general under intense scrutiny and investigation, even from the Republican-led Florida House of Representatives,” Smith said. “It’s an attempt to distract from his contempt of court charges that he has been facing as well.”
Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman said her caucus was not aware of the plan before it was made public and its quick announcement-to-roll-out “leads me to believe that this was on the books for a much longer time period.”
The narrowly post-session announcement “leads me to believe that that was purposeful and that it was an idea that they intended to move forward with, but they didn’t want it to be done when the Legislature was in session,” Berman said.
The senators remarked on the political aspect of the facility, noting that the Republican Party of Florida is fundraising off the alliterative name, selling T-shirts and other merchandise.
“This isn’t about safety, it’s about scoring more political points by targeting immigrants and fueling fear,” Sen. Shevrin Jones said.
Berman sent a letter to Uthmeier and DeSantis Friday morning contending the plan has the potential to “constitute cruel and unusual punishment.”
“We as Democrats are looking at making Florida more affordable and not spending half a billion dollars on a prison camp in the middle of the Everglades,” Berman said.
She questioned whether DeSantis was using emergency orders in the “spirit” of what they are meant for.
Despite “being done under the guise of an emergency order. And yes, the letter of the law has been followed,” Berman acknowledged. “What is the emergency in the state of Florida, that we need to build this facility under this time frame?”
Smith called it a “dangerous escalation” that “clearly has serious environmental and human rights implications.”
“There’s no way that those temporary facilities that are intended to shelter people after a storm will be sufficient during a storm,” he said, adding that the Division of Emergency Management is involved with this operation during hurricane season.
Neither the governor’s nor attorney general’s office responded to Phoenix requests for comment relating to Democrats’ concerns in time for publication of the story.

(Courtesy of the University of Virginia)In a stunning development that’s igniting fierce political backlash, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan resigned Friday under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleged the school had failed to fully dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs — a demand tied to a sweeping federal crackdown on higher education.
The New York Times first reported Ryan’s resignation, citing DOJ claims that the institution had merely rebranded its DEI efforts instead of eliminating them. The university’s Board of Visitors accepted his resignation, with Ryan expected to officially step down by Aug. 15 after becoming the president in 2018. He has not commented publicly.
The move has sparked outrage on campus and across Virginia. A protest led by Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, is scheduled at the Rotunda on Friday.
“This unprecedented political interference threatens the independence of our University and its fundamental values,” a letter from the chairs of Wahoos4UVA Advisory Council states. “Whatever reason the Department of Justice gives for taking this action is only a pretext thinly masking a partisan agenda. What’s happening is clear: The Trump administration has made UVA the next target in its escalating attack on higher education in America.”
UVA became the first public university in Virginia to dissolve its DEI office on March 8 after President Donald Trump’s executive order warned of t federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
Opponents of DEI argue hiring and promotions should be merit-based rather than consider race or gender. Supporters say DEI efforts are vital to addressing systematic inequities that have long blocked opportunities for women and people of color and women.
The school has also been under scrutiny for its handling of antisemitism complaints. UVA was among 60 colleges flagged in a federal inquiry over whether it adequately protected Jewish students, prompting additional concerns over potential funding losses.
Virginia Senate Democrats condemned what they called federal overreach, urging university boards to “resist any efforts by the Trump Admin to dictate how Virginia runs its own taxpayer-funded schools.”



Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “UVA is the envy of American public universities,” and called Ryan an “incredible leader.” He added: “Trump’s interference in the operation of Virginia’s universities and any cooperation by those sworn to protect them will not be tolerated by the Virginia Senate.”
U.S. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also blasted the DOJ’s involvement, underscoring that Virginia’s economy and prosperity depend on the strength and integrity of the state’s higher education system.
“It is outrageous that officials in the Trump Department of Justice demanded the commonwealth’s globally recognized university remove President Ryan — a strong leader who has served UVA honorably and moved the university forward — over ridiculous ‘culture war’ traps,” the senators stated. “Decisions about UVA’s leadership belong solely to its Board of Visitors, in keeping with Virginia’s well-established and respected system of higher education governance. This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future.”
The UVA Board of Visitors last met June 4-6. Its next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 11-12.

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
 Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case

It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 20:30:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Tong confident on birthright citizenship amid Supreme Court ruling,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/william-tong-supreme-court-birthright-citizenship/,William Tong said he believes the court will declare a ban on birthright citizenship unconstitutional but fears chaos in the near term.,"A U.S Supreme Court decision Friday in a birthright citizenship case joined by Connecticut cast a shadow over the authority of federal judges who repeatedly have frustrated President Donald Trump’s executive orders with nationwide injunctions.
In a 6-3 decision, the court did not resolve the constitutionality of one of Trump’s earliest and most provocative executive orders — a denial of birthright citizenship ensconced in the Constitution and affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Instead, the court faulted district court judges who blocked the order in every state, not just in Connecticut and the other states who challenged it. 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett said, in a majority opinion praised by Trump, that the administration was likely to prevail in its claims that a nationwide or “universal injunction” exceeded the power granted to the judiciary. She acknowledged “some say” it is a check on the Executive Branch.
“But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them. When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too,” Barrett wrote.
William Tong, the attorney general of Connecticut, one of 18 states in a coalition that sued the Trump administration over the birthright order, said he was confident of the court eventually declaring the order to be unconstitutional but feared chaos in the near term.
The court left open the possibility that the ban could take effect after a 30-day period in the dozens of states that did not challenge the order.
“That’s the chaos and the uncertainty that comes from the president’s unlawful executive order,” said Tong. “This entire citizenship regime that we’ve relied on for more than 150 years, it upends it all.”
In a press conference in Hartford and on a separate Zoom call with the attorneys general of California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Washington, all states that have sued Trump to preserve birthright citizenship, Tong and his colleagues emphasized the limits of the decision.
“The court very clearly did not address the merits of birthright citizenship, and they, in fact, stayed the executive order for another 30 days for everyone. So let’s be clear, birthright citizenship remains the law of the land in states like New Jersey and in every state across the country,” said Matthew Platkin, the attorney general of New Jersey.
Tong, a Chinese-American born in Hartford to immigrant parents, calls the birthright issue personal. There is a uniquely Chinese aspect to the history of birthright citizenship, as established by the 14th Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
The full reach of the 14th Amendment was not affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court until 1898, a period of deep anti-Chinese sentiment. Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco, was denied reentry to the U.S. after a trip to China under the Chinese Exclusion Act.
“I’m here this morning, not just because I’m an attorney general and I represent the great state of Connecticut, but because I, too, am Wong Kim Ark. There are millions of Americans who share Wong Kim Ark’s story,” Tong said.
The limited decision was not unexpected, as it resulted from an emergency hearing focused on the reach of the injunctions, not the constitutionality of the president’s executive order. But the attorneys general still expressed disappointment.
“I think the Supreme Court had the opportunity to provide clarity for the entire nation, to reaffirm what has been the law of this land for over 150 years, and missed that opportunity with this order this morning,” said Nick Brown, the attorney general of Washington state. “But what the court did not do was negate any of the substantive arguments that the states made in bringing challenges to this blatantly unconstitutional executive order.”
According to the Congressional Research Service, at least 25 universal injunctions had been issued in response to executive orders issued in the first three months of the second Trump administration, challenging decisions on suspending federal spending, ending diversity programs, firing employees and other actions. 
Every president in recent decades has faced them: The CRS reported 12 nationwide injunctions were issued during the presidency of George W. Bush, 19 during Barack Obama’s presidency, and 55 during the first Trump Administration.
Tong noted that the limit on universal injunctions was doubled-edged. Trump’s allies applauded some previous ones, most notably one that limited the availability of the abortion drug, mifepristone.
“And so I think they have to tread very carefully, because what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. And if they want to go in and open up a can of worms, well, we’re going to open up a can of worms, too,” Tong said.
Tong said the decision had no immediate impact on other injunctions, but he said states that did not participate in challenges that produced universal injunction most likely appreciated them.
“Your federal funding, your NIH funding, birthright citizenship in your states, has not been cut or eliminated because Connecticut acted,” Tong said.
The three liberal justices dissented. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the injunctive authority was a vital check on executive power.
“The power to compel the Executive to follow the law is particularly vital where the relevant law is the Constitution,” she wrote. “But when the Executive violates the Constitution, the only recourse is the courts. Eliminate that check, and our government ceases to be one of ‘limited powers.’”
Trump said the decision takes away power from left-wing judges, though some of the orders had been delivered by Republican appointees.
“I was elected on a historic mandate, but in recent months, we’ve seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers. It was a grave threat to democracy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCOTUS-01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

Minnesotans lined up to pay their final respects to Hortman, who was killed on June 14 in a politically motivated assassination. Mark Hortman was also killed, and Gilbert was injured and had to be euthanized.

Melissa Hortman is the first woman in Minnesota history to lie in state at the Capitol, and the 20th Minnesotan to be awarded the honor. In the Capitol Rotunda, members of the Minnesota National Guard’s honor guard flanked the Hortmans’ wooden caskets. Photos of the couple and their dog were on display among the flowers and greenery.
Gov. Tim Walz and First Lady Gwen Walz were the first to pay their respects when the memorial opened to the public at noon. They were followed by Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, her husband and Senate Majority leader Erin Murphy.
Thousands of Minnesotans followed, many of them part of the Hortmans’ vast network of friends, family and colleagues.

Jennifer O’Rourke, director of government relations for Ramsey County, said her friendship with Melissa Hortman predates Hortman’s first election to the House in 2004.
“She deserves this,” O’Rourke said, gesturing to the line of Minnesotans wrapped around the block. Many brought flowers or letters to add to the memorial outside the House chambers, where extra tables were brought in to accommodate Friday’s contributions from the public. 
Others mourners had no connection to the Hortmans, but came in solidarity at a perilous moment in the history of the republic and its 32nd state.

Carla Peck, 69, took work off to attend the memorial alongside her 2-year-old golden retriever Ollie.
Peck didn’t know much about the Hortmans until they were killed, but she thought it important to attend.
“I wanted to show respect and appreciation for what the Hortmans did for the state of Minnesota. I thought it’s important to bring my golden because goldens are great to share the love. Dogs are very healing,” Peck said.
Dave Woosley, 65, drove over an hour from Hastings to the Capitol to pay his respects. He didn’t know Melissa Hortman, but he had heard of the extensive amount of work she was able to get done in the Legislature.
“I thought it was important for our fellow citizens to see that we can all come together, whether we agree with her or disagree with her. Just have respect for not only Melissa, but this institution,” Woosley said.

A private funeral for the Hortmans will be held at 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed.

,DC,2025-06-27 20:29:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Congress unlikely to enact ‘absolutely devastating’ Trump proposal to slash Pell Grants,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-unlikely-enact-absolutely-devastating-trump-proposal-slash-pell-grants,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump wants to cut nearly $1,700 from the maximum Pell Grant award as part of his fiscal 2026 budget request — a move that would leave the subsidy for low-income students at its lowest level in more than a decade.The proposal would have a devastating effect on college affordability and drive up costs for states because they’d have to fill in the missing federal dollars, education advocates and experts say.The request — part of the president’s wish list for appropriations in fiscal 2026 — faces steep odds in Congress, where key members of both parties responded to the proposal with alarm.“I don’t want to cut the Pell Grant,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, told States Newsroom.“I’m concerned about that — I’m hoping that we’ll get that resolved,” she said.Opposition from Capito, whose panel writes the annual bill to fund the Education Department, makes Trump’s wish unlikely to make its way into the upcoming legislation.The Pell Grant is a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college and is the foundation of federal student aid in the United States.Catherine Brown, senior policy and advocacy director at the National College Attainment Network, said the cut would be “absolutely devastating,” noting that “college is already out of reach for millions upon millions of low-income students.”Funding gapThe Pell Grant program is seeing a projected budget shortfall of $2.7 billion heading into the next fiscal year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The administration has cited the shortfall as a reason to decrease the maximum award.The request calls for reducing the maximum Pell Grant for the 2026-2027 award year from $7,395 to $5,710. The last time the maximum award stood below this level was during the 2013-2014 award year, at $5,645. Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request includes $12 billion in total cuts to the Education Department as he and his administration seek to dismantle the agency and dramatically reshape the federal role in education.Democrats: Cut would be ‘crazy’Democrats have raised strong opposition, while even the Republican chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Education Department funding was noncommittal about pursuing Pell Grant cuts.“We want to make sure that (Pell Grants are) serving the people they need to,” Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama said when asked about any concerns he has on the proposed cut.Aderholt said he’s hearing “a lot” from his constituents about the proposed reduction, and that it’s “certainly something we’re going to look at.”Meanwhile, the leading Democrats on the House and Senate education spending panels were quick to blast the proposed cut.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the full House Appropriations Committee and the education spending subcommittee, called the nearly $1,700 reduction “crazy.”“People are not going to be able to do it, and that’s the tragedy of what they’re doing here is dismantling all of the constructs that are there to provide people particularly with public education and a pathway to success,” the Connecticut Democrat said.“You take away Federal Work-Study, you lower the Pell Grant, that says to me, you want to destroy public education,” DeLauro said.The budget request proposes slashing $980 million of Federal Work-Study funding and requiring employers to pay 75% of students’ hourly wages, with the government contributing 25%.The program gives part-time employment to students with financial need in order to help cover the cost of college. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, ranking member of the Senate subcommittee, said she “strongly” opposes the proposed reduction.The Wisconsin Democrat said she also recognizes that “there’s a looming shortfall in Pell funding that we need to address.”“I am hopeful that we’ll be able to work together to do that,” Baldwin said.Advocates, experts weigh inHigher education advocates and experts are also sounding the alarm on the proposed reduction, both over the harm to low-income students’ access to higher education and the impact on states and colleges.“This would just much further exacerbate that gap and drive millions of students out of pursuing post-secondary education or set them on a different path,” Brown, with the National College Attainment Network, said.Katharine Meyer, a governance studies fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, described the proposed decline as “truly unprecedented.”She added that when the Pell Grant is smaller, states have to spend more on higher education, creating a challenge for state officials potentially grappling with other cuts in federal support in the budget reconciliation package Republicans are scrambling to pass.“States don’t necessarily have the flexibility to spend more money when they have budgets that they need to balance, and they’re facing other federal constraints, including potentially having to take on additional health care costs depending on what happens with health care negotiations in budget reconciliation,” she said.Capito also said she thought a reduction to Pell Grants would ripple out to the state level.At the institutional level, Meyer pointed out that if a state has a smaller bucket to allocate for higher education but wants to prioritize financial aid, it would “come at the cost of” the money appropriated to universities.“Then institutions are not going to be able to spend as much on their operating funds,” she said. “They’re not going to be able to do capital improvement campaigns, which are often very necessary.”Ties to reconciliation billHouse Republicans have also proposed major changes to Pell Grant eligibility as part of GOP lawmakers’ separate “big, beautiful bill.” The legislative package would slash billions of dollars in federal programs to offset the cost of other parts of Trump’s agenda, including extending the 2017 tax cuts and boosting border security funding.GOP lawmakers are using the complex reconciliation process to move a package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber and avoid the Senate’s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship.The House narrowly passed its version of the reconciliation package in late May. That measure included a provision that would raise the minimum number of credit hours to qualify for the maximum Pell Grant award from 12 per semester to 15. The move would save $7.1 billion in federal spending over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.That new eligibility requirement is not included in the draft proposal for the reconciliation package that Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released in June.",,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)While the U.S. Senate has taken the front seat on discussing the GOP’s massive tax-and-spending bill, members of Congress’ lower chamber continue to weigh in on specific measures that could make passage through the U.S. House difficult.
Specifically, several U.S. Representatives have drawn a line against any provisions that would sell off federal public lands — a similar coalition that stripped a smaller land sale provision from the One Big Beautiful Bill during its first vetting by the House.
In a letter sent to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, five representatives, led by Montana western Rep. Ryan Zinke, called public land sales a “poison pill,” and if the bill returns to the House with a provision for selling federal land, the legislation will not pass muster.
“We support the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) passed by the House and generally accept changes to the bill that may be made by the Senate,” Thursday’s letter states. “However, we cannot accept the sale of federal lands that Senator Lee seeks. If a provision to sell public lands is in the bill that reaches the House floor, we will be forced to vote no.”
Republicans hold a slim eight-seat margin in the chamber — three Democratic representatives have died this year leaving vacancies — and if all Democrats were to oppose the bill, a five-representative block of Republicans voting against it would sink the reconciliation legislation, which needs a simple majority to pass.
When the bill first passed through the House, Zinke worked to strip out an amendment that proposed the sale of thousands of acres of federal land near urban areas in Nevada and Utah.
But once in the Senate, public land sales have become an even bigger debate after Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee introduced a new provision targeting the mandatory sale of between 2 million and 3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land. While federal land in Montana was exempt from the provision, it drew opposition from myriad outdoor recreation and conservation groups as well as from several Republican senators, including Montana’s Steve Daines and Idaho’s Jim Risch and Mike Crapo.
On Monday, the Senate parliamentarian — the nonpartisan advisor to the Senate who interprets rules — ruled that the public lands sale does not meet the requirements for inclusion in a reconciliation bill.
But within hours, Lee had stated he will work on smaller proposal targeting just BLM land within five miles of a population center, aimed at reducing housing costs in regions across the West, to be included in the legislative package.
In an interview with CNN that Zinke posted to the social media site X, formerly Twitter, he disagreed with the premise that vast swaths of public land should be sold to be used for affordable housing.
“Affordable housing is tens of acres, not millions of acres,” he said in the interview.
The letter sent by Zinke and representatives from Idaho, Oregon, Washington and California, said that there are “deep concerns” about Lee’s push to sell off public lands.
“This would be a grave mistake, unforced error and poison pill that will cause the bill to fail should it come to the House floor,” the letter states.
The elected officials all represent western states with vast tracts of federal land — 52% in Oregon, 46% in California and a whopping 80% in Montana’s western House district.
“We understand and agree with Senator Lee and our House colleagues that the federal government has mismanaged federal lands for decades, however, we do not agree with their solution. We believe advancing the House Republicans legislative agenda on public lands and natural resources, along with using existing law for land disposals, is the correct path forward,” the letter said.
The representatives say they hope the Senate parliamentarian will strip out any additional language about public lands sales from the bill.
Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Foundation, said the coalition of conservation groups he works with are continuing to provide a “positive stream of encouragement,” to Montana’s federal delegation urging them to keep up their record of opposition to public land sales.
“A threat to public land anywhere, is a threat to public land everywhere,” Szollosi told the Daily Montanan. “We’re all public land owners regardless of what state they’re in.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5418-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

The department launched NeverForgotten.ar.gov in 2016 in partnership with the state attorney general’s office. The database will now “automatically capture” a missing person report to the National Crime Information Center by local law enforcement agencies, according to the news release. The report will alert both the Arkansas State Police and the U.S. Marshals Service.
“These enhancements will help law enforcement respond more quickly, particularly in cases involving juveniles who may be at risk of being trafficked,” the news release states.
Real-time updates eliminate the previously existing lag in accurate information caused by weekly updates, according to the Department of Public Safety.
“These enhancements will improve the effectiveness of missing person investigations and public awareness campaigns, increasing the chances of safe recovery — particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and at-risk adults,” ACIC Deputy Director Rick Stallings said in the release.
Arkansas has more than 400 unsolved cases of missing persons between 1 and 91 years old. A case from 30 years ago, the abduction of 6-year-old Morgan Nick of Alma, remained “active and ongoing” as of October, when the Alma Police Department announced it had uncovered new DNA evidence linking Nick to her suspected kidnapper, who died in prison in 1996.
The Morgan Nick Foundation, a missing children’s advocacy group founded by Nick’s mother, is one of the groups that actively supports the Arkansas Department of Public Safety’s efforts to solve missing persons cases, according to Friday’s news release.

Both faced a jury trial in Saginaw County Circuit Court. Following deliberations, the jury convicted Eggleston and Lamar-Silvia on one count of conspiracy to do a legal act in an illegal manner and one count of election law forgery, both five-year felonies. 
Eggleston was additionally convicted of a 93-day misdemeanor for signing a nominating petition as a circulator, even though he was a candidate for office.
Lamar-Silvia was also convicted on one count of signing multiple different names on a nominating petition, a five-year felony, and one count of signing a nominating petition with a name other than her own, a 93-day misdemeanor.
The Michigan Department of Attorney General alleged that Lamar-Silvia fraudulently signed the names of Saginaw voters to help get Eggleston on the ballot in 2024. It was also alleged that Eggleston signed a form falsely saying he was a petition circulator. He then submitted the documents to the Saginaw County Clerk’s office.
“Forging signatures on nominating petitions undermines our democratic process,” Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. “I am pleased the jury recognized the seriousness of these offenses. These convictions serve as a strong reminder that no one is above the law, and my office remains committed to upholding our election laws to protect the will of voters.”
Eggleston and Lamar-Silvia are to be sentenced in August before Saginaw County Circuit Court Judge Andre Borrello.

(Screenshot)OKLAHOMA CITY — Cuts to Medicaid being considered by Congress will affect access to health care for “all Oklahomans” and harm the state economy, state hospital leaders warned Friday. 
Members of the Oklahoma Hospital Association said the proposed federal cuts to Medicaid could eliminate nearly 15,000 jobs and over the next decade reduce federal reimbursements to Oklahoma hospitals by $8.7 billion. 
“This is happening at such a breakneck speed,” said Denise Webber, president and CEO of Stillwater Medical. “There’s not ample time to plan and create a strategy that can serve Oklahomans and U.S. citizens in a manner that we can plan for.”
Cuts to Medicaid as part of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” are being considered in the U.S. Senate as part of Congress’ budget reconciliation process. The bill passed through the House, but has faced resistance in the Senate due in part to concerns about its expected negative impact on rural hospitals. Also the chamber’s parliamentarian ruled several proposed Medicaid changes can’t proceed. Senate leaders hope to vote on the bill before July 4. 
Webber said the proposed Medicaid cuts are unlike anything she’s seen in modern history. She chairs the Oklahoma Hospital Association board. “Big cuts” will have to be made for hospitals to be able to provide some services, she said. The Oklahoma Hospital Association advocates at state and federal levels on behalf of hospitals and works to promote health policy issues. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIf cuts are made because hospitals can no longer afford staff, it doesn’t only affect Medicaid patients but all Oklahomans seeking care, Webber said. 
“If we don’t have enough nurses and hospital beds and we have to put in (patient) caps, that can mean that you’ll be held kind of in a limbo land, waiting for a hospital bed,” Webber said. “And then what potentially happens, because this is happening statewide and nationwide, is we may not even understand, because I don’t believe we do, how bad that could get.”
The most expensive services, like oncology and neonatal, are likely to be cut first, she said. 
Rich Rasmussen, president and CEO of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said the hospital group has spent time in D.C. advocating directly to Oklahoma’s congressional delegation and their staff, warning them of the potential effects of these cuts. 
If the bill were to pass and immediately affect the existing reimbursement models beginning this summer and fall, hospital boards will need to “wrestle” with the reductions, he said. 
“I think it’s something that nobody looks forward to,” Rasmussen said. “So hopefully our senators will stand in the gap for us and ensure that we aren’t hit with these types of cuts.”
Ten hospitals in Oklahoma have closed since 2005, he said. But more hospital closures, especially in rural Oklahoma, could be looming if the Senate approves the Medicaid cuts. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stilwell Hospital announced its closure this month, raising concerns about rural health care access.
Rural Oklahomans are already faced with worse health care outcomes and provider deserts, but these will be exacerbated by Medicaid cuts, said Trent Bourland, vice president of rural development for SSM Health Oklahoma. 
“The lack of analytical depth in evaluating the full effect on the rural providers represents a serious oversight in responsible governments,” he said. “Our rural communities are the backbone of our nation. They deserve policy decisions guided by solid data, practical foresight and respect for the role in what rural America does for sustaining America’s strength and stability.”
People in rural areas will have to travel further for care, especially OB-GYN care, Bourland said. 
In the 15 most Northwest Oklahoma counties, obstetrics care would most likely be eliminated, he said. This would force people to drive over 40 miles for routine care and up to 80 miles for specialty care, Bourland said, but only if other regional hospitals are still able to provide those services. 
Jay Johnson, president and CEO of DRH Health in Duncan, said the hospital will have to put a hold on its efforts to expand OB-GYN and mental health care and potentially eliminate travel nurse contracts. 
“We’ll often get into these conversations of rural and urban, but there’s not much of a rural and urban in health care anymore because we’re all in this together,” Johnson said. “And that’s what it takes to provide care for our patients throughout our state.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-27-at-12.50.43 PM-e1751053587458-1024x791.png,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

Kelly Ayotte signed New Hampshire’s two budget bills — House Bill 1 and House Bill 2 — into law Friday, approving a $15.9 billion two-year package to fund the state government until July 2027.
The governor also signed a third compromise bill, House Bill 282, meant to address her concerns over education funding and changes to the retirement system, and to head off her threats of a veto.
The signatures mark a political victory for the governor, when the outcome was hardly certain. Just one week after House and Senate negotiators made reductions to health care spending, education aid to Manchester school districts, and a proposed fix to police and firefighter retirement benefits championed by Ayotte, the governor had vowed to veto the budget without changes. 
That pledge kicked off days of negotiations that culminated in a last-minute deal Wednesday evening that Ayotte endorsed. But a faction of fiscally conservative House Republicans who objected to spending increases nearly derailed the process, joining with Democrats to briefly defeat HB 1 on Thursday before the vote was reconsidered and the bill was passed.
In the end, after months of sharp disagreements among the Republican governor, the House, and the Senate over how much the state could afford, Ayotte emerged with a budget that kept much of the funding she proposed in February. 
The final package signed Friday restored many of the cuts made to Ayotte’s budget by the House, which took a more conservative approach. Some boards and agencies that had been eliminated by the House, like the Office of the Child Advocate, the Commission for Human Rights, and the Housing Appeals Board, were restored in the budget, albeit with some changes and cuts. The budget also includes some policies championed by Ayotte, such as a “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban in public schools and a new requirement that state agencies turn around housing development applications in 60 days. 
But the final spending package also adds cuts to the University System of New Hampshire not favored by Ayotte, and does not include the high revenue projections as Ayotte’s budget did. And it inserted a series of “back-of-the budget” cuts to agencies, such as a $51 million cut to the Department of Health and Human Services, that will require commissioners to reduce programs and potentially eliminate positions. 
Republicans broadly praised the budget for keeping spending increases within inflation, allowing education freedom accounts to apply to all income levels, and including some policy priorities such as the end of the state vehicle inspections beginning January 2026.
Democrats, meanwhile, decried the budget’s cuts to DHHS spending and its creation of a new premium added to Medicaid plans for participants, and said the budget underfunds efforts to improve housing affordability, child care, and public education.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ayotteinaugural-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

There will be Michiganders that don’t survive the cuts if Congress passes the plan, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, General Motors employee and United Autos Worker member Jean Duchemin said during the event on the Capitol lawn.
In total, the legislation, which has already been voted through by the U.S. House and now awaits the U.S. Senate’s approval, would cut Medicaid funding by more than $800 billion and cut about $290 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
The GOP bill seeks to extend the 2017 tax cuts made during Trump’s first term, as well as vastly shrink the size of the federal government through major spending reductions.

Duchemin said while Trump’s plan looks to line the pockets of the billionaire class while breaking the middle class, the working class has power too, noting the UAW’s track record of fighting for better wages. In 2023, the UAW led a successful strike against Detroit’s “Big Three” automakers in order to secure better benefits and pay for autoworkers.
“This is class warfare…It always has been class warfare. It’s an attack on the poor, it’s an attack on the middle class, and its attack on the working class. So when you see a protest, when you see a gathering fighting for these rights, join them. If you have a voice, use it,” Duchemin said. “Keep shaking the foundations of these billionaires’ mansions, because they are afraid of us. They are terrified of us.”

Lansing was the latest stop for the “Stop the Billionaire Giveaway” Bus Tour, led by Fair Share America, where for the next few weeks advocates against the spending plan are traveling with a green bus to different states to call for an end to the Republican plan.
The budget bill has made progress to becoming law, but it isn’t too late to fight against it, Executive Director of Fair Share America Kristen Crowell said. And as the Senate makes changes to the bill, she said it will have to go through the House again.
A recent ruling by the Senate parliamentarian has complicated GOP plans to move the legislation to a floor vote. 
Regardless, Crowell said hardworking people often find themselves on the cusp of poverty, and all it takes is one bill to send a family into catastrophe.
“One dental bill sent my family into a downward spiral that felt impossible to recover from. First, my lights were turned off and the electricity was shut. Then they repossessed my car, and ultimately I lost my home to foreclosure,” Crowell said. “The fear that this puts on a family and on children, is unthinkable, but there’s also great shame in not being able to take care of our families and take care of our loved ones.”

There’s a misconception that only certain types of people rely on Medicaid, and if Michiganders are under the impression that no one they know is on Medicaid, they are mistaken, Steve Lawson, executive director for Michigan Families for Fair Care said during the Friday event.
There are about 2.6 million Michiganders who are enrolled in Medicaid, about a quarter of the state’s population, according to the state health department. Meanwhile, about 15% of Michigan’s population, nearly 1.5 million residents, rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the Michigan State Budget Office.
“Michigan is a middle class state. We work hard here. We look out for our neighbors. We’re proud of where we came from. We always think about the people who are doing less well than we are,” Lawson said. “Cutting Medicaid to pay for tax breaks for billionaires are not Michigan values.”

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Lee’s Montana newspapers include The Billings Gazette, Missoulian, the Montana Standard, Helena Independent Record and the Ravalli Republic.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
  Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case 

It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Failed contract negotiations between Brown University Health and UnitedHealthcare mean that thousands of seniors and disabled residents will no longer be covered for non-emergency visits at four Rhode Island hospitals starting July 1.
Fallout from the closed-door dispute has spilled over into public communications, creating uncertainty for United Medicare Advantage plan participants over whether they can keep seeing Brown Health hospital physicians at the same cost even after the contract expires on Monday, June 30.
Brown Health on a webpage dedicated to the contract issue states that its hospitals — Rhode Island Hospital, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Newport Hospital — will be considered “out of network” for United Medicare Advantage patients. This would suggest that affected plan participants will have to pay out of pocket to keep seeing their same doctors, or even lose the chance to continue receiving non-emergency services.
But United on its own webpage calls out Brown Health for “inaccurate information” regarding the timing of loss of coverage. According to the health insurer, Brown Health physicians will remain “in network” for Medicare Advantage patients on, and after July 1.
Jessica Wharton, a spokesperson for Brown Health, clarified in an emailed response Friday that hospital physicians will continue to participate in United’s Medicare Advantage plan through June 2026. However, out-of-pocket costs may rise for patients no longer in the network, depending on their plans, she said. 
Amid confusion and a flood of questions to his office, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has stepped in with a webpage of his own. 
“Any sudden change in health insurance coverage can cause consumers to panic, and rightfully so,” Neronha said in a statement. “Affordable, accessible health care is foundational to our quality of life, and we hope this resource equips Rhode Islanders with the information they need, should they need it.”
Information on the number of inquiries from affected patients to Neronha’s office was not immediately available.
The AG’s website also addresses the question of whether UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage patients can keep seeing their Brown Health hospital doctors after July 1.
The answer, per the AG’s website: “It depends on your plan and your particular medical needs. You may need to pay more for care at Brown University Health hospitals if a contract is not agreed to, but you may still have some coverage for care provided at these facilities.”
The AG website refers readers to UnitedHealthcare’s website and phone number for more information on what’s covered under their individual insurance plans.

Negotiations break down over payments 
Confusion over when coverage ends for affected participants tracks with the conflicting narratives each side gives. As United tells it, the hospital network made a “good-faith effort,” to agree on new contract terms with Brown Health ahead of the June 30 expiration.
“Unfortunately, Brown University Health refused our proposal to extend our contract through the end of 2025 and is seeking to be paid significantly more than any health system in our Medicare Advantage network in Rhode Island,” the company states on its website. 
United also said it offered to extend the existing Medicare Advantage contract through the end of 2025 as a stopgap until a longer-term agreement was worked out. Brown Health refused, “potentially and unnecessarily disrupting access to care for thousands of people enrolled in our Medicare Advantage plans,” the company states on its website.
Cole Manbeck, a spokesperson for United, did not directly answer questions about the miscommunication or how many plan participants will lose coverage at Brown Health hospitals. 
“While we remain open to discussions with Brown University Health, our focus at this time is providing people access to the care they need through continuity of care or a smooth transition to another provider, as appropriate,” Manbeck said in an emailed statement Friday. 
Brown Health maintains that the decision not to renew the contract was “mutual.” The hospital system said it wanted “fair reimbursement” and “less administrative burden for patients.”
Wharton pointed out that United offers higher reimbursements for the hospital network at its two Massachusetts hospitals than in Rhode Island, echoing the well-documented problem of the Ocean State’s uncompetitive reimbursement rates. The contract dispute does not apply to Brown Health’s Morton Hospital in Taunton or St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River.
Federally reported data estimates 129,000 Rhode Islanders are enrolled in Medicare Advantage health insurance plans available for people 65 and older, or with disabilities or chronic conditions like end-stage kidney failure or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.) The commercial alternative to government-run traditional Medicare has grown in popularity nationwide and in Rhode Island with the promise of additional benefits and cost savings to participants. Participation in United’s Medicare Advantage program in Rhode Island grew 10.1% in 2023, according to the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner’s (OHIC) 2025 annual report.
But, private providers have faced increased scrutiny for inflating testing and diagnostics as a means to increase their bottom lines. 
Research by the Center for Advancing Health Policy Through Research at the Brown University School of Public Health suggests Medicare Advantage plans are projected to receive $30 billion in additional payments this year as a result of “differential coding intensity” compared with traditional, government-run Medicare plans.
UnitedHealth Group Inc, the parent company for the insurer’s individual state plans, topped the list of private insurers raking in money through inflated risk assessments, spending an extra $11.6 million across its 6.9 million plan participants nationwide in 2025, according to the analysis, which is based on 2021 Medicare data adjusted to 2025 dollars. In Rhode Island, the insurer is projected to spend an extra $47 million due to higher risk assessments of its 37,000 plan participants this year, or $105 more per patient, on average. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which covers nearly twice the number of Medicare Advantage patients in the state as United, was projected to spend an extra $1 more per patient compared with traditional Medicare plan spending.
Both private insurers’ Medicare Advantage plans exceeded the state’s 6% cost growth target in 2023, with Blue Cross reporting 7.1% increase in total spending, while United’s total costs rose 14.8%, according to OHIC’s annual report. 
The end to the contract between Brown Health and United does not affect dual Medicare and Medicaid recipients. There are also assurances for continuity of care in certain cases, including patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed cancer, or those in active cancer treatment. United Medicare Advantage plan participants whose insurance is covered through a former employer under a group plan may also continue to receive care at Brown University hospitals.

The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County, Maryland, parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)State lawmakers this week emphasized to court officials that New Mexico’s behavioral health overhaul must not result in pulling more people into the criminal legal system.
New Mexico this year enacted two pieces of legislation intended to rebuild the system for delivering mental health treatment in the state after former Gov. Susana Martinez dismantled it more than a decade ago.
The new laws’ intent includes allowing local communities, including governments and non-governmental organizations, to organize into “behavioral health regions;” determine what services and supports they need; and then present those priorities to the newly created Behavioral Health Reform Executive Committee for approval and funding.
At its first meeting on Tuesday, the Executive Committee voted to establish the regions, Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) Director Karl Reifsteck said at the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee meeting on Wednesday.
AOC Behavioral Health Integration and Reform Administrator Esperanza Lucero told the committee that the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is helping AOC with Sequential Intercept Mapping, which is a commonly used conceptual model that maps out “intercept” points where people with mental health or substance use disorders can receive treatment and support.
When Reifsteck and Lucero presented an example of what the model could look like on Wednesday, lawmakers questioned them about why so much of it is focused on police, courts, jail and prison.
Members of the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee from both political parties on Wednesday told AOC officials they intended the behavioral health treatment reforms to benefit all people with mental health diagnoses, not just people who come into contact with police or the courts.
LHHS Committee Chair Liz Thomson, a Democratic representative from Albuquerque, said concerns have been raised to her about the new system having “a criminal basis, as opposed to just behavioral health.” She asked if AOC has figured out how to implement the new law without relying on the criminal legal system.
Lucero pointed to the first step in the model that calls for a “crisis line,” which generally refers to phone lines that offer free counseling for people dealing with emotional, mental or substance use issues. The state Health Care Authority’s 988 NM Lifeline offers support via phone, text, live chat or video call.
However, Thomson and other lawmakers on the committee said people need access to more than just a helpline when they start seeking help, before police, prosecutors and judges get involved.
“We want treatment before there’s a crisis,” Thomson said. “I’m bringing it out because I’m part of the disability community and it’s a concern, and we really, really don’t want the public to come away with the impression that a behavioral health disorder issue is criminal.”
Sen. Jay Block, a Rio Rancho Republican, said the law’s intent “is not judicial or criminal by any means.”
“We have an epidemic in this country of some behavioral health issues — especially in this state — and the intent of this is to provide empirical data to allow us to understand where we need to focus our resources, where we need to invest more resources or pull back resources to get these people the help that they need,” Block said.
AOC Deputy Director Sarah Jacobs said her agency is working with UNM’s Health Sciences Center on a model that would involve less interaction with the criminal legal system.
Reifsteck said the new law gives the behavioral health regions and local stakeholders the power to determine their local priorities. “It’s not going to be the courts deciding on what the priorities are,” he said.
Thomson asked if the Executive Committee has veto power in the event one of the regions submits a plan “that’s all about hardened criminals, with nothing for families, nothing for infants and children.”
“Is there some sort of oversight saying, ‘Whoa, this isn’t quite what we had in mind’?” she asked.
Reifsteck said yes, because the new law explicitly makes the Executive Committee responsible for reviewing and approving the plans.
“So I would anticipate that if a region came in and set a plan, and it was purely criminal justice focused, the seven members would say, ‘Hold on, why are these the top priorities for your region’?” he said. “Maybe that’s what is possible right now, or something, for that region, but it’s hard to imagine that those are the only ones.”
Lucero said the Executive Committee expects the local regions to submit plans by July 2026.
The Executive Committee’s next meeting is scheduled for Aug. 5, at which time Reifsteck said he hopes to see a rubric or initial thoughts from the Health Care Authority about how the regions should be organized.

Supreme Court case shakes Idaho ski areas by overturning decades of liability precedent

However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed.

“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.”
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.
Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident
Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions.
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say
The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments to reconsider ruling on ski area liability law

Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails.
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas.
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling:

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others.
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.
In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas.
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

(Courtesy of the University of Virginia)In a stunning development that’s igniting fierce political backlash, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan resigned Friday under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which alleged the school had failed to fully dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs — a demand tied to a sweeping federal crackdown on higher education.
The New York Times first reported Ryan’s resignation, citing DOJ claims that the institution had merely rebranded its DEI efforts instead of eliminating them. The university’s Board of Visitors accepted his resignation, with Ryan expected to officially step down by Aug. 15 after becoming the president in 2018. He has not commented publicly.
The move has sparked outrage on campus and across Virginia. A protest led by Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, is scheduled at the Rotunda on Friday.
“This unprecedented political interference threatens the independence of our University and its fundamental values,” a letter from the chairs of Wahoos4UVA Advisory Council states. 
“Whatever reason the Department of Justice gives for taking this action is only a pretext thinly masking a partisan agenda. What’s happening is clear: the Trump administration has made UVA the next target in its escalating attack on higher education in America.”
UVA became the first public university in Virginia to dissolve its DEI office on March 8 after President Donald Trump’s executive order warned of t federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
Opponents of DEI argue hiring and promotions should be merit-based rather than consider race or gender. Supporters say DEI efforts are vital to addressing systematic inequities that have long blocked opportunities for women and people of color and women.
The school has also been under scrutiny for its handling of antisemitism complaints. UVA was among 60 colleges flagged in a federal inquiry over whether it adequately protected Jewish students, prompting additional concerns over potential funding losses.
Virginia Senate Democrats condemned what they called federal overreach, urging university boards to “resist any efforts by the Trump Admin to dictate how Virginia runs its own taxpayer-funded schools.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “UVA is the envy of American public universities,” and called Ryan an “incredible leader.” He added: “Trump’s interference in the operation of Virginia’s universities and any cooperation by those sworn to protect them will not be tolerated by the Virginia Senate.”
U.S. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also blasted the DOJ’s involvement, underscoring that Virginia’s economy and prosperity depend on the strength and integrity of the state’s higher education system. 
“It is outrageous that officials in the Trump Department of Justice demanded the commonwealth’s globally recognized university remove President Ryan — a strong leader who has served UVA honorably and moved the university forward — over ridiculous ‘culture war’ traps,” the senators stated. 
“Decisions about UVA’s leadership belong solely to its Board of Visitors, in keeping with Virginia’s well-established and respected system of higher education governance. This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future.”
The UVA Board of Visitors last met June 4-6. Its next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 11-12.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)With the U.S. Senate poised to vote on a budget reconciliation bill that, among other impacts, will slash health care for thousands of Mainers, advocates are putting pressure on Republican Sen. Susan Collins to buck her caucus and vote against the plan.
GOP leaders have set a deadline of July 4 for passage and the Senate is expected to vote on the bill over the weekend.
For the past two weeks, health care advocates in Maine and beyond have been calling on Collins to reject the bill, which proposes significant cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other programs in order to continue tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. 
Almost 400,000 Maine residents — a third of the state’s population — currently rely on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. The nonpartisan budget office estimates as many as 50,000 Mainers could lose health coverage by 2034, either under Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, while the restrictions in funding will further increase the strain on rural hospitals.
“As the chair of the Appropriations Committee and the seventh most senior U.S. senator, Sen. Susan Collins holds immense power. But she’s not using it to publicly stand against the reconciliation bill,” said Nora Flaherty-Stanford, communications director for the Maine People’s Alliance, which held protests earlier this month outside Collins’ offices in Bangor, Lewiston and Portland. “If this bill moves forward in its current form, it will badly hurt Mainers and people around the country.”
On Thursday, Gov. Janet Mills sent a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation, urging them to vote against the bill. Citing an independent estimate that found Maine could lose $4.5 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade, Mills warned that Maine can’t bear the financial burden the health care and other cuts would impose on the state. 
Both Democratic Reps. Jared Golden and Chellie Pingree voted against the reconciliation bill when the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version last month. If the Senate passes its version, the bill will go back to the House to vote on those changes. 
On Monday, independent Sen. Angus King led a group of former governors in sending a letter to Republican leadership highlighting their concerns with how the proposal will impact state budgets. In a press conference Wednesday, King called the bill “the worst, most regressive and most harmful piece of legislation I have ever seen.” 
Collins has not publicly said how she plans to vote on the reconciliation bill and her office did not respond to requests for comment.
During Senate negotiations, Collins described some of the proposed cuts to Medicaid as “problematic,” but has said she supports adding work requirements to the health program. 
The work requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill. Flaherty-Stanford and other advocates say the paperwork mandates will cause eligible people to lose care.
“Most of the people who will lose their coverage won’t lose it because they aren’t eligible,” Flaherty-Stanford said. “They’ll lose it by getting buried under mountains of red tape and relentless bureaucratic requirements.”

Health professionals argue against Medicaid cuts
Senate Republicans can only lose three of their members and still pass the bill. With such a small margin for success, Trump has been pressuring those who have been critical of the proposal to get on board. “We don’t want to have grandstanders,” Trump said Thursday. “Not good people. They know who I’m talking about.”
During a press conference Friday, State Rep. Anne Graham (D-North Yarmouth) and Protect Our Care Maine Director Toby McGrath acknowledged that pressure coming from the White House but called on Collins to do what is best for Maine.
“I just want Susan Collins to listen to her constituents and stand up for her constituents and not be bullied by the Republican majority or the administration,” said Graham, a retired pediatric nurse practitioner. “One of the things that she’s always been proud of is representing the northern part of Maine, the rural parts of Maine. Those are the people who are going to suffer the most, I believe, if these cuts happen.”
In Maine, 24.1% of people in rural areas or small towns rely on Medicaid, compared with 20% of people in metro areas, according to a study by Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. The state also has the 11th highest rate of Medicaid coverage for adults aged 19 to 64 in rural areas in the country, including people with disabilities, and the 9th highest rate of coverage for seniors.
Dr. Christine Mahoney, a physician from Brunswick, joined more than 4,000 doctors nationwide in signing a letter organized by the Committee to Protect Health Care urging senators to vote against the bill. 
“I see firsthand how access to health care improves health and saves lives, and for many, many Mainers, Medicaid is that lifeline,” Mahoney said during a separate press event earlier this week.
Without Medicaid, prevention and management of chronic conditions and maternal care would be severely threatened, she said. She noted that without coverage, patients often delay medical treatment, leading to late-stage preventable diseases and potentially forcing difficult choices between health care and financial survival.
Mahoney also highlighted broader community impacts, including potential hospital closures and economic disruption, particularly in rural areas. 
If Maine’s members of Congress vote in favor of the bill, “the message it sends to me and a lot of Mainers would be that our senators don’t care. That they don’t care about them, they don’t care about their futures, they don’t care about their health and livelihood,” Mahoney added.
Family planning providers warn about ‘backdoor abortion ban’
Maine’s family planning providers, Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, echoed the calls for senators to vote against the bill during a press event on Tuesday.
One provision of the bill still being weighed by the Senate parliamentarian, which determines whether the bill adheres to the complex rules of the reconciliation process, would bar Medicaid reimbursements to organizations that provide abortions and receive more than $1 million in federal funds.
Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, described the budget reconciliation bill as “a backdoor abortion ban.”
“Every single day we are having to navigate a new policy or push from the federal government, something that’s being taken away, all in an attempt to put us out of business, to stop us from providing abortion,” she said. 
In May, Planned Parenthood released a memo pointing to Collins’ long history of supporting the organization. “Throughout her career, Sen. Collins has made it clear that she understands how critical Medicaid is to her constituents and all Americans’ ability to access essential health care,” it read. “She knows that cuts to the program will harm Mainers.”
Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, told the Maine Morning Star that it’s clear the bill will hurt Maine, and “we are counting on our congressional delegation to do everything they can to stop it from getting to President Trump’s desk.”

Connecticut’s Democratic congressional delegation wasn’t so sure.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, for example, claimed Trump was “deliberately misleading the public” when he said Iran’s nuclear program was “completely and totally obliterated.” Murphy believes the attack only set it back “by a handful of months” and not years if Iran still possesses enriched uranium.
“There’s no doubt there was damage done to the program, but the allegations that we have obliterated their program just don’t seem to stand up to reason,” Murphy told reporters Thursday at the U.S. Capitol. “I can’t share any of the details from this briefing, but I just do not think the president was telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated.”
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said it was too early to tell the extent of the damage and believes Iran is still a threat. But he agreed with Murphy to an extent that descriptions appeared “to exaggerate the amount of damage and how long it would take to rebuild.”
Both senators hope for a diplomatic solution but said that depends on the administration’s next steps. 
The two delayed classified briefings at the U.S. Capitol — one before the Senate on Thursday, one before the House today — highlighted the latest tensions between the parties over the strikes in Iran as well as how they view their roles in approving military action.
The Trump administration has strongly defended the strikes. At a briefing from the Pentagon on Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called it a “resounding success.” He lashed out at the press over stories on a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report that concluded core components of the nuclear component — like some of the centrifuges that enrich uranium — remain intact and the strikes only set it back a few months.
“Because you cheer against Trump so hard, in your DNA and in your blood, cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad, you have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon briefing. “You have to hope maybe they weren’t effective.”

Republicans were largely in agreement with Trump’s assessment of obliteration. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said he believed the strikes caused “catastrophic damage.”
As he left the highly secure room where the briefing was held, Blumenthal told reporters he was “hopeful we did as much damage as possible” and called the mission “successful insofar extensively damaged and set back the Iranian arms program.” But he cautioned that he wants to wait and see what final reports indicate.
“We have a lot of spin, a lot of narrative that seems to exaggerate the amount of damage and how long it would take to rebuild, and that’s dangerous because it creates a false sense of security,” Blumenthal said in an interview after Thursday’s briefing. “I came away from that briefing without a lot of comfort that we have completely and finally stopped a nuclear-armed Iran.”
“The point is we don’t know. Anybody who says we know a certain thing is making it up because we have no final battle damage assessment,” he told reporters at another point after the briefing.
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said there has been a lot of recent discussion over “what’s the right adjective” to describe the strikes.
Courtney commended U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, for his questions during Friday’s House briefing, adding it was “helpful to get the discussion off of political messaging and into the meat of the issues.” Himes serves as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and had voiced concerns about not getting advance notice about the strikes, given the role of the committee on intelligence matters.
Courtney said he he got some information but some questions still remain. For the eastern Connecticut congressman, his biggest focus is on the end game and force protection.
But he described Friday’s briefing as well-attended and said lawmakers in both parties were listening: “You could have heard a pin drop.”
“There was no question that both the Air Force and the submarine force executed the mission with great impact,” Courtney said, noting the Ohio-class submarine built in Groton that launched Tomahawk missiles into Iran. “But there’s definitely going to be more meat on the bone in terms of follow-up analysis and also diplomacy.”
The briefings were initially planned for earlier in the week but were postponed, to the frustration of the delegation. Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine attended the briefings.
But Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was notably absent. She testified in March that the U.S. intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.” Murphy said he wanted to know why she wasn’t in the room for a classified intelligence briefing.
Democrats and a handful of Republicans were frustrated that the administration didn’t seek approval or input from Congress before the bombings. Republicans and the administration believe Trump had the authority to authorize the strike on his own. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pointed to presidents in both parties who have relied on Article II of the Constitution as giving them that authority to do so as the commander-in-chief.
In response, Democrats have been pushing for votes on war powers resolutions to reassert their congressional authority on military action. One from U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is scheduled for a vote later on Friday.
Himes has his own resolution, which he introduced alongside other national security leaders U.S. Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Adam Smith, D-Wash. It is similar to another war powers resolution in the House but has a key distinction: It directs Trump to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran “other than those elements of the Armed Forces that may be necessary to defend the United States or an ally or partner of the United States from imminent attack provided.”
The Constitution grants the legislative branch the ability to “declare war.” The War Powers Act of 1973 requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action if there is no declaration of war.
Johnson has been critical of war powers resolutions, saying that it “is not a time for politics” and has called the War Powers Act “unconstitutional.”
As they await more answers on the strikes and push for additional briefings, Connecticut lawmakers are hoping to see the president engage in a diplomatic agreement to stabilizing the region, particularly as there’s a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. 
“The only path forward is diplomacy,” Murphy said, with a caveat. “I just have not heard a realistic path from this administration about diplomacy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25173450855675-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 16:06:37.190861

Indiana’s law has been in effect but a judge had stayed an ongoing lawsuit until the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling in the Texas lawsuit. On Friday, the court sided with Texas in a 6-3 vote along ideological lines. 
Attorney general, adult websites clash in age verification lawsuit

“(The Texas law) simply requires proof of age to access content that is obscene to minors, it does not directly regulate adults’ protected speech,” ruled the majority. “… adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification. Any burden on adults is therefore incidental to regulating activity not protected by the First Amendment.”
The court similarly dismissed arguments from adult content creators urging states to adopt less restrictive requirements, with the justices saying that isn’t required. 
While all agreed that states have an interest in protecting children from explicit material, dissenting justices said that “… adults have a constitutional right to view the very same speech that a State may prohibit for children.” 
Friday’s ruling was a departure from precedent, the dissenting justices argued, pointing to the option for less-restrictive laws. 
“… a State cannot target that expressions, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children,” the dissent said.
 Indiana background

Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act 17 passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority that would require the adult pornography sites to verify user ages early in the 2024 session. Prior to the law taking effect in July, a federal judge blocked its enforcement — only for an appeals court to roll back the preliminary injunction in August. 
The plaintiffs include the Free Speech Coalition and 11 adult content companies, including major provider Pornhub. 
Pornhub has blocked access to the site in Indiana since the law went into effect.
Free speech advocates, including those with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, argued that the barrier would make it harder for adult Hoosiers to access the content, which is their protected right under law. 
“The First Amendment doesn’t just protect a speaker, but also those who want to hear what someone is saying,” wrote Chris Daley, the ACLU’s Indiana executive director. “And in the case of constitutional protections, ‘speech’ is interpreted broadly to include video productions, including pornography.” 
Bill author Sen. Mike Bohacek pushed for the bill, saying, “We have children who have seen hardcore content before they have their first kiss.”
The Michiana Shores Republican followed up the bill with another effort to limit social media access for children under the age of 16, but it died in the House after passing the Senate.

“Getting over it” will be hard in Kentucky, where the budget reconciliation bill is estimated to take health care from over 200,000 Kentuckians. Crucially, it also puts 35 rural Kentucky hospitals at risk of closure, more than any other state and 10% of the vulnerable hospitals across the entire country. These facilities depend heavily on the payments from Medicaid-covered patients to make emergency and specialty care available to everyone in the community.
Among the Kentucky hospitals that could shutter are five of the seven original Miners’ Memorial Hospitals set up by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1956. Those facilities — in Whitesburg, Middlesboro, Harlan, South Williamson and McDowell — are on the chopping block, along with Eastern Kentucky hospitals in Prestonsburg, Manchester, Louisa, Corbin, Mt. Sterling, Pineville, Irvine, Martin and Barbourville.
Coal mining has always been dangerous, but before the UMWA the work was brutal. Deaths and injuries were frequent, children worked in the mines, and pay was in the form of credit at the company store. It took often-bloody battles for the workers to win their union and a chance at a better life.
The UMWA Welfare and Retirement Fund, created through successful contract victories, built the Miners’ Memorial Hospitals to provide health care in coal communities where it was sorely lacking. But mechanization of coal mining led to deep job losses by the 1960s, and the UMWA was forced to sell the facilities to a nonprofit that eventually became Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH).
ARH and other Eastern Kentucky hospitals continue to provide everything from birthing to cancer care, and offer surgery, cardiology, physical and occupational therapy and family medicine. Rural people already travel much farther than others for health care and driving even longer distances due to shuttered hospitals will mean missed appointments and delayed treatment. That’s the difference between good health and bad, and between life and death.
The Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina reports that 196 rural hospitals have closed or converted since 2005, but Kentucky has been largely spared thanks to the funds provided by Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky lost four rural hospitals over those 20 years, while neighboring Tennessee — which did not expand Medicaid — lost 15.
ARH is the single largest employer in southeastern Kentucky, making potential Medicaid cuts a jobs issue as well. Health care and social assistance is the biggest industry in the Eastern Kentucky workforce area, employing 26,585 people or 25% of all jobs. And many other jobs in the region, like in retail (16,580 jobs) and government (23,192), depend on the spending and taxes of these hospitals’ nurses, therapists, physicians, technicians and more.
The threat to rural hospitals from proposed Medicaid cuts is a major point of contention over the bill. Some are floating the Band-Aid of a “rural hospital fund” that will only address a tiny fraction of the problem and is more a talking point than a solution.
Eastern Kentucky miners fought and died to create a health care system in a region where the market never would have on its own. Now members of Congress threaten to take it away. 
It’s to them, now, that the song penned during the union mine wars in Harlan County asks: “Which side are you on?”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/16-3056a.gif,,,2025-06-27 16:06:37.190861

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A Friday decision by the U.S. Supreme Court set the stage for a law restricting access to online pornography to take effect Tuesday in South Dakota, but the ruling doesn’t shield the state from lawsuits.
In Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the nation’s high court ruled that a Texas law requiring adults to prove their age to access adult-oriented websites is constitutional.
Under the Texas law, websites where one-third or more of the content is pornographic would have to collect information like photo identification or credit card information before allowing access.
The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment industry group, argued the law placed an unconstitutional burden on adults.
Governor signs age verification bill and lab-grown meat funding restrictions

The justices disagreed in their 6-3 decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court’s three liberal justices dissented.
“Obscenity is no exception to the widespread practice of requiring proof of age to exercise age-restricted rights,” Thomas wrote, citing laws restricting alcohol use or handgun purchases. 
South Dakota lawmakers passed, and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed, an age verification bill this year, but its language is more broad than that of the Texas law.
For the law set to take effect Tuesday in South Dakota, age verification would be required of any site that hosts adult material “in the regular course of the website’s trade or business.”
Lawmakers were cautioned during the session that such broad verbiage could draw First Amendment challenges regardless of the outcome in the Texas case. Some argued explicitly for an age verification law that mirrored the one in Texas.
South Dakota’s law requires websites to delete proof of age information immediately after an adult provides it. Adult websites that fail to perform age verification would be subject to criminal fines.
Ruling: ‘Incidental’ privacy infringement acceptable
The Supreme Court’s Friday ruling drew lines around any free speech arguments that might be deployed about South Dakota’s law.
At issue in the Texas case was not just the constitutionality of age verification laws, but how courts are meant to review them.
Texas wanted the Supreme Court to give it – and other states, by extension – broad authority to write laws restricting minors’ access to online pornography. The Free Speech Coalition said age verification laws ought to be minimally restrictive because they affect First Amendment rights.
Neither side prevailed on that issue. Instead, the justices said the Texas law stood up to what it called “intermediate scrutiny.” 
The state’s strictures amount to an “incidental” burden on adults’ free speech, but adults can still get the content, the majority ruled. 
A law that only requires age verification for sites on which one-third or more of the content is obscene is narrowly tailored enough to achieve Texas’ goal of targeting pornography, the court ruled.
“It is reasonable for Texas to conclude that websites with a higher proportion of sexual content are more inappropriate for children to visit than those with a lower proportion,” Thomas wrote.
In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the state of Texas ought to have tailored its law more narrowly “to ensure it is not undervaluing the interest in free expression.”
Restrictions on free speech, she said, should be viewed with the courts’ most critical eye.
“Many reasonable people, after all, view the speech at issue here as ugly and harmful for any audience,” Kagan wrote. “But the First Amendment protects those sexually explicit materials, for every adult. So a state cannot target that expression, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children.”
Future for South Dakota law
Unlike the Texas version, South Dakota’s age verification law does not apply to sites with a certain proportion of adult content.
It’s more sweeping language applying it to sites that host porn in their “regular course” of business was a cause of concern for some lobbyists and lawmakers, as well as for Attorney General Marty Jackley. 
Lobbyist Doug Abraham told the Senate Judiciary Committee in February that age verification for any site with adult material would be akin to carding anyone who enters a shopping mall because a store in the mall sells alcohol.
Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, who’s since been appointed as a circuit court judge, was among the lawmakers who argued on behalf of a bill with a one-third content standard nearly identical to the Texas law. That bill failed.
Jackley told lawmakers that he supports age verification for porn sites, but told them he’d rather defend a law that looks like the one passed by Texas.

Rep. Bethany Soye, R-Sioux Falls, sponsored the version of the bill that’s set to become law on Tuesday.
Soye told her colleagues that the one-third standard was “made up” by the Louisiana lawmakers who were the first to move on age verification.
A cutoff line for adult content creates a loophole, she said. To avoid adherence to the law, sites could make sure that their adult material represents just under one-third of its content.
Soye also said that legal battles sparked by a strong moral stance are worth the investment of the state’s time and treasure.
As of Friday afternoon, the state had not been sued in federal court over the law. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota argued against the bill in Pierre. Andrew Malone, its senior staff attorney, said Friday in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight that the Supreme Court “has departed from decades of settled precedents that ensured that sweeping laws purportedly for the benefit of minors do not limit adults’ access to First Amendment-protected materials.”
“With this decision, the court has carved out an unprincipled pornography exception to the First Amendment. The Constitution should protect adults’ rights to access information about sex online, even if the government thinks it is too inappropriate for children to see,” Malone said. “Efforts to childproof the internet not only hurt everyone’s ability to access information, but also give the government far too much leeway to go after speech it doesn’t like — all while failing to actually protect children.”
The Free Speech Coalition did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the South Dakota law, but Alison Boden, executive director, posted about the Paxton ruling on social media.
“As it has been throughout history, pornography is once again the canary in the coal mine of free expression,” Boden said, in part. “The government should not have the right to demand that we sacrifice our privacy and security to use the internet.”

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Lee’s Iowa newspapers include the Quad-City Times in Davenport, the Sioux City Journal, the Mason City Globe-Gazette the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier and the Muscatine Journal.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case
It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Two Oklahoma attorneys have sued state leaders, arguing that the state’s newly created business court system is unconstitutional. 
Joe E. White Jr. and Jason Waddell filed suit Thursday against Gov. Kevin Stitt, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton and House Speaker Kyle Hilbert. White and Waddell are seeking a temporary injunction from the Oklahoma Supreme Court that would block Stitt from appointing judges to the new business courts set to open later this year in Oklahoma City and Tulsa until the court can weigh on the constitutionality of Senate Bill 632. 
The lawsuit contends the legislation, which passed late in session, is unconstitutional in part because of the high $1,565 filing fee and because lawmakers are attempting to bypass the Judicial Nominating Commission, a voter-approved board that helps fills judicial vacancies by screening potential applicants and submitting a list of finalists to the governor to choose from. It also argues that the Legislature did not have the authority to create the courts.
An emergency injunction is necessary because the new law takes effect Sept. 1, and Hilbert is expected to soon submit nominees to the Governor for the first two judges who will preside over the business courts, according to the lawsuit. 
“It would be unfair to ask any applicant for one of the two judicial positions to give up their law practice or judgeship during the pendency of this action,” according to the lawsuit.
State leaders are also expected to begin leasing space in Oklahoma and Tulsa counties this summer and hire staff for the courts.
“This meritless lawsuit is a Hail Mary pass thrown by trial attorneys who profit from maintaining the status quo,” Stitt said. “Our business court law will make Oklahoma the most business friendly state, in part by limiting lawsuit abuse by trial attorneys.” 
Passing legislation creating a court system that specializes in litigating business disputes, commercial lawsuits and other related issues that equal or exceed $500,000 was a top priority for the Republican governor. 
Under the proposed system, the court’s judges would be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. They would be selected from a list of three candidates selected by the Speaker of the House. 
“This legal challenge to business courts was anticipated by members of the Legislature during session,” Hilbert said in a statement. “Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, the House is committed to ensuring an effective court system for all Oklahomans.”
A spokesman for Paxton declined to comment until they had time to review the lawsuit.

The Republican National Committee filed a motion in federal court Thursday asking to intervene in a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law.  Set to go into effect on Tuesday, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.

The po[...]","The Republican National Committee filed a motion in federal court Thursday asking to intervene in a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law. 
Set to go into effect on Tuesday, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. The law will also require someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in Wyoming for at least 30 days. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, filed a lawsuit in May, alleging the new law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague as written. The group has asked the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
High-profile attorneys — who have fought for and against President Trump on the national stage — have since flocked to both sides of the case. 
Even so, “when a state’s election laws are challenged in federal court, political parties should be granted intervention to protect their unique interests,” the Republican National Committee argued in its motion to intervene. 
If the court grants the request, the RNC would become a defendant in the case alongside Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the state’s 23 county clerks. 
As the primary governing body for the Republican Party in the United States, the group is responsible for organizing the party’s national convention, developing its political platform, coordinating campaign strategies and fundraising. 
When Arizona’s documentary-proof-of-citizenship requirement was challenged “on the same constitutional grounds in federal court, the RNC was granted intervention,” according to the motion. 
Wyoming’s law was a key priority for Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which wields a majority in the Wyoming House of Representatives. 
The secretary and the Freedom Caucus have both claimed Wyoming was “the first in the nation” to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. The RNC’s motion, however, indicates Arizona had already adopted such and seen it challenged in court. 
“The RNC’s involvement has proven essential in that [Arizona] case; it has raised arguments and appealed decisions that the state defendants wouldn’t, and it secured emergency relief from the Supreme Court this past election cycle that each state defendant opposed,” the motion states. 
The RNC also argues that “safeguarding Republican voter confidence in the legitimacy of Wyoming’s electoral process” necessitates the group’s intervention in the case. 
Last November, prior to the election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in the 2024 election to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey.
If the court were to rule against the new law, “the RNC would need to divert resources from other mission-critical activities towards get-out-the-vote activities to reinsure Republican voter trust in Wyoming’s electoral system, to independently verify the accuracy of Wyoming’s voter registration rolls, and to educate voters and candidates concerning Wyoming’s changed registration requirements,” the motion argues. 
The RNC also argues that the current defendants — Gray and the state’s county clerks — do not adequately represent the Republican Party’s interests. 
“Defendants are Wyoming state officials, who must necessarily represent ‘the public interest,’” the motion states. “By contrast, the RNC’s interest is inherently ‘partisan.’”
Gray told WyoFile he welcomes “this motion to help support our arguments in defending Wyoming’s common-sense, conservative election integrity law requiring proof of citizenship for registering to vote.” 
“We need all hands on deck to combat radical left-wing DNC attorney Marc Elias’ attacks on any and all conservative election integrity reforms, including Wyoming’s common-sense proof of citizenship requirement,” Gray wrote.
Friday marked the deadline for Gray and his attorneys to respond to the Equality State Policy Center’s request for a temporary restraining order against the law until the case has been resolved. It had not been filed by publishing time.

Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)In the shadow of Three Mile Island’s iconic cooling towers, state Rep. Tom Mehaffie recalled Wednesday how his father, 50 years earlier, built a career and a life around the nuclear power plant.
“When Constellation left and this plant shut down, a lot was missed,” Mehaffie said, noting the fortunes of businesses and the community followed that of the plant in Dauphin County.
Now, state government and energy and tech industry leaders are betting on its rebirth as an example of Pennsylvania’s readiness to power future industries, including electricity-intensive artificial intelligence data centers.
In a $16 billion deal between owner Constellation Energy and Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers, Three Mile Island is set to return to service as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Let’s not just open this plant, let’s open business,” Mehaffie told a tent full of Constellation Energy workers gathered to celebrate progress in the plant’s restoration, including an expedited review that cuts about a year off the project’s timeline.
About 10 miles south of Harrisburg near Middletown, Three Mile Island was the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that transfixed the world. But after that partial meltdown in one of the plant’s two reactors, the remaining Unit 1 continued safely producing electricity for another 40 years.
In 2019, Constellation determined the facility was no longer economically viable and put plans in motion to permanently decommission the reactor. With peak energy demand, driven largely by data centers, predicted to grow up to 17% by 2035, the plant’s capacity is now in high demand.
“We made a mistake in shutting down this plant, but we’re not here to dwell on that mistake,” Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said, noting that hiring staff for the recommissioning process is ahead of schedule because many former workers returned.
The plant’s reopening will support at least 650 permanent jobs and hundreds more for building-trade workers during the recommissioning process.
Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomed the returning workers Wednesday, as he highlighted the role of nuclear power in his energy plan.
“We’re going to make sure you never have to leave again,” Shapiro said. “This is going to be one of those places where the jobs get passed down from generation to generation, where fathers talk to their daughters about the work that they did, and their daughters pick up that mantle of energy leadership right here at Crane.”
Shapiro has outlined a plan over the last two years to ensure the commonwealth remains a leader in the competitive energy market, by leveraging the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Shapiro noted his administration intervened to ensure the Crane center would be able to quickly reconnect to the regional power grid that serves Pennsylvania and all or parts of 12 other states.
PJM Interconnect, which operates the grid and ensures adequate energy supplies, has a backlog of projects waiting to be approved for connection. The company created its Reliable Resource Initiative last year to expedite the interconnection of 51 shovel-ready generating resources that include battery storage, nuclear and natural gas facilities, a PJM spokesperson said.
Shapiro, who describes himself as an “all of the above energy governor,” noted the state has four operating nuclear power plants that provide nearly one-third of its energy.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Shapiro said. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said the Crane center is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring nuclear energy online with the speed needed to match the growth of artificial intelligence.
“It’s a unique opportunity where we can bring together a supportive community, state and a skilled workforce that is absolutely the best kept secret ingredient,” Hollis said.
Microsoft’s agreement to purchase all of the Crane center’s 835 megawatt output demonstrates the importance of abundant energy for tech industry growth, Shapiro said.
“That is a heck of a signal of the optimism people feel about Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting that Amazon also recently announced a $20 billion investment in a data complex near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County.
PJM interconnection president and CEO Manu Asthana said as the state swelters through its first heatwave of the summer, the growth in demand for energy is apparent. PJM this week recorded an all-time peak in electricity production, nine gigawatts larger than last summer’s peak. Asthana said the difference is equal to 11 times the Crane center’s planned output.
“What we’re talking about here is not hypothetical. Our country needs this power. All of our citizens need this power just to keep their lights on, to stay warm, to stay cool,” he said, adding that ensuring power for all that plus AI is a matter of national security.
“I can’t imagine by 2030 what artificial intelligence will enable us to do and strategically, for our country, for our state, for our region, it is critical that we win that race, and the power that you produce here is critical to winning that race.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Seven years after the Florida Legislature approved a memorial recognizing the tragedy of slavery for the grounds of the Florida Capitol, the bronze statue called “Circle of Chains” has been completed and is on display across the street from the building.
Not that anyone is actually aware of that.
“I had no idea!” Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt told the Phoenix when asked about the public unveiling of the memorial earlier this week.
Neither did Miami-Dade County Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“I had no idea the memorial had even been installed – and that says a lot,” Jones told the Phoenix. “A monument honoring the pain and resilience of enslaved Africans deserves more than a quiet placement. After seven years of work, there should have been a moment to honor that history publicly.”
Approved in 2018
The Legislature approved the memorial during the 2018 legislative session. Miami-Dade Democrat Kionne McGhee sponsored the measure in the House, and Tampa Bay-area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson carried it in the Senate. The bill charged the Department of Management Services with developing its design, placement, and cost. It is located at the Black Archives-Union Bank Museum on Apalachee Parkway and was installed on April 28.
“The idea behind the memorial is to recognize the brutality of slavery and the cruelty of slavery towards a people and then to honor the nameless faces of individuals that suffer through slavery,” Rouson said this week
State lawmakers dedicated $400,000 to erect the memorial, as they did during the 2016 legislative session for a Holocaust Memorial that was installed at the Capital earlier this year. A public ceremony was held  for that event in March, attended by Gov. DeSantis.
The monument was created by Carmel, California, sculptor Steven Whyte, selected by review committee members who called on artists to recognize “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the American colonies and to honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty contributions to the United States.”
As the House prepared to vote on the proposal in 2018, Rep. McGhee told lawmakers that slaves in 1845 helped construct the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee, according to WFSU-Radio. PolitiFact reported that although authorities were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction, African American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th Century, according to historians. PolitiFact labeled his comment “mostly true.” (McGhee, now a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, did not respond to a request for comment).
Plans for a Formal Ceremony
Rouson said he was informed by state officials that they wanted to install surveillance cameras on the property before making any formal announcement. “But now that surveillance is in place and there’s some protection in the event of vandalism, I intend to urge the Black Caucus to do more of a formal ceremony when we go back [this fall] for committee weeks,” he said.
Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said she knew the memorial was being constructed but wasn’t aware it had been finished and is now open to the public.
“I wholeheartedly support Sen. Rouson’s efforts for a formal opening ceremony this fall — the enslaved men, women, and children who built this country deserve to have their experience remembered and their legacy honored,” she said.
Sen. Jones said he also supports Rouson’s call for a “proper ceremony when we return.”
“Our ancestors deserve to be seen and acknowledged,” he said.

Dick Harpootlian, talk about their legal challenge to a legislative pay raise that inadvertently also halted existing payments outside Harpootlian's Columbia office on Monday, June 9, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State legislators will get a pay cut following a state Supreme Court order that halted so-called “in-district compensation” payments.
The Wednesday order came in response to a legal challenge over a $1,500 monthly raise legislators included in the state budget.
The $1,000 legislators have been receiving each month since 1995 under that same budget clause became collateral damage in the pause. If the state’s high court sides with the state senator questioning the constitutionality of the raise, the pay could go away altogether, cutting legislators’ incomes by $12,000 per year.
The change would apply only to the money meant to pay for duties outside the Statehouse. Legislators would still receive their annual salary of $10,400 and stipends for food and lodging during session, which are currently $240 per day.
The order instructed the state treasurer to stop “distributing any funds” under the clause included in the state budget that goes into effect Tuesday.
Because legislators rewrote the existing clause instead of adding a new one with the increased amount, that affected the entire sum they would have received.
“In light of the Court’s order, I want to inform you that, at a minimum, no in-district payments will be made on July 16 or August 16,” Senate President Thomas Alexander wrote in a letter to senators Wednesday. “To be specific, this amount includes both the prior $1,000 as well as the $1,500 increase. Any future payments will depend on further action by the Supreme Court in this matter.”
Representatives received a similar notification from the House clerk, emphasizing that the decision will affect the entire monthly payment, not just the raise.
Even the 44 Republicans in both chambers who turned down the increase will lose out on their normal $1,000 each month.
SC Supreme Court presses pause on legislative pay raise pending final decision

That could be the case for the foreseeable future, said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, who’s among the Republicans who opted out of the raise.
The court order set a deadline of Sept. 4 for legal filings, though it could take longer for justices to come to a decision.
If the justices decide the raise is unconstitutional, they can’t keep the original payments in play without rewriting a piece of the state budget, a move that would go beyond the court’s authority, the Edgefield Republican said.
Legislators could reinstate the original amount, but getting the votes to do so during an election year for the House, as 2026 will be, is unlikely because of the potential campaign fodder it could give opponents, Massey said.
In that case, legislators would go at least a year and a half with the lowest salary they’ve had in decades.
“I don’t think we can fix it,” Massey said.
That wasn’t the intention, said Sen. Wes Climer, who is challenging the raise in court. He didn’t have a problem with the in-district compensation itself, he added, but rather with legislators increasing it during a non-election year.
“It’s unfortunate,” the Rock Hill Republican said. “It’s not the desired outcome. But the fault for this outcome lies with those who tried to cheat. That outcome is still better than the Legislature appropriating itself the people’s money in real time.”
Climer, represented by former senator and Columbia attorney Dick Harpootlian, has argued in court filings that the raise violates a provision in the state constitution that bars legislators from increasing their own “per diem.”
When the 1890 constitution that still governs the state went into effect, that per diem was the only payment legislators received, so it effectively covered all of their income, Harpootlian has argued in court filings.
Attorneys for the House and Senate have argued the constitutional clause barring legislators from raising their own per diem applies only to the subsistence stipends meant to cover meals and lodging. The in-district compensation qualifies as a reimbursement, even though legislators don’t have to report how they spent the money, attorneys for both chambers have argued in legal filings.
Senators who voted both for and against the raise are frustrated knowing they’re getting at least a temporary pay cut, Massey said.
The last time legislators tried to increase their in-district compensation, in 2014, they did so in a separate budget clause that would have given legislators the option of an extra $1,000 per month. Then-Gov. Nikki Haley vetoed the raise, but because it was a separate part of the budget, legislators’ existing pay remained in place.
Losing a portion of what little legislators make “discourages people who don’t have individual wealth or own their own business from running for office,” said Rep. John King, a longtime supporter of increasing legislators’ pay.
The Rock Hill Democrat used his $1,000 each month to help pay for extra staff at the funeral home he runs so he could spend more time helping constituents, he said. He’ll be able to make up the difference by paying out of pocket, but others may not, he said.
Conversations around increasing pay to encourage more people to run for office are worthwhile, Massey said. Having people from different backgrounds often leads to more points of view on issues and, therefore, better legislation, he said.
“Having a pay decrease certainly doesn’t help that,” Massey said.
But legislators went about getting a raise the wrong way by adding it to the state budget instead of going through a committee process that would have included vetting and public input, he said. His opposition to how the raise was approved is why he turned it down.
Going through the normal committee process probably would have flagged the constitutional question and allowed legislators to write the law in a way that wouldn’t put their current pay in jeopardy, he said.
“There are consequences to doing it this way,” Massey said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4048-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement sai

Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced this week that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking Monday at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.

“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
More than 250,000 acres of federal land in North Dakota are categorized Inventoried Roadless Areas. Most of it is in the western part of the state.
Some road construction and reconstruction is already allowed on this land, according to a U.S. Forest Service map.
The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to an email seeking more specific information about how the policy change could affect North Dakota.
The office of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., called repealing the rule a step in the right direction.
“While road construction is currently permitted, rescission of the 2001 Roadless Rule removes the threat of future restrictions inhibiting access to multiple use activities like grazing and energy production,” the office said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican who attended the Western Governors’ Association meeting, also praised Rollins’ proposal.
“Increasing access to public lands is a win for North Dakota, and rescinding this rule further enables responsible federal lands management, including the continuation of responsible grazing practices,” Armstrong said in a statement.
Shannon Straight, executive director of the Badland Conservation Alliance, said that the proposed repeal of the rule is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to strip away public land protections.
“We’re losing our wilderness, we’re losing our habitat,” Straight said.
He also said millions of acres of public lands could be sold off under the “big, beautiful bill.” North Dakota isn’t one of them, according to an analysis published last week by the Wilderness Society, though the bill’s text is still being revised.
Straight said that regardless, North Dakotans that care about public lands should still urge the state’s congressional delegation to oppose the sales.
USDA says repealing ‘roadless’ protections will prevent wildfires. A new study disagrees

The roadless rule announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

In his lawsuit, Newsom claims that Fox News “covered up” the president’s false statement regarding the timing of a call between Trump and Newsom.


Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for defamation, claiming that the network lied about the date he last spoke with President Donald Trump on the phone and accused the governor of lying about the call.
“By disregarding basic journalistic ethics in favor of malicious propaganda, Fox continues to play a major role in the further erosion of the bedrock principles of informed representative government,” the lawsuit reads.
The lawsuit, filed Friday by Newsom as an individual, seeks $787 million in damages from the network — roughly the same amount Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 to settle a defamation case over the network’s election claims. Newsom promised to drop the suit if Fox News retracts its claim that Newsom lied and issues a formal on-air apology.
To some Democratic strategists, Newsom’s move demonstrates the governor’s willingness to check Trump’s power. It is the latest episode of an on-again-off-again feud between him and Trump, who collaborated over Los Angeles wildfire aid earlier this year but fought over the president’s deployment of troops to quell unrest in the same city despite Newsom’s objection.  
“Democrats across the country are out there yearning for Democrats to take on Trump,” said longtime Democratic consultant Garry South. “Partly through Trump’s own stumbles and his own mistakes, I think that he has inadvertently boosted Newsom into the position of being the chief protagonist against him.”
Fox News said in a statement that it would defend the case “vigorously.” 
“Gov. Newsom’s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him,” the statement said.
Newsom’s attorneys argued in a letter that the network intentionally misled its audience into believing the governor lied about his last call with Trump earlier this month, before the two clashed over Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement. 
The governor spoke with Trump over the phone for 16 minutes on June 7, the letter said. But Trump told a reporter on June 10 that he’d spoken with Newsom “a day ago” instead, stating that he had called Newsom “to tell him, got to do a better job, he’s doing a bad job.”
Newsom rebuked the president in a statement on X, arguing there was no call or even a voicemail from Trump on that day. “Americans should be alarmed that a President deploying Marines onto our streets doesn’t even know who he’s talking to,” he said.
But Fox News hosts John Roberts and Jesse Watters left out Trump’s comment suggesting the call had taken place June 9 in their coverage, Newsom’s attorneys argued. And Watters claimed on air that Newsom lied, even though he reported that call logs showed the call occurred on June 6.  
“Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him? Why would he do that?” Watters said, with a banner appearing on screen simultaneously that said: “Gavin lied about Trump’s call.”
Newsom’s attorneys argued the coverage shows the network’s effort to “cover up for President Trump’s error.”
But in suing Fox News, Newsom is taking a page from Trump’s own playbook by suing prominent media outlets for their coverage, drawing concern from First Amendment advocates who urged Newsom to drop the case.
“Lawsuits like this risk becoming a form of censorship and send a troubling message to news organizations: that they may face legal retaliation for their work,” said Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10072022-Newsom-Presser-RL-CM-011.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

With more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, our state is harnessing the power of the sun to lower energy bills, create jobs, and strengthen our grid.
But that progress — and the local jobs and savings it brings — is now under serious threat.
At the heart of this issue is the federal residential solar investment tax credit, known as the 25D credit.
For decades, this incentive has helped thousands of South Carolinians afford rooftop solar systems. It’s been a win-win: Homeowners cut their energy bills, and solar companies expand operations, hiring local workers to meet the growing demand.
But the so-called “One Big Beautiful” budget bill — which the president wants on his desk by July 4 — aims to eliminate the 25D credit within months.
This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.

The timing couldn’t be worse. Rooftop solar is an important energy generation source that can be scaled up quickly.
That speed is critical as our state grapples with rising electricity demand, aging grid infrastructure, and the growing costs of fossil fuels.
And the potential doesn’t stop at homes.
South Carolina is rich in industrial and commercial rooftop space — warehouses, factories, and retail stores with untapped solar potential. Ending the 25D credit would slam the brakes on this opportunity just as momentum is building.
The broader economic impact is no less troubling.
A new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that gutting these tax credits could cause an immediate drop in solar and storage investments across the U.S.
By 2030, as much as $220 billion in investment could be lost. This doesn’t just impact solar panel installers, but also manufacturers, electricians, engineers, and logistics providers who all contribute to this growing clean energy economy.
And as Republicans in the Senate thrash out the details, the policy uncertainty is already having repercussions. More than $9 billion in investments have already been cancelled or stalled in 2025, according to E2. Republican districts have been hit the hardest.
In South Carolina, we’ve already seen what federal clean energy incentives can do.
Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, our state has secured over $15 billion in clean energy investment — second only to North Carolina. Projects from companies like Scout Motors and Redwood Materials are bringing thousands of new jobs to the Palmetto State.
Unfortunately, many of the same South Carolina lawmakers whose districts are benefiting from this boom have succumbed to partisan pressure to phase out the very credits spurring the investment. That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.
This isn’t just bad politics — it’s an economic misfire.
Removing the 25D credit means fewer homeowners can afford solar, fewer installers stay in business, and fewer South Carolinians get hired. It also makes our grid more vulnerable and our energy prices more volatile.
Meanwhile, state-level actions like the so-called South Carolina Energy Security Act, which was signed into law in May, are poised to make things worse by allowing utilities to raise rates annually.
Repealing existing federal clean energy tax credits and funding programs would increase average annual household energy costs in South Carolina (including electricity and fuel expenses) by nearly $50 per year in 2030 and nearly $270 per year in 2035 (Energy Innovation Policy & Technology).
The good news? The bill is not yet signed, sealed or delivered to the Oval Office.
Preserving the 25D credit and other clean energy incentives could add $32 billion to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade and support nearly 220,000 full-time jobs, according to a study commissioned by American Clean Power.
This isn’t a red state or blue state issue — it’s a commonsense economic one.
Clean energy tax credits are delivering real results in South Carolina.
Undoing them now would undercut years of progress, threaten jobs, and raise costs for families and businesses.
Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and their colleagues in the House have long championed South Carolina’s economic growth.
They can now help protect one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, rooftop solar, and the jobs of hardworking South Carolinians who are building our clean energy future — one rooftop at a time.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-at-home-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker began his third campaign for governor on Thursday, but much of the buzz around his 2026 campaign announcement focused on 2028.

Pritzker made four stops around the state to launch his campaign, fielding questions about any future interest in the presidency and what is driving him to run for what would be a historic third term. In his final stop in Springfield on Thursday evening, he was toasting personally branded “JBeers” – his own craft beer product he unveiled at least year’s Democratic National Convention – with a group of about 100 people at a small event venue just outside the Capitol and talking about his motivations.

“Every day I’m going to wake up going forward thinking about what I am going to do that’s going to help the people of Illinois,” Pritzker told reporters in Springfield when asked how many years of a third term he would serve. “So that’s the reason I’m running for reelection, it’s why I announced today, it’s what I’m going to do every day going forward no matter what decision I make.”

The 60-year-old Democrat’s national profile has grown significantly over the last year. He was a finalist to be former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate last July, and weeks later, introduced himself to the country on the stage of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In the months since President Donald Trump took office, Pritzker has emerged as one of his most vocal critics.

At news conferences throughout the state, Pritzker did not directly commit to serving a full four-year term if he is reelected and sidestepped questions about his rumored White House ambitions.

But while staying tight-lipped about what he thinks about his prospects in the 2028 presidential election, he said any decision he makes about his future would be Illinois-centric.

Speculation shows Pritzker ‘capable and competent’

In the meantime, Pritzker said he believed his inclusion in the national conversation is good for Illinois.

“When I ran for governor in the first place in 2017 and 2018, never, never could I have imagined that anybody would talk about me as the potential vice-presidential nominee or as a candidate for president of the United States,” Pritzker said.

While Republicans have frequently criticized the governor for his tendencies to criticize Trump rather than work with him to Illinois’ benefit, the governor spun his rising national profile as a positive.

“Having the state of Illinois’ leaders viewed as capable and competent and potentially able to run the entire country and being talked about in that way, allows us, I think, to get more for the people of Illinois because there’s an understanding that, you know, maybe in Illinois we’re doing the right things,” he said. “Maybe in Illinois we have leaders that can competently execute on what states really need.”

Pritzker said his experience last summer being vetted for the vice presidency has not played any role in the decisions he has made about his political career.

Should Pritzker decide to run for president, an announcement would likely come at some point in 2027 during what would be the first year of his third term if he’s reelected.

Pritzker’s goal: ‘Protect’ Illinois and his legacy

Pritzker said at his announcement Thursday that his goal in 2026 is to preserve his legacy and “protect” the story of Illinois that’s been written under his leadership. Pritzker didn’t outline a bold vision for his third term but rather pledged to build off what he has already accomplished.

He said his third term would focus on grappling with artificial intelligence, addressing the rising cost of living, continued spending on infrastructure and growing the state’s economy.

Pritzker reflected on his decision to seek reelection despite growing challenges facing the state.

“I don’t shy away from a fight, and we’re going to have to protect the people of Illinois,” Pritzker told reporters in Springfield. “And I feel like we’re in a moment when backing away from public service when things are hard doesn’t feel right. So that’s one of the reasons I chose to run for reelection.”

Pritzker was asked whether he would have run had Trump not been elected last year.

“I think I would, but I have to say that in this moment, it feels like walking away is the wrong thing to do given who is in the White House and given how this administration is attacking people all across this country,” Pritzker said.

The governor must also choose a new running mate as Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has decided to run for U.S. Senate. Pritzker said he will choose one by the end of July so his campaign can start circulating nominating petitions in early August. Pritzker said in Chicago that he is looking for someone with enough experience to take over as governor if required.

Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, may be an early front-runner for the job. Pritzker specifically referred to Gordon-Booth as qualified at a stop in East Peoria on Thursday when asked about potential running mates, WGLT reported. The assistant House majority leader has been in the General Assembly since 2009.

Taylor. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a preliminary victory Friday to Maryland parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian parents after Montgomery County, Maryland, schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.



Florida now requires schools to implement a review process for library materials objected to by parents and community members who think the content is pornographic or inappropriate. Laws that necessitate parental approval have drawn lawsuits and free speech concerns. Lawmakers have acknowledged excessive numbers of objections were raised and now nonparent residents are restricted to one objection per month.
In Florida, the attorney general recently opened a parental-rights arm to litigate laws related to gender transition, library materials, school surveys, and other topics that have dominated legislative, judicial, and executive conversations in recent years. In announcing the office, Uthmeier said Florida has been a “shining city on a hill” for “enshrining parental rights.”

Brenda Johnston Naatz Bandy passed gracefully on Wednesday, June 25th, 2025, surrounded by love, laughter, and music. Born on November 4th, 1939, in St. Johnsbury to Doris and Charles Naatz, she was an excellent daughter, sister, and occasional farmhand on their family dairy farm.
Among Brenda’s many gifts was the ability to make life feel simultaneously sacred and as amusing as a Carol Burnett skit. Her beauty was only rivaled by her talent, humor, and boundless care for others. As Miss Vermont, she performed a side-splitting Victor Borge comedy routine on the piano at the 1960 Miss America Pageant, winning the talent portion of the competition. She earned scholarships for her creative skills and attended Rochester Institute of Technology to study Interior Design before returning to Vermont to care for her mother in her final years. While Miss Vermont, she also won the attention of her assigned Cadet escort, Bill Currier, with whom she quickly fell in love. They married and traveled the world while raising three rambunctious children before settling in upstate New York. There, she was a church organist, choir director, a full-time mother, and the one-woman powerhouse of an 11-acre horse farm, where she boarded over a dozen horses and taught riding—all while keeping her sense of humor (and most of her sanity). 
She played every instrument she encountered with otherworldly skill, though her favorites include the pipe organ at the Peacham Congregational Church, piano, bagpipes, and the accordion. In addition to her endless musical and performing talents, she was a gifted craftsperson. She excelled at creating model horse-drawn carriages and miniature dollhouses along with all of the delicate painting, sculpture, and leatherwork that entailed.

A lifelong equestrian, Brenda’s love for horses easily withstood a lifetime of shoveling manure. She won several accolades and blue ribbons for her Morgan horses—including one New York State Grand Champion Morgan mare, Vanderland Gabrielle “Gabby”—and taught all of her children and grandchildren how to ride (and clean the stalls). Her deep love for animals was unmatched; even the most skittish stray cats grew to return her affections tenfold. 
Brenda was a skillful and beloved teacher and returned to school to earn her music teaching degree in 1986 at the age of 47. She taught music to all grades at Blue Mountain Union, where she met her second husband, Arnold Bandy, a social studies teacher and athletic director. Together, they shared great pride in teaching and learning with their students. With endless energy and enthusiasm, she led her students to create elaborate, impressive musical productions. Her pride in teaching was well earned, as she taught all those around her how to make things that mattered—music, art, a home, a life—by hand, by heart, and with just the right amount of humor.
For Brenda, the sun rose and set over the children in her life. She is survived by her beloved children, Tonya Currier and her husband Dan Griggs, Miles Currier and his wife Cheryl, Matthew Bandy and his wife Anne, and Auburn Watersong; her niece, Jennifer Gilman and her husband Peter Pelissier; her adored grandchildren, Tia Hohman and her husband Rusty, Gabe Harter, Emma Harter, and Liam Currier; her great-niece Kelsey Gilman and her great-nephews Teddy Gilman and Chad Larabee; her dearest and only great-grandchildren, Eden and Ezra Hohman. Brenda leaves behind a sprawling chosen family of dear friends and creative kin who will carry her memory forward with laughter, music, and love. 
In her passing, Brenda joins her husband, Arnold Bandy, her dear sisters Carolyn and Frannie, her beloved nephew Charlie “Thumper” Gilman, many close girlfriends, as well as dozens of spoiled horses, ponies, cats, dogs, and at least one goat waiting patiently for her to return with treats.

Patrick Morrisey gives an update on flood recovery at the Marion County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management  in Fairmont, W.Va. on Friday, June 27, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)Flash floods on Thursday evening struck several parts of West Virginia, including an area in the northern part of the state still reeling from severe weather earlier this month. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Friday no loss of life has been reported as a result of Thursday’s flash floods. Officials are assessing any new damage that might have occurred in Ohio County on Thursday, he said. 
“I know that I saw some pictures coming out of Triadelphia from last night, and that was a community that was hit very, very hard,” Morrisey said Friday during a press briefing from Fairmont. 
According to the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh, about 1.6 inches of rain fell in an hour in parts of the Wheeling area Thursday evening, causing roads and basements to flood and some creeks to exceed their banks. 
Nine people died in the flash floods that washed through northern West Virginia after several inches of rain fell in a short period of time June 14 and 15. 
The body of a ninth victim, 83-year-old Sandra Kay Parsons, was found in the Ohio River on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. No other people are believed to be unaccounted for, Morrisey said this week.
Overnight Thursday, high water caused the northbound lanes of the West Virginia Turnpike to be closed near the Dawes exit in Kanawha County for more than eight hours, according to news reports. 
According to radar estimates from the National Weather Service in Charleston, around 6 inches of rain fell Thursday evening in that area of the county, meteorologist Ray Young said. 
Morrisey said state officials are investigating the Turnpike closure, which he called “unacceptable.”
“We’re going to get to the bottom of everything,” Morrisey said. “I’m going to tell you that we’re going to get to the bottom of things to make sure that everything is done right, and if there are problems that were decisions that were made that were bad, we’re going to make sure that we let people know about that… But most importantly, we’re trying to make sure that that road is fully passable.”
Morrisey has asked for a federal disaster declaration that would make assistance available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Ohio and Marion counties for the floods earlier this month. He said he’s been in close contact with the Trump administration about the request. 
Morrisey stressed that flooded residents who have not done so should fill out a damage survey, available online at emd.wv.gov 
“Ultimately, that’s a critical part of the process to ensure that the feds know exactly what happened on the ground, and then they’ll make financial decisions as a result of it,” he said. “So if you haven’t done so already, we urge people to fill out their disaster survey form.”
Morrisey announced this week the West Virginia Housing Development Fund has approved providing about $500,000 for housing assistance to flooded residents. The funding is also available for those affected by floods in February. 
“It’s hard to fathom just how hard these communities were hit, but they have come together with strength and resilience during this challenging time,” Morrisey said in a statement. “The funds that I’ve made available for housing-related expenses are another step in the recovery process, and we’re working as quickly as possible to distribute these funds to those who need them.”
To apply for housing assistance, flooded residents can visit the Housing Development Fund’s website at https://www.wvhdf.com. 
In addition to the housing assistance, SNAP recipients who lost food during the June 14 and 15 flash floods have until July 7 to apply for benefits to replace it, the state Department of Health announced Thursday. 
The department extended the deadline to apply by 10 days, according to a news release. The extension applies to households in Marion, Ohio and Monongalia counties who lost food because of the severe storms that began on June 14. 
SNAP recipients are eligible for replacement benefits if they lost food due to a power outage that lasted more than four hours, the DoHS said. They must provide verification and a signed affidavit. For more information, contact a local DoHS county office or call the state Office of Constituent Services’ Customer Service Hotline at 1-877-716-1212.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Trump administration on Friday, the state of Washington still intends to seek a nationwide block of the president’s order to restrict birthright citizenship. 
“Washington still plans to seek relief for all its harms — that is what we argued for and won in the trial court,” attorney general’s office spokesperson Mike Faulk said in an email Friday.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, alongside attorneys general from Oregon, Arizona and Illinois, had argued nationwide relief was necessary while litigation plays out over the order. 
But in a 6-3 ruling in the case on Friday, the Supreme Court imposed new limits on lower court judges issuing nationwide injunctions. 
Under the ruling, President Donald Trump’s order could go into effect in 30 days in states that didn’t sue, raising the possibility that babies born to immigrant parents in Washington would be U.S. citizens, while those born in neighboring states like Idaho would not be.
The high court did not rule on the merits of Trump’s executive order. Further legal battles over the order, including with the lawsuit backed by Washington, still lie ahead.
Brown has argued previously that the state, instead of the federal government, would have to pay for social services for babies born in other states without birthright citizenship who later move to states like Washington.
In his Feb. 6 injunction, U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour in Seattle agreed, ordering that anything less than nationwide relief is “ineffectual.” Coughenour’s order was one of three nationwide injunctions the Supreme Court considered.
Brown, in a statement, noted that the justices “confirmed that courts may issue broad injunctions when needed to provide complete relief to the parties.”
“We continue to believe that President Trump’s unconstitutional and cruel order must be stopped across the country to guarantee protection for Washington and its residents,” he continued.
Washington’s case currently sits at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after arguments in Seattle this month. Whether the Supreme Court’s ruling sends the case back to Coughenour is unclear. Faulk said the attorney general’s office expects more clarity on this question soon.
Trump’s executive action aims to end birthright citizenship for babies born to a mother and father who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
In 2022, about 4,000 babies were born in Washington to two parents without legal immigration status, according to the states’ lawsuit.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3450-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

Jeff Landry shakes the hand of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before a bill signing ceremony June 27, 2025, at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry endorsed legislation Friday to “Make American Healthy Again” with the nation’s controversial top health official at his side for the bill signing ceremony.
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended a bill signing ceremony at Pennington Biomedical Research Center after helping craft legislation the Louisiana Legislature approved unanimously to regulate what ingredients can be in the food served in public school lunches.
Kennedy said he anticipates other states will follow Louisiana’s lead, resulting in food manufacturers proactively making changes to improve the contents of their products and reduce the amount of ultra-processed food they generate.  
“We’re seeing the companies coming to the table … because they don’t want what you’re doing here in Louisiana,” Kennedy told the audience.
The key bill Landry signed was Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, which bans several dyes, artificial sweeteners and other ingredients from school meals. In its original state, the proposal also sought to restrict what people could purchase with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, but those provisions were stripped out during the legislative process. 
“It’s about transparency for restaurants and food manufacturers to disclose the types of foods they’re serving us and the impacts on our bodies,” McMath said during his introduction of Kennedy and the governor.

Landry announced Friday he would seek a waiver from the Trump administration to prohibit the purchase of some unhealthy foods with SNAP benefits and seek permission to let people buy certain prepared foods, such as rotisserie chicken. 
McMath’s bill is part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemical additives Kennedy has targeted for elimination. Such products are typically high in calories, sugar, salt and unhealthy fats.
Kennedy, who worked with McMath on the bill, said most of America’s chronic health issues can be linked to the foods they consume.  
Also signed was Senate Bill 19 by Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, which allows pharmacists to provide ivermectin without a doctor’s prescription. Its proponents say ivermectin can be successfully used to treat a variety of ailments, including COVID-19, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved its use for intestinal parasites in pill form and to treat head lice and rosacea as a topical cream.
Though Kennedy praised the bills Landry signed into law, he also called for Congress to approve comparable federal measures. 
“We need national laws, and we’re going to do it on our own,” Kennedy said.

The bill signing ceremony took place at a conference center on the Pennington campus, where the audience included supporters and their children wearing green “MAHA Louisiana” hats. They took to the stage to provide a backdrop for Landry and Kennedy. 
Approximately a dozen conservative legislators were also in attendance. Earlier this month, the state Legislature approved $2 million for Pennington in the state budget to fill in the gaps of Kennedy’s cuts. 
The LSU Board of Supervisors recessed its bi-monthly meeting so its members could take part in the event.
Kennedy previously came to Baton Rouge in 2021 to testify before state lawmakers against a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for K-12 students. It was Landry, who was then the state’s attorney general, who invited him to appear before the legislative committee.
Kennedy’s appearance at Pennington Biomedical Research Center comes as the future of some employees at the facility and their work are in question as the Trump administration proposes drastic reductions in health and scientific research. 
Most recently, Kennedy has removed the members of a vaccine advisory panel for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and replaced them with vaccine skeptics.
Pennington has so far lost $4.1 million in federal research funding from agencies Kennedy oversees, which does not include the tens of millions more they are slated to lose if Kennedy’s proposed slashing of “indirect cost rates” goes into effect. 
When the Illuminator approached Kennedy after the event to ask about these cuts, a staff member quickly whisked him away, saying “he’s not taking questions.”
Dozens of people lined Perkins Road outside the research center to protest Kennedy’s visit.  
The people gathered included Jeanne George of Baton Rouge, whose granddaughters accompanied her and held protest signs by the roadside waiting for Kennedy to arrive.
“I grew up in the 1950s, and I had classmates who had braces because of polio,” George said. “So I’ve seen the benefits of vaccinations from the 1950s on, and I just feel so strongly about the importance of not not rolling us back. We need to continue to have the children being vaccinated. We need to have the flu vaccines. We need to have scientists making decisions about vaccinations and about health.”
Gayle Choojitarom, a retired cardiopulmonary health care professional, came to the protest from Watson. She worked the latter stretch of her career in New Orleans and took issue with the governor choosing a research institute for a “Make America Healthy Again” event.
“If legislation is put forth to Make America healthy again, it should be led by science and by facts and not by vibes and opinions,” Choojitarom said. 
She recalled treating someone in the late 1980s who contracted polio and relied on an iron lung, a respiratory device that helps someone breathe when they have trouble doing so on their own. The eradication of polio through vaccines in the U.S. in 1979 all but eliminated the need for such equipment, but Choojitarom said she fears Kennedy’s policy on vaccine approval and research will erase such progress. 
“We’re going to see more people die,” she said.” We’re going to see children die. We’re going to see babies die.”

(Lori Higgins / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
The high per-student cost for operating buildings at 19 Detroit district schools, some of which also have low enrollment and are underutilized, is creating funding challenges and will have officials wrestling with what to do with them in the coming years.
The district is already in the process of phasing out the operation of four of the schools, but that may not be the fix the district seeks with the remaining schools. No recommendations have been made to the board. But a report on the small schools, discussed during a school board committee meeting Wednesday, outlined potential solutions that include merging schools, stepping up enrollment efforts, reconfiguring grades served, and investing in marketing.
The costly schools in the Detroit Public Schools Community Schools aren’t covering their costs, meaning their expenses far outweigh the revenue received through state and federal funding and grants, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said during the committee meeting.
Northwestern High School, for example, enrolls 302 students and the building has a utilization rate of 23%. On the other side of the city, Pershing High School’s utilization rate is 20%. It enrolls 421 students.
Underutilized schools are a critical issue in Detroit, given the district must fill in the gaps in revenue for the schools that don’t have enough per-pupil revenue coming in. But it’s not a problem unique to Detroit. Enrollment declines across the U.S. mean many districts are grappling with what to do with underutilized schools.
DPSCD enrollment has declined from more than 156,000 in the 2002-03 school year to 49,000 during the last school year. The declines have left schools with far fewer students than they were originally built to hold.
Vitti said Wednesday that the community should not look at the list of 19 schools and assume they are all going to be slated for closure.
“It just means that in order for these schools to continue to function … we have to move money (in the budget) to cover the costs,” he said.
“Most of these schools are going to be fine,” Vitti said later in the meeting. But, he said, the district will have to consider the long-term future of underutilized schools with buildings that need costly work.
Board member Angelique Peterson-Mayberry, who chairs the board’s academics committee, said the information shared at Wednesday’s meeting is important for the community “to go deep into.”
“There’s a science and a method to why we’re saying if schools aren’t kind of paying for themselves with enrollment, this is a way to unpack that so that they understand,” Peterson-Mayberry said.
Among the 19 schools are a handful the district is already phasing out, including Ann Arbor Trail Magnet School, J.E. Clark Preparatory Academy, Catherine Blackwell Institute, and Greenfield Union Elementary-Middle School. At these schools, the district has stopped accepting new students and those enrolled at the time the phase-out began will be allowed to remain until they matriculate. When that happens, the schools will close.
The list includes Paul Robeson-Malcolm X Academy, which moved to another location during the last school year. That move was necessary because the district is constructing another building for the school at the old site. But the move has resulted in enrollment declines — from 392 students to 299 — as some parents opted not to make the move. The district expects enrollment to return to normal once the new school opens.
The list also includes two Montessori schools. Those schools are more costly to operate because Montessori programs require more paraprofessionals than a traditional school, the report says.
The report includes a cost per student as well as what the cost is for a comparison school. The comparison schools are similar schools based on grade band and enrollment type. For instance, schools that require an exam or application in order to enroll are compared to each other.
Below is a list of the schools on the list, not including those already being phased out:
Frederick Douglass Academy for Young Men

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 69
Utilization rate: 5%
Revenue: $1,723,543
Expenses: $3,049,269

Potential solution: Relocating the school to another high school and operate as a separate school within a school.

Davis Aerospace Technical High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 96
Utilization rate: 13%
Revenue: $1,888,804
Expenses: $3,082,647

Enrollment: 391
Utilization rate:
Revenue: $6,555,334
Expenses: $7,809,592
Cost per student: $19,973
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: “Because the demand and need for alternative education settings are high, and because students at the school need smaller, supportive learning environments, continue to fund at current levels,” the report states.

Detroit International Academy for Young Women

Grades: K-12
Enrollment: 246
Utilization rate: 16%
Revenue: $4,066,670
Expenditures: $4,843,925

Potential solution: Eliminate some positions and long-term, consider moving the school to another high school building to operate as a program within a school.

Carstens Academy of Aquatic Science

Grades: PreK-8
Enrollment: 274
Utilization rate: 40%
Revenue: $5,157,224
Expenses:$5,517,800
Cost per student: $20,138
Comparison school cost per student: $14,503
Potential solution: The report says leadership challenges over the years led to low reenrollment rates, and that a new leader along with a new building will restore enrollment and overcome the funding gap.

Mark Twain School for Scholars

Grades: PreK-8
Enrollment: 253
Utilization rate: 49%
Revenue: $4,729,176
Expenses: $5,024,224

Comparison school cost per student: $14,503
Potential solution: The district suggests providing the school with prioritized enrollment and reenrollment support.

Northwestern High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 302
Utilization rate: 23%
Revenue: $4,835,242
Expenses: $5,172,957
Cost per student: $17,129
Comparison school cost per student: $12,377
Potential solution: Continue providing prioritized enrollment support with a focus on reenrollment of current students. The district could also consider turning it into a K-12 school by merging with Sampson-Webber Leadership Academy or as a special education center site.

Osborn High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 413
Utilization rate: 34%
Revenue: $6,022,533
Expenditures: $6,440,302
Cost per student: $15,594
Comparison school cost per student: $12,377
Potential solution: Continue providing prioritized enrollment support with a focus on 9th grade recruitment. The district may also consider the phase-out of Osborn after the new Pershing building opens.

Edison Elementary School (Montessori)

Grades: Pre-K to third grade
Enrollment: 277
Utilization rate: 67%
Revenue: $4,946,746
Expenses: $5,139,978
Cost per student: $18,556
Comparison school cost per student: $14,859
Potential solution: Provide school with prioritized enrollment and reenrollment support. The district may also consider a new building for the school.

Detroit School of Arts

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 523
Utilization rate: 58%
Revenue: $7,362,518
Expenses: $7,706,953
Cost per student: $14,736
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: The district will continue to develop and expand the K-8 performing arts programs to increase enrollment at DSA. Enrollment is actually on the rise at the school, but staff costs are expensive because of the arts programming, the report says.

Pershing High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 421
Utilization rate: 20%
Revenue: $6,125,510
Expenses: $6,328,932
Cost per student: $15,033
Comparison school cost per student: $12,377
Potential solution: Continue providing prioritized enrollment support with a focus on 9th grade recruitment. The district anticipates a new building being constructed for the school will increase enrollment.

Paul Robeson Malcolm X Academy

Grades: PreK-8
Enrollment: 299
Utilization rate: 82%
Revenue: $5,466,768
Expenses: $5,519,697
Cost per student: $18,461
Comparison cost per school: $14,859
Potential solution: The report says: “The school is currently operating out of the former CMA (Communication and Media Arts High School), while a new building is constructed. This had a negative impact on enrollment. When the school relocates back to its new building enrollment will fully fund the school.”

Edmonson Elementary (Montessori)

Grades: Pre-K to 8th grade
Enrollment: 260
Utilization rate: 43%
Revenue: $4,331,072
Expenses: $4,340,392
Cost per student: $16,694
Comparison school cost per student: $14,859
Potential solution: Continue to expand the number of seats in lower grades if teachers and paraprofessionals can be hired to build enrollment and address demand for seats in primary grades. Enrollment is actually on the rise, but the Montessori program requires more staffing than a traditional school, which increases costs.

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow)Community organizers gathered in Raleigh Thursday for a press conference to raise awareness about what they described as attacks on marginalized communities.
The press conference brought together several local organizations from the Triangle region, including Muslims for Social Justice, People’s Power Lab, Refund Raleigh and Education Justice.
Manzoor Cheema, an organizer with Muslims for Social Justice and People’s Power Lab, said post-9/11 policies, that initially targeted Muslims have since expanded to affect immigrants of all backgrounds.
“Black, brown and Muslim community members are victims of frequent state-based injustices,” said Cheema, who has been active in the Triangle area for 25 years. “If you see an attack against one community member, you have to speak up, because next time it will be replicated to other people.” 
The organizations also call for ending U.S. military actions abroad, providing full funding for public services like schools, healthcare and housing.
Speakers also called out recent actions by the Trump administration, which has revoked the visas of more than a dozen international students across North Carolina.
 Nique Williams, representing Refund Raleigh, expressed solidarity with Palestinians and condemned what she said was U.S.-funded military operations. 
“We should be funding care. We should be funding love. We should be funding the needs of our people, instead of funding genocide and war,” Williams said. 
Preserving Palestinian identity through food
The organizers gathered at a new restaurant in Northeast Raleigh called Flip It! where Nahla Ahmad, owner of the seven-month-old restaurant, has made it her mission to educate people about Palestinian culture through food. “I want people to get to know the Palestinian culture, and I want people to know that Palestine existed,” said Ahmad.
Ahmad, who is 63 and has lived in the U.S. for 32 years, said her restaurant isn’t political but rather focused on preserving cultural identity.
The restaurant’s name comes from Maqluba, a traditional Palestinian dish literally meaning “upside down” served by flipping it so “the good stuff in the bottom comes on top.” It symbolizes Ahmad’s mission: turning perceptions about Palestinian culture right-side up. Each plate served, she said, is an invitation to understand a rich heritage she said is often misunderstood.
“We have been struggling for about 80 years just to make sure that people know that we are there. We have our own culture, our own food, our own country, and we are trying to spread the culture, the information about us so we can get as much support as we can.”
For Ahmad, this isn’t just about food. It’s about showing the world that Palestine is not just a place on a map, but a culture with deep roots and enduring spirit, she said. Through every plate of Maqluba turned upside down, Ahmad invites diners to flip their understanding—and truly see Palestine.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1804-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

(Photo provided by Free & Just)Even before federal abortion-rights protections were overturned three years ago, a Fargo mother says she had to travel hundreds of miles and across state lines to end a life-threatening pregnancy.
Randi Lamoureux, an educator and business owner, became pregnant with her son Lammy in 2017. At 19 weeks, he was diagnosed with a severe fetal abnormality called DiGeorge syndrome. Lamoureux’s doctor told her that both she and Lammy were at risk for cardiac arrest if she stayed pregnant.
Lamoureux said she had to travel more than 300 miles for care at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
By the time she could make the trip, she was almost too far along under that state’s law.
“That was literally the absolute last day that I could get it in Minnesota,” she said. “More than 24 hours later, I would have had to have gone to another state.”
More miscarriages criminally investigated three years into post-Dobbs abortion bans

Lamoureux said the weeks before and after were full of devastating decisions she never imagined having to make. 
“Do we hold our baby? Do we take pictures of our baby? Do we cremate him?” she said. “Those are things that nobody else should have a say in, ever.”
Though Lamoureux, born and raised in Grafton, is conservative and deeply religious, she said she wants other North Dakotans to see abortion not as a political or religious issue, but as a personal and private choice. No one can understand that decision until they’re faced with it, she said.
“I wish I could have invited Kevin Cramer into the hospital room when we had to make decisions,” she said of the U.S. senator from North Dakota.
Today, Lamoureux lives in Fargo with her husband and 5-year-old daughter. She said she now considers abortion-rights advocacy part of her life’s purpose.
“I don’t want my 5-year-old daughter or anybody else’s daughters or anybody else to have to go through what I went through,” she said.
Earlier this week, Lamoureux traveled to D.C. with a group of other women who have been impacted by state-level abortion policy. They were invited to share their stories at a summit organized by Free and Just, an abortion-rights group, to mark the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which gave rise to a patchwork of state abortion laws across the country. 
As part of the trip, Lamoureux said she went to the hill and met with members of Congress.
She said it felt good to share her story, but she can’t help but find it unfair that women like her have to recount such difficult experiences to try and shift policy. 
“To me, it’s like: Why? Why do we have to justify this? Why do we have to share our stories with anyone?” she said. “However, it’s the reality, and our stories are what make change.”
Lammy is still part of daily life for Lamoureux and her family. She said her parents recently visited his grave in Rochester.
“They called us, and we said a prayer together as a family,” Lamoureux said. “My parents left two little trucks for him and a sunflower.”
North Dakota Supreme Court hears arguments over abortion ban

Under a district court ruling last fall, abortion is legal in North Dakota through fetal viability, thought to be around 24 weeks, but no clinics provide abortion care in the state. 
North Dakota had adopted a law in 2023 banning all abortions except when the pregnancy poses a serious health risk to the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest in the first six weeks of pregnancy. That policy was struck down as unconstitutional last year by a District Court judge. The ruling was appealed to the North Dakota Supreme Court, which has yet to make a final decision in the case.
During the 2025 session, Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, introduced a bill he said sought to strike a compromise between reproductive freedom and regulation. It would have allowed women to receive abortions for any reason through week 15 of pregnancy, while medical professionals would decide whether to allow later term abortions on a case-by-case basis. The House overwhelmingly rejected the policy.
In a 2023 ruling striking down a previous state abortion ban, the North Dakota Supreme Court found that women have a fundamental right to seek abortions for health reasons. The justices also found that the state has a compelling interest in protecting unborn life. 
In a January opinion in the lawsuit, the state Supreme Court indicated that it may have to decide how to balance these interests as it considers the pending appeal over the state’s abortion law. It takes a fourth-fifths vote by the high court to declare a law unconstitutional in North Dakota.

(Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)As NATO wrapped up its latest summit in The Hague, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said he is not in favor of Ukraine joining the organization.
“I think that an attempt to do that would essentially make it almost 100% certain that you wouldn’t be able to find a peaceful resolution to the war,” McCormick said on Wednesday evening, during a telephone town hall meeting.
Ukraine joining NATO has been viewed as a red line for Russia, McCormick said. But, he added that he views Russia as the aggressor in the ongoing war. Multiple presidents have previously expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO including presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden.
However, President Donald Trump said in February that it is not practical.
More than 150,000 Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans live in Pennsylvania, making the Keystone State home to the second largest population in the country.

McCormick, a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, also suggested that Russia may be facing more sanctions from the U.S. in the near future.
“They haven’t been willing to come to the table,” McCormick said. “They keep playing games. They seem to suggest they’ll do a deal, and then they don’t.”
“I’ve signed on(to) a piece of legislation in the Senate that I suspect we’ll introduce, if there’s not progress in the next week or two, with a number of other senators, to put sanctions back on Russia,” he added. “We’ve got to have an end to the fighting, and part of that is Russia, I think, acting in a more responsible way about a peace agreement.”
The state’s junior senator also said he supports Trump’s outlined path in reaching an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Part of that, he noted, is Europe establishing a security arrangement for Ukraine to ensure that they will be protected against future aggression.
He celebrated NATO’s decision on Wednesday to invest 5% in defense spending, which is an increase from previous years.

“We should probably increase the funding for NIH”
Referring to Pennsylvania as one of the life sciences capitals of the world, McCormick said the country “should probably increase the funding for NIH (National Institute of Health), not lessen it” as cuts potentially loom via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“I don’t agree with what the policy has been on this, and I’ve expressed that to Secretary (Robert F.) Kennedy (Jr.) and others,” McCormick said.
He was responding to a constituent’s question who was concerned about a $5 million grant, aimed to pursue a cure for muscular dystrophy, potentially being pulled.

In February, the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) released a statement condemning the proposal to limit indirect costs to 15% of all grants.
“The neuromuscular disease community depends on a well-funded biomedical research ecosystem to discover breakthrough treatments and potential cures,” Donald S. Wood, PhD, President and CEO of Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), and Sharon Hesterlee, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of MDA said. “This is why MDA strongly condemns the National Institutes of Health’s policy guidance that all indirect costs will be capped at 15% in all grants. This arbitrary decision will prove catastrophic to neuromuscular disease research, and we call for NIH to immediately reverse this decision.”
McCormick said Pennsylvania is one of the biggest recipients of NIH funding in the nation, getting more than $1 billion a year that goes towards the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), University of Pennsylvania, Penn State Health, and other large hospitals, universities and research labs.
“It’s a huge issue in Pennsylvania,” he said.
McCormick said he doesn’t believe that cuts should be made to the grants that are in midstream where progress has been made.
“In many cases, people’s lives are dependent on this breakthrough kind of research,” he said. “I don’t think it makes sense to cut grants in midstream, even if the overhead numbers look too high.”
However, McCormick said these universities need to have more scrutiny. He thinks there should be a “very organized approach” to reviewing how NIH grants are given to ensure taxpayers money is being spent on “real good science research, which in most cases it is.”
McCormick said he had a call with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya last week and said they “see a lot of common ground on this” and is attempting to have him come to Pennsylvania for a visit.

“I’m wrestling with it myself,” McCormick says about AI regulations in BBB
A provision in the reconciliation bill, dubbed by Trump as the “Big Beautiful Bill,” would prohibit states from regulating artificial intelligence (AI) for the next 10 years.
“I’m not sure where the Senate version is going to land,” McCormick said. “I think this is going to be something that we’re going to be wrestling with in the Congress for the foreseeable future, because AI is changing so quickly that we’re not keeping up with it.”
McCormick said he’s sympathetic to the provision because some states put what he called, “extreme regulations in place.”
“So, the problem with letting states independently regulate AI is that you get this mishmash of regulations that can be very restrictive to innovation and very restrictive to successful business,” McCormick said. “My view on the AI arms race is that China is our biggest competitor, and the key to winning that battle is not trying to restrict AI so much as to win the innovation game.”
However, McCormick said the work needs to provide, “clear ethical boundaries and ethical frameworks and regulation.”
“I think the biggest fear is that we’re not going to innovate enough, and if we let states start to regulate AI, we’re going to really get in the way of innovation,” he said.
However, he said in some specific areas, it becomes “really problematic.” He cited the music industry around Nashville, Tennessee.
“Country music singers are super worried about AI being used to steal their content: artists, musicians, actors, are worried about AI undermining them,” McCormick said. “So, Tennessee might want to put in specific regulation to protect their music industry.”
“So, there’s a tension here on recognizing that you need specific protections for certain types of industries, and to ensure that AI doesn’t result in kind of mass stealing of intellectual property and so forth,” he added.

(Photo courtesy Gila National Forest)One big reason the United States Agriculture Department Secretary says she wants to strip protections for 58 million acres of federal forestland is to prevent wildfires, but a new study suggests allowing roads and logging into currently protected areas will do the opposite. 
A study from national environmentalist group The Wilderness Society concluded that more roads results in more wildfires, and said “roadless” areas that comprise roughly 30% of the nation’s federal forestland see far fewer wildfire starts. 
“Building roads into roadless areas is likely to result in more fires. These fires will, on average, be smaller than fires farther from roads, but there will be more of them, and some of them will grow to become large fires,” lead author Greg Aplet concluded in a two-page summary of the study findings. 
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins unveiled her agency’s plans earlier this week during the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in Santa Fe to repeal the “Roadless Rule,” protections implemented in 2011 aimed at preserving wild forests. She said the rule hampers forest management and wildfire prevention and also said repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.

The Wilderness Society study, completed last month, is still undergoing peer review, according to the organization. Its authors, who submitted it for publication in the Fire Ecology journal, looked at three decades of wildfire ignition data across all national forests to determine whether higher wildfire frequency was found within 50 meters of roads. 
The authors determined that wildfire-ignition density was more than three times lower in areas protected as “Inventoried Roadless Areas.” Specifically, those areas saw 1.9 fires per 1,000 hectares, which is about 4 square miles. The highest wildfire-ignition density occurred in areas within 50 meters on either side of a road, the authors found, where there were 7.4 fires per 1,000 hectares. 
The authors did the same analysis by region, and found wildfire density along roads in the Southwest ranked the highest in the country. Roughly 13 wildfires per 1,000 hectares occurred in this region, compared with roughly 3 wildfires per 1,000 hectares in “roadless areas.” 
A Source New Mexico analysis of wildfire ignitions in the Gila National Forest had similar findings. 
Since 2014, the earliest year ignition data from the National Interagency Wildfire Center is readily available, roughly 1,400 wildfires have ignited within Gila boundaries, according to Source’s analysis. Of them, about 15% ignited within “roadless” areas with strict prohibitions against road construction or reconstruction, which comprise 20% of the forest area. 
Particularly in the southern part of the Gila, wildfire starts over the last decade appear to cluster alongside roads, according to Source’s map below:


The biggest fire in the Gila’s recorded history and also the second-biggest fire in New Mexico history, the 320,000-acre Black Fire, did not start in a “roadless” area, according to the Source New Mexico analysis. The Trout Fire, which is currently burning in the Gila, also did not start in the “roadless” area.
On Tuesday, United States Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz issued a statement applauding Rollins’ move to repeal the “Roadless Rule.” 
“This decision would unlock 30% of the National Forest System, enabling common-sense forest management practices to strengthen the health and productivity of America’s forests,” he wrote. 
He characterized wildfires burning in “roadless” areas as increasingly destructive, thanks to overgrown and unmanaged forests that need to be thinned and accessible. 
“The forests we know today are not the same as the forests of 2001. They are dangerously overstocked and increasingly threatened by drought, insect-born disease, and wildfire. It’s time to turn the page on the Roadless Rule and return land management decisions where they belong – with local Forest Service experts who best understand their forests and communities,” he wrote. 
By the #s: Nearly a quarter of the Gila is protected as ‘roadless.’ Those protections could be nixed

Even though the study found that wildfires tend to grow larger if they ignite in “roadless areas,” doing so isn’t necessarily problematic, Aplet, the study’s lead author, told Source New Mexico on Thursday. By definition, “roadless” areas don’t have structures or other high value assets at risk, so often little reason exists to fully suppress wildfires that burn in wild forests, he said. 
Forest managers at the Gila in particular possess skill at allowing good fires to burn in the wilderness, Aplet said. 
“The managers on the Gila at least, have allowed fires to burn on the Gila more than most national forests, and so those forests are less altered than areas that have been logged or other national forests that haven’t been similarly managed,” Aplet said. “And so when fires do burn on the Gila wilderness and ‘roadless’ areas, they have a better effect than they do on other lands.”
Aplet said the study began back in President Donald Trump’s first term, when Utah leaders were considering seeking a statewide exemption to “Roadless Rule” protections, alleging that “roadless” areas were a fire threat. 
“This didn’t sound right to us, so we looked into the numbers,” Aplet said. 
The state stopped pursuing the waiver, so Aplet’s work stopped, but Trump’s re-election prompted authors to take up the issue again, he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/7355231410_2f3cb1f481_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

New Mexico Supreme Court asked to weigh in on Tesuque wastewater conflict

In an order issued last week, the New Mexico Supreme Court set a date for arguments on July 8.
The hearing allows the justices to ask questions of attorneys, said Tom Hnasko, an attorney representing residents, with a brief 20-minute window for arguments.
At the center of the dustup is the New Mexico Environment Department’s nod for a proposed permit for plans to dispose of treated wastewater from Bishop’s Lodge, a luxury resort, and adjacent homes.
The permit allows for the discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current state permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to dispose of about half that across two disposal fields on the property.
Residents objecting to the permit coalesced into the nonprofit Protect Tesuque, which claims the disposal method threatens to pollute drinking wells downstream. Tesuque Village, with a population of about 1,000 people, relies on private wells and septic tanks.
In April, attorneys representing Project Tesuque submitted an emergency petition that claimed  the state’s process amounted to a constitutional violation by unequally enforcing limitations in liquid waste laws between smaller and larger permits.
In court documents, The New Mexico Environment Department requested the court dismiss the proceedings, saying the claims did not meet the threshold of an emergency, needlessly interrupted the permitting process and that the water was treated to exceed state and federal quality standards.
“[Bishop’s Lodge] Santa Fe has the best available technology wastewater treatment facility on site that treats wastewater so thoroughly that the wastewater can be recycled and reused… to irrigate food crops,” the response stated.
Administrative proceedings for the permit’s approval started in May, but were delayed following an order from the New Mexico Supreme Court to pause the hearings until the court weighed in.

It has a young population and large family sizes. It boasts countless family-friendly events and attractions. And family values are — allegedly — at the center of its lawmakers’ decisions.
Unfortunately, our representatives are currently in the process of advancing a federal bill that would harm the most vulnerable families in our state. Republicans’ Big Beautiful Bill proposes scaling back key tax credits on which low-income families rely to make ends meet. But it’s not too late — while the bill passed in the U.S. House, our senators now have the opportunity to make changes and protect these vital tax credits.
I’m a sociologist at the University of Utah. I have spent my career examining how policies that were never really intended to improve health do so nevertheless. These include things like food assistance, minimum wage increases, and tax credits. We typically think about how these policies affect our wallets, but they also affect our bodies. They influence whether we can afford safe housing, adequate diets, regular health care, and other basic needs that shape our physical as well as mental health.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a popular, bipartisan program that puts much-needed cash back into the pockets of working families, but it also improves their health. Research has shown that moms who received the full EITC have better prenatal care, birth outcomes, and mental health compared to moms who did not. And children in households who received the full EITC are less likely than non-recipients to experience food insecurity, behavioral health problems, obesity, and childhood abuse and neglect.
But this bill would require families to “pre-certify” the children they claim each tax year. Already, approximately 1 in 5 families who are eligible for the EITC miss out because it’s too difficult to file for it, and “pre-certification” is another unnecessary piece of red tape that will deter even more families.
Meanwhile, the Child Tax Credit, which currently provides up to $2,000 per child, has also been shown to have significant health benefits for both parents and children. The Child Tax Credit improves well-being in similar ways to the EITC by giving families’ more financial breathing room.
Proposed changes to the CTC in this bill would leave many families behind. First, it would make millions of U.S. citizen children ineligible if at least one or both their parents are not U.S. citizens. Secondly, estimates project that 163,000 kids statewide would earn less than the full CTC because their parents’ income is too low, meaning that families with the most need won’t get the full amount. In my own Congressional district alone, UT-01, a total of 33,000 kids would be left behind.
Utah state legislators have already expressed some concern about the local impact of these restrictions, which function as a sort of marriage penalty and would hit many active-duty and veteran service members especially hard.
Some argue that cutting these tax credits is fine because honest work is enough for Americans to get by. But we know this is not the case for most families. My personal experience, which motivates my own research, corroborates this.
Growing up, my father worked tirelessly to provide a decent standard of living for our family through a combination of long hours, manual labor, and sheer will. By the time I was in middle school, it had begun to take its toll; the downturn in his health was rapid. My mother’s physical and mental health likewise began to suffer as she set to filling the economic gap that had opened with my dad’s failing health. This strain marred my childhood and undoubtedly contributed to parents’ early deaths at the ages of 58 and 60.
Utah is a place that promotes the ideal that “when families win, we all win — economically as well as socially.” Our elected officials, and the people who voted them in, should keep in mind the impact of these critical programs in the service of that family-friendly agenda and the health of Utah families",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sensoryexercises-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 13:10:14.663101

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.

Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


–  – Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Five and a half years after nurses launched a campaign to restore union representation at UW Health, the state’s highest court ruled Friday that the Madison-based hospital system has no obligation to collectively bargain with employees.
Act 10, the 2011 state law that stripped most union rights from public employees, also removed legal guarantees of union representation for University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority’s employees, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for a unanimous Court.
“When we examine the statutory language along with the statutory history, it is clear that Act 10 ended the collective bargaining requirements formerly placed on the Authority,” Hagedorn wrote.
The Court rejected the argument from Service Employees International Union (SEIU) that with the Act 10 changes, the hospital authority as a corporation fit the definition of “employer” under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act.
The Peace Act defines an employee as anyone working for hire other than an independent contractor and an employer as a person — including partnerships, corporations and some other legal entities — that engages the services of an employee.
The hospital authority doesn’t automatically meet that definition, however, Hagedorn wrote.
The hospital system was spun off from the University of Wisconsin in 1996 into a new “public body corporate and politic,” the UW Hospital and Clinics Authority. The hospital system’s employees were state employees represented by unions and with collective bargaining rights under Wisconsin’s state employment relations law.
The hospital authority “is not defined as a corporation,” Hagadorn wrote, “it is a ‘public body corporate and politic.’” He cited the Peace Act’s definition of “employer” that states the term does not include “the state or any political subdivision thereof.”
The 1996 law creating the new hospital authority removed its employees from the state employment relations law and added language specifying that the hospital authority was an employer under the Peace Act.
Act 10 changed that, Hagedorn wrote — repealing the hospital authority’s collective bargaining duty that was in the 1996 law as well as all other references to collective bargaining.
“In sum, Act 10 purged references to the Peace Act from the Authority Statute,” Hagedorn wrote.
“When it created the Authority, the legislature added the Authority as an employer under the Peace Act and imposed numerous other collective bargaining provisions. In Act 10, the legislature eliminated the Authority as a covered employer along with other collective bargaining requirements. We therefore hold that the Authority is no longer covered by the Peace Act and is not required to collectively bargain under the Peace Act.”
Friday’s ruling was the final stop for a case that started in September 2022. In an agreement brokered to avert a planned three-day strike by nurses demanding union recognition at UW Health, the hospital system and SEIU agreed to a joint petition to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC).
In the petition, the union argued that the hospital should be considered an employer under the Peace Act, while UW Health argued that Act 10 eliminated collective bargaining at the hospital system. WERC sided with UW Health, and Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost subsequently affirmed the employment commission’s conclusion.

Taylor. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a preliminary victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
In Pride month, transgender Marylanders reflect on strengths, weaknesses, of state protections

“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.

In a brisk nine-page ruling, the Superior Court judge concluded that the Milton lawsuit was very similar to a previous bundle of suits fighting the multi-family housing law and should be dismissed.
The post Superior Court tosses Milton taxpayer suit against MBTA Communities law appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OPPONENTS OF A PLAN to rezone the affluent Boston suburb of Milton spent weeks urging town voters and officials to pump the brakes while a court considered a suit challenging the MBTA Communities housing law. 
All the way up to a special Town Meeting in mid-June, a set of residents, planning board members, and warrant committee members tried to hold off a proposal that would allow for the potential to add 25 percent more total housing units, required by the state because of Milton’s proximity to public transit. Less than 10 days after Town Meeting voters moved ahead with a plan to comply anyway, Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea offered another firm rebuke to the naysayers.  
The 16 taxpayers who brought suit to halt local enforcement of the controversial MBTA Communities multi-family housing law lacked standing, Gildea found. The plaintiffs also did not convince the court that the state’s designation of the town as a “rapid transit community” was unreasonable, Gildea wrote in a crisp nine-page opinion handed down on June 26. 
He rejected the taxpayers’ request for an injunction and granted the state housing office’s motion to dismiss the suit. 
The conclusions Gildea reached in a June 6 order considering a bundle of town complaints about the MBTA Communities law “apply equally here,” he wrote, reiterating that the housing law is not an unfunded mandate. The taxpayers offered only speculative costs that they would have to bear if the town complied, Gildea said. The MBTA Communities law lays the groundwork for but does not require new construction, and Milton always has the option of pursuing state grants that already exist to fund infrastructure associated with new housing, he added. 
As to the third-rail of the entire Milton debate – whether the quaint Mattapan High-Speed Trolley should count as “rapid transit” in the same way that MBTA subway lines or the Silver Line bus does – Gildea needed barely 100 words to dispense with the matter. 
In the brief MBTA Communities statute, lawmakers made no mention of the Mattapan trolley, which the taxpayers argued meant that Milton is not a rapid transit community. Rather, they said, their more distant proximity to commuter rail or Red Line subway service should make them an “adjacent community.” That designation would require rezoning for only 10 percent more units – even less than the 15 percent required for commuter rail communities. 
Gildea agreed with the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities that “the mere use of a ‘rapid transit’ category is not arbitrary and capricious simply because that category is not found in [the law],” he wrote. The specific language of an “adjacent community” is also not found in the law, he added. 
The way that the housing office created its four community categories applied its “substantive expertise” to tailor the regulations to fit the real-word conditions of each MBTA community, Gildea said, just as the state Supreme Judicial Court ordered in January. 
“For a second time this month, the courts affirmed the intent of the MBTA Communities Law, which is to increase housing production to address one of the greatest challenges facing the people of Massachusetts – high costs,” said Ed Augustus, secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, in a statement Friday. He noted that nearly 80 percent of MBTA Communities “have already said yes to multifamily housing to bring down costs for all residents, and we continue to work closely with communities that have yet to do so.”  
As the judge tasked with overseeing the many MBTA Communities lawsuits, Gildea’s Thursday ruling might yet be appealed but severely narrows the likelihood that any of the other suits before him will be positively received at the Superior Court level. As lawmakers suggested during the Milton debate, this dispute may now rest in the hands of the same legislators who signed off on the sweeping policy change in the first place.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Americans have long enjoyed the practical and romantic aspects of the West. The West has provided us with minerals, timber, energy and space to roam freely for generations. We have a wonderful asset in the West — our public lands — which are owned by the people of the United States and held in trust for us by the federal government. Anybody can go out there and recreate, for free, any time, and that is a good thing for all of us.
Congress previously recognized the value of the public lands, declaring that these lands would remain in public ownership in an act known as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management are each commissioned in FLPMA to allow a variety of uses on their managed lands. Most of the public land in the West is thus managed under a nonexclusive shared-use arrangement. Lands for grazing, mining and logging — or all three — typically remain open to the public for hiking, hunting and camping.
Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill

“Multiple use” is defined as “management of the public lands and their various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people.” FLPMA addresses topics such as land use planning, land acquisition, fees and payments, administration of federal land, range management, and rights-of-way on federal land. Local communities are empowered to ask for transfers to accommodate growth patterns.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has proposed significant changes to the manner in which public lands are sold. He seeks congressional action to bypass FLPMA and its requirements, instead claiming that the “housing crisis” can be eased if only the federal government will sell off millions of acres of public land to developers. That’s nonsense, and those proposals have drawn significant criticism for good reasons.
Previous homestead acts have done much to foster private land ownership in the U.S. Those effects are undeniably positive. But Sen. Lee’s proposal isn’t a homestead act, and it fails to take into account that the land in the West which is capable of human habitation has by and large already been claimed. There’s little water, even less infrastructure and where those shortfalls can be blunted, the cost of developing housing in those locations is significantly higher than in already settled areas. Think of the expense of drilling (and maintaining) a fresh water well for each home, along with the needs for electricity, telecommunications, solid and liquid waste, and you can easily determine that further developing wild land for housing results in costs that can’t be recovered.
Further, Sen. Lee’s proposals have not been subjected to hearings or formal input as he seeks to put them in the One Big Beautiful (budget reconciliation) Bill currently under consideration in Congress. While it’s true that the Senate parliamentarian ruled the Lee Amendment out of order with respect to that bill, Sen. Lee continues to push his proposal in the media, and in Congress. Senators Thune and Rounds have not declared their positions on his proposal to my knowledge. While maps show that South Dakota does not have any parcels for sale, Lee’s original proposal put parcels in the Wyoming Black Hills on the chopping block. Lee has since said he would alter the proposal to include only Bureau of Land Management land within 5 miles of a population center and exempt U.S. Forest Service lands altogether.
Americans need space to be free, and fortunately we have it still. We need wild spaces in America to allow for the continuation of the frontier spirit that made us who we are as a people.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court unexpectedly announced it will not rule on Louisiana’s congressional redistricting case this term, instead scheduling it for further arguments in the fall. 
The case, Callais v. Louisiana, involves non-Black voters who sued over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. Justices said they will issue an order specifying additional questions it wants addressed before they revisit the case later this year. 
“Although we hoped for a decision this term, we welcome a further opportunity to present argument to the Court regarding the state’s impossible task of complying with the Court’s voting precedents,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement to the Illuminator.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative who has served on the court since 1991 when he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, issued a dissenting statement, arguing the court has a responsibility to act promptly. 
By delaying a decision, which isn’t likely to come until next spring, the court all but ensured a new congressional map, if necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election and until the 2030 census cycle is underway.

The essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Those were my mother’s words to me as we stood in the hallway of my parents’ home in Leland in 2008. At the time, I was a 20-year-old college student, home that weekend from Ole Miss.
My mother had sensed that I had been growing distant, reluctant to talk to her on the phone, and pulling away generally from my family. She knew — as mothers often know — that to become fully myself I thought I needed to leave my family behind. I thought they wouldn’t understand.
She stopped me in the hallway and asked what seemed like a simple question: “Eric, are you gay?” In the ensuing conversation, I officially came out to my mother, who like my father, brother and sister, had known all along. Though she was not surprised by the confirmed knowledge of her middle child being gay, what she said next surprised me. “I don’t want you to have a hard life.”
I recoiled from her words at that moment. I did not appreciate the link she made between me being gay and my life being harder as a result. Knowing her work in healthcare, I did not appreciate what I assumed was her subtle link between being gay and adverse health outcomes. I wanted to believe then — as I still do now — that to be gay does not immediately equate a harder life. I wasn’t naive enough to think that life wasn’t hard, but I believed in my bones that the fact of one’s sexuality shouldn’t be a primary reason for it. I believed that to be gay was no different than one’s eye color or height: an inescapable and unavoidable biological fact.

Since that 2008 conversation, living an “out” life seems to have gotten a bit easier as reflected in national numbers. A 2024 Gallup poll found that nearly one in 10 Americans identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. All in all, in the 12 years that Gallup has tracked LGBTQ+ identification in the United States, the rate of self-identification has nearly tripled.
While there are various explanations for this statistical change, many queer people prior to this administration believed our lives would not be made harder by being who we are and living our lives openly and authentically.
These national numbers reverberate locally. Recent numbers indicate that there are 93,300 LGBTQ+ adults in Mississippi, around 4.1% of the state’s total population. Further, despite a history of exclusion, LGBTQ+ folks in Mississippi raise and sustain families.
In a 2022 article for Mississippi Today, Nigel Dent related how “the percentage of same-sex parents in Mississippi is higher than the nation at 25.7% in Mississippi versus 17.2% nationally.” In 2022, Mississippi had the nation’s highest rate of same-sex couples raising children, an inversion of statistical realities that often place our state at the bottom of lists. The unexpected fact that same-sex couples in Mississippi are raising families at such rates should be a banner of pride for our state.
Mississippi is not an anomaly in the South. In 2023, the Williams Institute found that 35.9% of all of those who identify as LGBT (the center’s chosen acronym), more than five million people, live in the U.S. Southeast, more than any other region in the country. Chances are most Southerners today know someone who is lesbian or gay or bisexual or transgender. Beyond those of us who are LGBTQ+ in Mississippi, many of us have brothers or sons, sisters or daughters, mothers or fathers, cousins or chosen kin, who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer.
LGBTQ+ Mississippians are woven into the fabric of many of our daily lives, contributing to our economy, our culture, our sense of place, our ideas of community, family and home. The rainbow connection we create is being felt across the state.
In Jackson, Mississippi Capital City Pride hosts year-round events covering the state’s queer history and culture and the Jack Myers house opened in 2024 as the first LGBTQIA+ shelter in Mississippi. Since 2008, Tupelo has hosted a Pride parade as does the Biloxi-based Gulf Coast Association of Pride.
College towns such as Hattiesburg (Pine Belt Pride), Oxford (Oxford Pride), and Starkville (Starkville Pride) also host annual pride events and year-round programming. I attended this year’s Oxford Pride, where hundreds marched in full technicolor despite changing political dynamics and institutional support. In Water Valley, Violet Valley Bookstore is one of the nation’s most revered LGBTQ+ independent bookstores and is annually featured in a graphic from Oprah Daily.
Across many fields and walks of life, we are shaping our home state, creating and making the lives of all Mississippians better, easier, more beautiful and fulfilling. Why would we want to listen to rhetoric and support policy that makes the lives of any group of Mississippians harder? Why would we want to make the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians harder? Why would you want to make your son’s or your daughter’s or your friend’s or your co-worker’s life harder? What purpose does that serve? Whose purposes does it serve?
Today politicians across the country feel emboldened to advocate to make my life and the lives of folks like me harder in this politically divisive moment. Political leaders are positioning themselves to pass legislation that would strip away rights already codified and set a foundation for further intrusion into the lives and freedoms of LGBTQ+ Americans.
The following is but a sampling of our current moment: on March 8, 2025, Donald Trump posted a crossed-out pink triangle on his Truth Social, evoking the Nazi persecution of gay men. Republican leaders in five states—Michigan, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota—have suggested the Supreme Court overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage. Idaho and North Dakota have already passed such legislation. Four additional states—Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas—have introduced legislation that would create a separate category of legal marriage called “covenant marriage,” that could only take place between a man and a woman.
On June 10, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the US, approved a resolution calling for the overturning of Obergefell as they deem it “def[ies] God’s design for marriage and family.”
Executive orders have forced the National Park Service to remove “transgender” and “queer” from the Stonewall monument website irrespective of any consideration of the historic facts pertaining to that site. Transgender flags are no longer allowed at Stonewall “officially,” though visitors continue to bring trans flags to leave at the site.
With the fate of Medicaid in limbo, some insurance companies now feel comfortable denying coverage for PrEP, or Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, a routine treatment that significantly lessens one’s risk of contracting HIV. With the defunding of the federal USAID and PEPFAR in the balance, access to HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention protocols has been interrupted globally.
As with any virus, HIV does not discriminate based upon gender or sexual identity, and an HIV diagnosis, while no longer fatal for most in the United States, does indeed make life more difficult for whoever it impacts.
Under the new leadership of Kristi Noem, Homeland Security has quietly moved to eliminate a ban on surveillance based on sexual orientation and gender identity leading many to speculate that the agency will now increase targeted surveillance on gender and sexual minorities.
Finally, executive orders, policy reversals and legislation targeting trans Americans are too many for one list to capture. Regarding the executive order against trans people serving in the US Military and using the pronouns of their choice in such service, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes called the policy “unadulterated animus.” Absolute hostility: a policy reversal that exists for no other reason than for one group to be hostile toward another group of fellow Americans.
Aren’t we better than this?
In Mississippi, some state officials continue to vilify groups of fellow Mississippians without regard for expertise or diligently consulting established facts on a given issue. Adding fuel to the flames of anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment without any grounding in evidence, such leaders strive to make the lives of a group of fellow Mississippians harder for no other reason than political utility.
What tangible benefit is there for a straight Mississippian to tell a trans Mississippian that they don’t exist? There is none. It is the politics of cruelty, plain and simple, a refusal, as Jane Fonda stated at the SAG awards earlier this year, to “give a damn” about someone different from you.
In Mississippi, only five cities — Clarksdale, Holly Springs, Jackson, Magnolia, Rosedale — and no county have passed ordinances to protect LGBTQ+ Mississippians from discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. If federal mandates are removed or held in the limbo of ongoing legal challenges, then, only 6% of LGBTQ+ Mississippians will be protected from discrimination under local law.
With recent rhetoric and proposed actions from federal and local governments, one can only imagine how the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians may be about to get harder. And to be clear, some folks within our community will be hit harder than others.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Seventeen years later, I understand now where my mom was coming from. She was coming from a place of care and concern for her child. Her words were not about who her son was but who other people were. She knew in her wisdom and experience that she would not be able to control how my life would be made manifestly more difficult by the actions of others who did not see, love and know me as unconditionally as she did. She knew people feared what they could not understand and that the so-called “marginal” among us will always be our most vulnerable.
My mother has been a healthcare provider since she was 15 years old in our native Mississippi Delta. She has often repeated a mantra attributed to Hippocrates, known best to us as the author of the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm. In a medical setting, such advice is often more idealistic than practical. Doctors and nurses must often react to extraordinary situations comparing risk and benefit for a myriad of treatments. Many treatments — such as those for cancer — often cause significant short-term harm in service of hoped-for long-term healing.
But the point is that many healthcare providers like my mother operate under the basic assumption that they should not cause further harm to their patients. That to heal, one must first aim not to make the problem worse.
I’ve been thinking in the last few months of the words harm and hard in conjunction. What if we simply told our politicians and representatives not to make it harder? No matter what you do — no matter what mistakes you may make in the process — no matter what ideological system aligns with your personal values — no matter from whom comes your campaign financing — no matter what your political party — can you first promise to not make it harder for any of us?
Can that be your first guiding principle and most basic commitment to all of your constituents? It would be nice to believe that public servants get into that line of work because they already adhere to that foundational ethic.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Life is hard. I know of few people from all walks of life who have not gone through hard times. But we should expect our leaders not to go out of their way to make it harder for any one of us.
We should hold our leaders accountable when they attempt to target any group of us in ways that will make life harder for that group and, by the way, do little if anything at all to benefit those of us who are not in the targeted, oft-marginalized, group.
As a native Mississippian, my life hasn’t always been easy. But who I am in my full authenticity has prepared me to weather the hard times and cherish the easy ones.
In March of 2025, I attended my cousin’s marriage in Pass Christian; there, she married her long-term boyfriend. The weekend after, my partner and I attended his cousin’s marriage in Georgia. There, his cousin married his long-term girlfriend. Two straight-marriages in two weekends. Good times. Easy times. Fun times. Family time.
When I was growing up, I never dreamed that the legal path for me to marry the man I now call my partner would be as easy as it has been since 2015, since the Obergefell ruling. As my partner and I watched our cousins walk down the aisle to meet their beloveds and commit to them to weather life’s storms, for better or for worse, I prayed that option remains viable for us, two men who by the grace of God found each other. I pray, too, that marriage remains a legal option for all couples like us well into our nation’s future. Life is so much easier when you walk it with someone you love by your side. Love should be enough.
In 2008, a few months after I officially came out to my mother in that hallway conversation, my older sister got married. The easiest conversation I ever had about being gay was with my sister. The conversation was easy because it never took place. My sister knew; she knows. And yet, she didn’t need me to go through the hard part — the difficult step — of having that conversation where I described my supposed difference in contrast to her assumed normalcy.
My sister made it easy because all that mattered to her is that I’m her younger brother. For her, that was, and is, enough. No need to make it any harder than that.

Federal scientists released their annual forecast for Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms on June 26, 2025, and they expect a mild to moderate season. However, anyone who comes in contact with the blooms can face health risks, and it’s worth remembering that 2014, when toxins from algae blooms contaminated the water supply in Toledo, Ohio, was considered a moderate year, too.
The Conversation asked Gregory J. Dick, who leads the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, a federally funded center at the University of Michigan that studies harmful algal blooms among other Great Lakes issues, why they’re such a concern.

bulletin_current 
1. What causes harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are dense patches of excessive algae growth that can occur in any type of water body, including ponds, reservoirs, rivers, lakes and oceans. When you see them in freshwater, you’re typically seeing cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae.
These photosynthetic bacteria have inhabited our planet for billions of years. In fact, they were responsible for oxygenating Earth’s atmosphere, which enabled plant and animal life as we know it.

Algae are natural components of ecosystems, but they cause trouble when they proliferate to high densities, creating what we call blooms.
Harmful algal blooms form scums at the water surface and produce toxins that can harm ecosystems, water quality and human health. They have been reported in all 50 U.S. states, all five Great Lakes and nearly every country around the world. Blue-green algae blooms are becoming more common in inland waters.
The main sources of harmful algal blooms are excess nutrients in the water, typically phosphorus and nitrogen.
Historically, these excess nutrients mainly came from sewage and phosphorus-based detergents used in laundry machines and dishwashers that ended up in waterways. U.S. environmental laws in the early 1970s addressed this by requiring sewage treatment and banning phosphorus detergents, with spectacular success.
How pollution affected Lake Erie in the 1960s, before clean water regulations.
Today, agriculture is the main source of excess nutrients from chemical fertilizer or manure applied to farm fields to grow crops. Rainstorms wash these nutrients into streams and rivers that deliver them to lakes and coastal areas, where they fertilize algal blooms. In the U.S., most of these nutrients come from industrial-scale corn production, which is largely used as animal feed or to produce ethanol for gasoline.
Climate change also exacerbates the problem in two ways. First, cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures. Second, climate-driven increases in precipitation, especially large storms, cause more nutrient runoff that has led to record-setting blooms.

2. What does your team’s DNA testing tell us about Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms contain a mixture of cyanobacterial species that can produce an array of different toxins, many of which are still being discovered.
When my colleagues and I recently sequenced DNA from Lake Erie water, we found new types of microcystins, the notorious toxins that were responsible for contaminating Toledo’s drinking water supply in 2014.
These novel molecules cannot be detected with traditional methods and show some signs of causing toxicity, though further studies are needed to confirm their human health effects.
We also found organisms responsible for producing saxitoxin, a potent neurotoxin that is well known for causing paralytic shellfish poisoning on the Pacific Coast of North America and elsewhere.
Saxitoxins have been detected at low concentrations in the Great Lakes for some time, but the recent discovery of hot spots of genes that make the toxin makes them an emerging concern.
Our research suggests warmer water temperatures could boost its production, which raises concerns that saxitoxin will become more prevalent with climate change. However, the controls on toxin production are complex, and more research is needed to test this hypothesis. Federal monitoring programs are essential for tracking and understanding emerging threats.
3. Should people worry about these blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are unsightly and smelly, making them a concern for recreation, property values and businesses. They can disrupt food webs and harm aquatic life, though a recent study suggested that their effects on the Lake Erie food web so far are not substantial.
But the biggest impact is from the toxins these algae produce that are harmful to humans and lethal to pets.
The toxins can cause acute health problems such as gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, fever and skin irritation. Dogs can die from ingesting lake water with harmful algal blooms. Emerging science suggests that long-term exposure to harmful algal blooms, for example over months or years, can cause or exacerbate chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems and may be linked to liver cancers, kidney disease and neurological issues.

In addition to exposure through direct ingestion or skin contact, recent research also indicates that inhaling toxins that get into the air may harm health, raising concerns for coastal residents and boaters, but more research is needed to understand the risks.
The Toledo drinking water crisis of 2014 illustrated the vast potential for algal blooms to cause harm in the Great Lakes. Toxins infiltrated the drinking water system and were detected in processed municipal water, resulting in a three-day “do not drink” advisory. The episode affected residents, hospitals and businesses, and it ultimately cost the city an estimated US$65 million.
4. Blooms seem to be starting earlier in the year and lasting longer – why is that happening?
Warmer waters are extending the duration of the blooms.
In 2025, NOAA detected these toxins in Lake Erie on April 28, earlier than ever before. The 2022 bloom in Lake Erie persisted into November, which is rare if not unprecedented.
Scientific studies of western Lake Erie show that the potential cyanobacterial growth rate has increased by up to 30% and the length of the bloom season has expanded by up to a month from 1995 to 2022, especially in warmer, shallow waters. These results are consistent with our understanding of cyanobacterial physiology: Blooms like it hot – cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures.
5. What can be done to reduce the likelihood of algal blooms in the future?
The best and perhaps only hope of reducing the size and occurrence of harmful algal blooms is to reduce the amount of nutrients reaching the Great Lakes.
In Lake Erie, where nutrients come primarily from agriculture, that means improving agricultural practices and restoring wetlands to reduce the amount of nutrients flowing off of farm fields and into the lake. Early indications suggest that Ohio’s H2Ohio program, which works with farmers to reduce runoff, is making some gains in this regard, but future funding for H2Ohio is uncertain.
In places like Lake Superior, where harmful algal blooms appear to be driven by climate change, the solution likely requires halting and reversing the rapid human-driven increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

“Every year, over 6.5 million dogs and cats and other household pets are surrendered to animal shelters” in the U.S., according to World Animal Foundation.
Although data on pet intake fluctuates, some shelters in South Carolina are currently so overcrowded that officials are reporting “crisis” levels.
Fostering, or providing temporary care for, is a great way to give pets a break from shelter life. Plus, fostering “also relieves pressure on shelters and rescues, allowing these organizations to help more pets in need,” says Pedigree Foundation.
Pets at shelters can range from puppies to dogs rescued from illegal and “barbaric” dog fighting rings. Fostering helps prepare all of them for adoption.
Fostering opportunities are available year-round.

But every June — National Foster a Pet Month — there’s a push to get more pet lovers to temporarily look after companion animals.
For years I fostered dogs. I cared for young dogs, senior dogs, and everything in between.
One of the dogs I fostered was Jeriko:. “J” loved my bathroom mat. Even though I made a comfortable space for him in the living room, he’d always return to the bathroom to lie on that mat. “J” showed me that dogs have preferences.
When he was adopted, I bought him the same mat to take with him to his “forever home.”
I also fostered Misty.
During the time I was caring for her, I asked a friend to look after Misty while I took a short vacation. When my friend came to the house to pick her up, Misty started doing “the zoomies.”
Misty was so excited that she ran in circles. She reminded me that dogs are expressive. Misty really liked my friend, and she showed it. In no time, my friend’s family fell in love with Misty and adopted her.

Then, there’s Arthur.
I first saw Arthur when I was pulling up to the shelter’s parking lot. I was returning a crate that belonged to them, and I saw a volunteer walking him back to the building. I thought, “This dog shouldn’t be here.” Arthur’s missing one of his legs.
The next day I called the shelter to see if Arthur was still there. He was. I picked him up, and he became my next foster.
When Arthur arrived home, I let him lie down on the couch and I sat next to him. He quickly got up and dropped on my lap. He showed me that dogs just want to be loved.
I quickly fell in love with Arthur and adopted him — “foster to forever.”
People frequently ask me about Arthur. Does he need a prosthetic? No. Is he ill? No. I like when people ask so they discard misinformed or preconceived ideas about dogs with special needs. Anyone who’s met Arthur knows he’s passionate about tennis balls, and he loves to run — even hop — to catch them.
Sometimes dogs who’ve spent time at a shelter are misunderstood.
Once while walking Misty, a neighbor saw us and said he couldn’t be near pit bulls. Misty’s a pit bull mix. I reminded the neighbor that breedism is a form of racism. He’d never spent time with Misty, so he didn’t know that she’s calm and affectionate. If he’d given Misty a chance, he wouldn’t have judged her just by her appearance.
Animals don’t judge us, so let’s not judge them.
By fostering and getting to know companion animals, we can inform potential adopters about their personalities. This increases their chances of getting adopted.
Saying goodbye once they’d been adopted always made me cry. I laughed and learned with them, and it was impossible not to get attached.
People sometimes said, “I couldn’t foster. It’d be too painful.” But to me it was simple. I could cry from joy that they’d found a safe and loving home. Or I could do nothing.
Fostering is flexible and varies.
There are hundreds of shelters across South Carolina, and they’ll help coordinate a schedule that works well for everyone.
Fostering can last for a few weeks or be as short as an afternoon walk. But regardless of the amount of time given, the benefits are manifold.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 15:29:22+00:00,CT Mirror,Avelo deportation flights prompt bill on jet fuel tax exemptions,Adam Walker | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/avelo-deportation-flights-jet-fuel-tax-bill/,William Tong joined a virtual press conference announcing a proposal to cut jet fuel tax breaks for airlines involved in deportation flights.,"In a growing effort to hold airlines like Avelo accountable for their role in controversial deportation flights, New York State Sen. Patricia Fahy is spearheading legislation that would revoke millions of dollars in jet fuel tax exemptions from carriers found to be violating civil liberties.
Fahy unveiled details of the proposal during a virtual press conference Wednesday, hosted by a national group called Coalition to Stop Avelo. 
The conference featured Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and advocates from across the country pressing for transparency and action against Avelo Airlines, which activists say is profiting from deportation flights contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
New Haven has been an epicenter for the boycott movement against Avelo, as the budget airline flies 30 passenger-travel direct routes from Tweed New Haven Airport, even as it’s spent the past nearly two months running deportation flights from a separate airport in Arizona.
The airline, facing financial pressures, has defended its DHS partnership as necessary at a time of increased competition to its New Haven passenger-travel business. Activists and officials from across Connecticut and the country have continued to criticize Avelo’s role in migrant removals.
[RELATED: CT faith leaders denounce Avelo Airlines as deportation flights start]
Meanwhile, at Wednesday’s online press conference, Fahy, who represents Albany in the New York State Senate, explained the rationale behind her new legislative proposal. ​“It’s leveraging our proprietary authority over public airport contracts here in New York to say that it is part of the state oversight contractual authority that airlines have to uphold Constitutional rights,” she said.
Fahy’s bill targets New York’s jet fuel tax exemption — described by Fahy as ​“very, very generous” — that saves airlines between $11 million and $17 million statewide each year. Under the proposal, airlines engaged in deportation flights that undermine due process would lose that tax benefit. 
The legislation, titled the State Airport Facilities Enforcing Accountability in Immigration Removals (SAFE AIR) Act, aims to ensure that no state agency, department, or locality in New York enters into or renews contracts with airlines that transport individuals detained for deportation without a valid judicial warrant or order from a federal judge or magistrate — not merely an administrative immigration detainer — and proof that the individual has been afforded due process rights, including access to counsel and a hearing before an immigration judge.
Introduced in May, the bill is currently under consideration in the New York State Senate’s Committee on Procurement and Contracts. It has not yet passed. 
The SAFE AIR Act would also amend state tax law to deny fuel tax exemptions to airlines that fail to meet these standards, while protecting carriers that comply with valid court orders or lawful federal mandates. It empowers the state attorney general to seek injunctive relief or civil penalties against violators. 
“This is the first private-sector contract we’re aware of between ICE and a commercial airline,” Fahy said, referring to Avelo’s alleged cooperation with DHS. ​“If they’re violating civil liberties, they shouldn’t get a break from New York taxpayers.” (Avelo has also been the beneficiary of a Connecticut state aviation fuel tax break.)
During his remarks at Wednesday’s presser, Connecticut Attorney General Tong echoed Fahy’s stance, urging states to reconsider economic support for companies engaged in harmful practices. 
Tong said Avelo refused to provide information about its relationship with DHS and instead told the state to file a Freedom of Information Act request — a response he called dismissive of a state that has offered the airline significant support. He also criticized Avelo’s claim that working with DHS is essential to its survival, arguing no business model should depend on profiting from others’ suffering.
“When I heard what Avelo is doing to immigrants and families in total violation of the law and without regard to due process — and if Avelo says, ​‘Well, that’s not us, that’s DHS, that’s ICE.’ No, sorry. You’re part of the deal, too,” Tong said.
“We are considering all of our legal options and legislative options to get more information, number one,” Tong added, ​“and if we’re unhappy with what we see and understand from Avelo, to not do business with them and not to be their partner.”
When asked about the criticism, Avelo spokesperson Courtney Goff wrote to the Independent Wednesday, ​“We recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and assert their freedom of speech. Avelo’s main priority continues to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation that over 7.3 million Customers across the country continue to enjoy.”
The press conference, organized by the Coalition to Stop Avelo, highlighted the growing grassroots and legislative movement opposing the use of commercial airlines in deportation operations. Advocates from Delaware, Michigan, Tennessee, and other states joined Fahy and Tong in calling for stronger accountability measures and the end of taxpayer subsidies for airlines tied to immigration enforcement. 
The Coalition continues to coordinate protests, boycotts, and legislative campaigns nationwide, with new local actions planned in the coming weeks to pressure airlines, investors, and public officials, including protests set to take place this weekend in states such as New York, Florida, and Michigan.

Wes Moore (D) is turning to a strategist with close ties to a potential rival in the 2028 White House election to helm his 2026 reelection campaign in Maryland – and possibly a national campaign beyond that.
Moore has hired Ron Owens, a Michigander who has worked as a political operative and statehouse aide for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) to run his reelection campaign.
Many Democrats – in Moore’s political orbit and beyond – had expected Ned Miller, who ran Moore’s 2022 campaign, joined his administration and later oversaw his super PAC, to head the reelection effort. But Miller has moved to Georgia, to run former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ 2026 campaign for governor.
“I’m thrilled to have Ron Owens leading our reelection campaign as our campaign manager,” Moore said in a statement provided to Maryland Matters. “Ron brings immense experience to Maryland from his work all across the country – with him on our team we will create the most aggressive statewide operation in history to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot all across Maryland.”
Though only 29, Owens is a seasoned operative who worked most recently as a campaign adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, helping Democratic Senate candidates, including now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), with strategy and campaign management.
In 2023, he was campaign manager to Brandon Presley, a former state utility regulator – and cousin of Elvis Presley’s – who was the Democratic nominee for governor of Mississippi. Presley ran a surprisingly strong race in a red state, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves by just 3.2 points.
Most of Owens’ political experience, however, is in Michigan, his home state. After a stint as a legislative aide to the state House Democratic leader, Owens was the deputy political director on Whitmer’s successful 2018 campaign for governor.
He spent two years as Whitmer’s public affairs specialist in her gubernatorial office, then was political director in her 2022 reelection campaign.
After Owens was hired to run Presley’s campaign, a leading Mississippi Republican cited the operative’s ties to Whitmer as a way of blasting the Democratic contender.
“COVID showed Americans that it certainly matters who serves as governor,” Henry Barbour, the Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, told the Magnolia Tribune in 2023. “Democrats such as Gretchen Whitmer advanced their elitist, government-knows-best agenda that restricted Americans’ liberty. And Brandon Presley hired her top political operative.
“Don’t believe him for a minute when he tries to persuade you he’s not of the same political persuasion,” Barbour said.
Whitmer and Moore are both seen as top-tier potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. But while Whitmer is termed out of office at the end of 2026, Moore must first win reelection next year before he can fully focus on any hypothetical national campaign.
Still, in the early skirmishing leading up to the 2028 White House primaries, Owens’ decision to cast his lot with Moore, one of Whitmer’s potential rivals, is noteworthy, if only significant to insiders.
In a 2018 interview, Owens highlighted his work ethic and life philosophy.
“One thing that my mom instilled in my siblings and me was to, one, always be kind to other people, two, always work twice as hard as anyone else and, three, whenever you’re working you should always be doing something that is benefiting others,” Owens said in an nterview with Pride Source, a Michigan LGBTQ+ publication.
“We are fortunate to have him as our leader as we seek to continue our mission to create a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said.
At this stage, Moore still has a pretty skeletal campaign operation as the 2026 election ramps up, though that is likely to change soon. But he will enter a potentially perilous campaign season without Miller, who, after guiding the governor’s first statewide campaign, became a senior adviser and director of engagement for his administration.
In the middle of last year, Miller left state government to oversee Moore’s Unity First PAC and also played a leadership role in Freedom in Reproduction – Maryland Inc., the entity that helped pass the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Moore appears to have also lost the services of his finance director, Patrick Denny, who was with the campaign since 2021.
The Moore campaign has not yet indicated who will replace Denny as finance director and it is not known who will oversee the governor’s PAC, which he largely used during the 2024 election cycle to attack Republican congressional candidates in Maryland. The PAC is now airing ads touting Moore’s economic record.
Even though he has publicly insisted in recent weeks that he is not running for president in 2028, Moore continues to behave like a possible national candidate. His trip in late May to South Carolina, site of an early and critical presidential primary, won wide attention from national political insiders and commentators.
Strategists on the popular “Hacks on Tap” podcast subsequently called Moore a “top 10” contender for 2028, and Chuck Todd, the former political director of NBC News, recently opined that Moore has the strongest resume and most gold-plated Rolodex of any of the hypothetical Democratic presidential candidates.
Moore appeared last week as a guest on “Pod Save America,” the breezy podcast hosted by former Obama administration officials. There, he explained why he’s not making plans to run for president, saying he never anticipated a career in politics and is enjoying serving as governor after starting the 2022 campaign as a relative unknown.
“I’m playing with house money right now and I love the work we’re doing in Maryland,” he said. The governor added that he will “go anywhere and everywhere” to tout the state’s progress.
 Bold-faced names

Moore’s out-of-state travels continue this month, and include a recent gathering with Democrats in Virginia, which is holding closely watched statewide elections this year.
Moore is headed to a fundraising brunch in Aspen, Colorado,on Saturday, hosted by Damian O’Doherty, the former Maryland political operative and co-founder of KO Public Affairs in Baltimore, who lives now in the Rocky Mountains but often returns to his home state.
The host committee of the event, which O’Doherty has informally dubbed “A Whole Lotta Skiers For Maryland Governor Wes Moore,” includes David Baugh, the executive director of the Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club, and a former superintendent of the Aspen School District; Rich Benenson, managing partner of the Denver office of the law firm and lobbying powerhouse Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; Gordon Bronson, chief business officer at Continuum Partners, a real estate development and financing firm; Adam Goers, a former Democratic operative with ties to former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and now the Denver-based senior vice president for corporate affairs for Columbia Care, a cannabis company; and Michael Stratton, a senior Colorado-based Democratic and corporate strategist.
Moore’s fundraiser in Colorado coincides with the Aspen Ideas Festival, the signature annual event of the Aspen Institute. According to the festival website, the confab “brings brilliant minds from around the globe to discuss the ideas that will shape tomorrow and help us understand today. From sunup to sundown, we’ll explore critical issues and uncover ideas that spark wonder.”
The festival schedule shows Moore discussing “bold, purposeful leadership” on Saturday afternoon with Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, moderated by CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.
“Big thinkers and doers share fresh ideas, challenge assumptions and ignite conversations that ripple far beyond [the Aspen conference venue],” the conference website says of the panel discussion with Moore and the other dignitaries. “Curiosity required.”
Moore is then scheduled to travel to Detroit, where he will deliver the keynote address at the Detroit NAACP’s 70th anniversary dinner on Sunday evening. That appearance was first reported by Politico.

What’s changed?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/ct-cannabis-marijuana-sales-recreational-medical/,"As sales of recreational marijuana have increased in CT, sales of medical cannabis have dropped, and overall sales have held fairly steady.","July 1 marks four years of legalized recreational cannabis use in Connecticut, and with legalization came major changes to the medical marijuana market.  
A law enacted in 2012 allowed the purchase and use of cannabis for medical reasons only. But in 2021, the state legalized recreational use for everyone 21 and older. Statewide recreational retail sales began in January 2023, and by May 2023, recreational sales accounted for the majority of state cannabis retail sales, a trend that has continued to today.
Connecticut was the 19th state to legalize recreational marijuana. 
Under state law, anyone 21 or older without a medical card is allowed to possess up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower or other cannabis product equivalent in public and up to 5 ounces in their private residence. Medical cardholders can posses up to 5 ounces of cannabis on their person.
Not only have recreational sales increased, but medical purchases have made up less than half of the state’s cannabis market retail sales since May 2023.
Both medical and recreational dispensaries sell similar products, but medical users who are using the product to treat “debilitating medical conditions” aren’t subject to the cannabis tax. Medical users can also buy other products that recreational users cannot, including capsules, tablets, pills, sublinguals and suppositories.
Medical users are also not subject to potency restrictions, while recreational cannabis is currently capped at 30% THC for cannabis flower and 60% THC products other than vapes. However, as of Oct. 1, 2025, the cap for raw flower will be raised to 35% THC and 70% THC for concentrates other than vapes.
The cannabis tax is dependent on both the product and the amount of THC; edible products are taxed the most heavily per milligram of THC and plant products the least. For an eighth of flower that’s 15% THC, for the tax currently sits at around 9.4%, fluctuating based on product pricing. Edibles are subject to a tax of $0.0275 per milligram of the product’s total THC content.
Medical card holders are required to apply for renewal annually, which involves a consultation fee with health care providers that can range from $100 to $350 for user 18 and older. For users under 18, users must have a condition specified by the legislature for medical usage as well as parental consent and a caregiver arrangement.
Because cannabis usage is federally illegal, medical card holders are prohibited from purchasing firearms, and everyone applying for a firearm is required to disclose their usage of cannabis and other federally controlled substances. Federal law bars all cannabis users from owning a firearm.
Each hybrid or recreational cannabis retailer registered in Connecticut must pay the cannabis tax, which varies by product. The state cannabis tax brought in $21.3 million in state revenue for FY 2024.
Overall, the sales tax — along with state sales tax, municipality sales tax and licensing and conversion fees for dispensaries — brought in $49.4 million in cannabis revenue for FY 2024.
While there are dozens of products on the market, usable cannabis flower, which is just the dried plant, brings in the most sales across the medical and recreational markets. Overall, in May 2025, recreational cannabis retail sales were $18.7 million. Medical retail sales were $6.6 million.
There is only one exclusively medical dispensary in the state. The rest of the dispensaries have transitioned and cater to both the recreational market and the medical market as hybrid dealers, or just the recreational market.
Statewide, there are 36 recreational dispensaries and 35 hybrid dealers. However, the number of dispensaries fluctuates. Back in January 2023, only nine hybrid dispensaries existed. Numbers from around February 2025 showed 64 dispensaries in the state— eight fewer than are currently open.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-10.15.39-AM-1024x737.png,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.
Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.
If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”
 Reaction from lawmakers

Republican lawmakers celebrated the opinion as another strike against abortions in the state. The federal ruling follows decisions by the state’s highest court upholding the state’s so-called “fetal heartbeat” law as a six-week abortion ban.
“Planned Parenthood has sued South Carolina over and over again, and over and over again, the abortion-giant keeps losing,” state Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a win for all South Carolina taxpayers, and most of all, this pro-life generation looking forward to the day when Planned Parenthood’s doors close for good.”
The opinion allows the state to determine how it spends its money without interference from outside groups, Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement.
“The Supreme Court just slammed the door on Planned Parenthood’s latest attempt to force its radical agenda through the courts on our state,” Wilson said. “South Carolina, not federal judges or D.C. activist groups, gets to decide how we run our Medicaid program.”
The decision will disproportionately affect low-income women who relied on Planned Parenthood’s services, Sens. Margie Bright Matthews and Tameika Isaac Devine said in a joint statement.
“The real price of this decision will be paid by patients, especially Black, brown and rural women who now face fewer options and greater barriers to care,” the Walterboro and Columbia Democrats said.

Still, with temperatures in the mid-90s, it was plenty hot enough for Durham resident Geneva Cearnel, her two-year old daughter and a nine-year old niece, to visit the “spray-ground” at Forest Hills Park.

“It can be blistering out here, but as long as you bring something to keep hydrated, and keep the children hydrated, it’s OK,” said Cearnel.
The trio had been at the play area for about two hours when approached for this story. Cearnel pointed to a gallon-sized bottle of water and remarked that it had been a “block of ice” when they arrived.
“A lot of people come out here to beat the heat,” Cearnel said. “Two days ago, there were some grandparents out here with their grandchildren because their AC went out and they came to the splash pad because it’s free.”
On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for most of Central North Carolina until 7 p.m. That was a downgrade from the Extreme Heat Warning in effect on Wednesday, when temperatures were several degrees warmer.
Wake County announced that temporary cooling stations across the county would remain open through at least June 30 as a response to the heat wave.
“During prolonged periods of extreme heat, it’s important for everyone to remain cautious and continue taking the proper steps to stay cool,” said Josh Creighton, deputy director of Wake County Fire Services and Emergency Management. “If at all possible, avoid strenuous activity outside during the hottest part of the day. Take breaks in the shade, or preferably in an air-conditioned space, and drink plenty of water.”
In Winston-Salem, housing activists gathered this week to demand the City of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County enact “immediate plans” to protect the county’s “elderly, children, unhoused and others without access to air conditioning from heat deaths.”
Housing Justice Now said the county’s response to the heat advisories had been “sorely lacking.”
“The only official response to the heat advisory from Forsyth County is a Facebook post stating: “be careful with the extreme heat expected this week!” Housing Justice Now said in a press release it shared earlier this week. “With conditions demanding more than a one-liner on social media, Housing Justice Now and community advocates urge public officials to do better.”
The group demands included extending the county’s public library hours and using vacant buildings such as the old courthouse and Kaledium North (a downtown museum that targets children and families) as cooling stations.
Back in Wake County, Vielka Gabriel, the season and volunteer supervisor, who oversees “Cool for Wake,” the county’s heat relief program that provides window air conditioners and fans to people who can’t afford them, said soaring temperatures this week sent demand into overdrive.

“We have lots of individuals that are seniors who have broken HVAC systems and can’t afford to get their systems fixed,” Gabriel said. “We’re also partnering with our public health department, which has been referring individuals with chronic illnesses, newborn babies that are coming out of NICUs (Neonatal Intensive Care Units).”
On Wednesday, Gabriel said “Cool for Wake” ordered eight air conditioners for senior citizens and donated six used ones to families who needed them.
“We’ve just restocked our regional centers with fans,” she said. “Yesterday alone, I’ve ordered about 150 fans.”
The fans are sent to regional centers, so residents don’t have to travel to Raleigh to get them. “Cool for Wake” also arranges deliveries of air conditioners to residents with chronic illnesses, she said.
“We’re utilizing a partnership with the Raleigh Regional Association Realtors Giving Network,” Gabriel said. “They took six requests on Tuesday, and delivered four and are delivering the other two today [Wednesday].”
Gabriel noted that residents who receive air conditioning units must arrange to have them installed.
Residents are grateful to receive fans, Gabriel said, but acknowledged that in the extreme heat the region is experiencing, a traditional box fan does little more than circulate hot air.
“This year, I’ve made a major push into getting more air conditioning units into homes,” Gabriel said. “It has been a challenge because of the cost. We have an amazing community, however, that has stepped up to the call and has been helping to get gently used units into homes.”
The Central America native has been looking into acquiring cooling units that are popular there. The units use water and ice to cool rooms, Gabriel said.
“We’re just trying to find ways that are truly effective in keeping a person cool.
In the meantime, Gabriel said residents should close curtains, lock doors and run AC units strategically to conserve energy.
This year, Gabriel said, “Cool for Wake” has worked with the Wake County Housing team to connect with the county’s westernization program to help seniors and others with to provide adequate cooling systems.
“Part of my ask would be for businesses and folks to help us get to the root cause [of why a resident doesn’t have an adequate cooling system],” Gabriel said. “If the HVAC system is the need, is there a way get donations or have [HVAC] companies come in and check units?”
Continued monetary donations are also critical, Gabriel said. And air conditioning units are no longer a luxury as summer temperatures continue to rise.
“We can get box fans rather cheaply, but if four people or five people got together and donated $25 each, it would help us be able to purchase more air conditioning units,” Gabriel said. “We really need to see the need for air conditioning units in the community.”

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)The two unions representing nearly 40,000 Minnesota state workers — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — separately announced Friday that they reached tentative agreements with the state.
MAPE members have been fuming about Gov. Tim Walz’s part-time return-to-office order that took effect earlier this month and have picketed outside negotiations between Minnesota budget officials and their union.
Under Walz’s order, state employees must work in the office at least 50% of the time unless they live more than 50 miles away or receive an exemption. Walz argues the policy will improve collaboration, mentorship and workplace culture, with the added benefit of bringing bodies and dollars back to downtown St. Paul.
The return-to-work order itself was not negotiable, MAPE said in a press release, but the union said the agreement includes a 21-day notice requirement for telework changes, up from 14 days.
“To fight off concessions in a year like this is a real testament to our members,” MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a statement. “They showed up at the table, at the rallies and at the site. This was a contract campaign in the truest sense, and our members won it.”
MAPE and AFSCME members have also expressed outrage over the state’s health care proposals, which they estimated would have raised many workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year. The administration says rising health care costs left them no choice, but MAPE and AFSCME seems to have prevailed on this point.
The tentative agreement includes “a complete defeat” of the state’s health care proposals, AFSCME Council 5 said in a press release, and MAPE said it too had “successfully fought back the most aggressive health care cost increases.”
AFSCME Council 5 also won across-the-board raises of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.75% in 2026. MAPE said it secured over 3% in across-the-board raises over the 2025-2027 contract term.
“This tentative agreement is the direct result of the incredible strength, solidarity and determination shown by our union members from every corner of our state who were determined to fight for economic justice and the public services they provide every day,” AFSCME Council 5 Executive Director Bart Andersen said in a statement.
MAPE members will vote to ratify the agreement in August; AFSCME Council 5 did not announce when their dues-paying members will vote on the agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230073-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802
,DC,2025-06-27 14:45:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-limits-injunctions-allows-trump-act-birthright-citizenship-ban,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday in a major decision reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order barring birthright citizenship.The high court declined to decide the constitutionality of birthright citizenship itself, but said the executive order rewriting the constitutional right to birthright citizenship could go into effect within 30 days after Friday’s ruling.The ruling likely could hamper other legal challenges against Trump administration actions in which nationwide injunctions are sought.In a 6-3 ruling, the conservative justices found that nationwide “injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”“The Court grants the Government’s applications for a partial stay of the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,” according to the ruling written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.While the dispute before the court related to Trump’s executive order to rewrite the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, the Trump administration asked the high court to instead focus on the issue of preliminary injunctions granted by lower courts.“The applications do not raise—and thus the Court does not address—the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act,” according to the ruling, referring to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil.The order instructs lower courts to “move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity.""More than two dozen nationwide injunctionsIn the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, through April 29, judges issued about 25 nationwide injunctions, according to the Congressional Research Service.“The lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate; we therefore leave it to them to consider these and any related arguments,” according to the ruling.A narrower injunction could refer to a class action suit.Barrett argued that a nationwide injunction would not grant more relief for barring the enforcement of Trump’s executive order against a pregnant person who is not a U.S. citizen and fears their child would be denied citizenship.“Her child will not be denied citizenship. And extending the injunction to cover everyone similarly situated would not render her relief any more complete,” according to the ruling. “So the individual and associational respondents are wrong to characterize the universal injunction as simply an application of the complete-relief principle.”Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.In last month’s oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, he said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.Origins of birthright citizenship caseThe case, Trump v. CASA, was consolidated from three cases.One was brought by immigrant rights groups and several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens who filed their case in Maryland; the second came from four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — that filed a case in Washington state; and the third came from 18 Democratic state attorneys general who filed the challenge in Massachusetts.Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.This is not the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of birthright citizenship.In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld the 14th Amendment, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, extending birthright citizenship.In that 19th-century case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had legal authority to be in the United States, such as a temporary visa. While Ark was born in California, his citizenship was not recognized when he went on a trip to China. Upon his return to California, he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.When his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, the high court ruled that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.The Trump administration has argued that the 1898 case was misinterpreted and point to a specific phrase: “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.Attorneys for the Trump administration contend that the phrase in the 14th Amendment means that birthright citizenship only applies to children born to parents who are ""subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.That would mean, under their view, people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin and therefore so would be any children they have.",,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

Read this story in English.
Los legisladores de Connecticut aprobaron en esta sesión legislativa una ley que reforma partes de las leyes estatales de protección al consumidor, añadiendo salvaguardas adicionales para quienes compran una amplia variedad de bienes y servicios.
El proyecto de ley de 33 páginas, promulgado por el Gobernador Ned Lamont a principios de este mes, fue una de las principales prioridades de los Demócratas del Senado este año e incluye cambios de gran alcance.
Amplía la capacidad de la Fiscalía General del estado para controlar la especulación de precios, exige que las empresas revelen las llamadas tarifas basura, exige a las empresas que producen dispositivos conectados a internet que informen a los usuarios si su tecnología captura y comparte audio o video desde los hogares, y más.
El Senador James Maroney, Demócrata por Milford, ayudó a impulsar el proyecto de ley, S.B. 3, en la legislatura y afirmó que ayudaría a proteger a los residentes de Connecticut en un panorama de consumo cambiante.
“Connecticut está intensificando sus esfuerzos para proteger a las familias de prácticas comerciales abusivas, ya sea mediante micrófonos en electrodomésticos, grabaciones de conversaciones o cargos sorpresa por productos engañosos que inflan sus facturas”, declaró Maroney, copresidente del Comité de Derecho General de la Legislatura.
Esto es lo que el proyecto de ley hará y lo que no hará.
Abusos de precios
Connecticut ya contaba con una ley que permitía al fiscal general del estado supervisar y procesar los casos de abuso de precios, o el aumento artificial del precio de los productos durante emergencias, como desastres naturales.
La S.B. 3 amplía la supervisión del fiscal general más allá de los minoristas, como supermercados y gasolineras. Ahora, la oficina del fiscal general también puede investigar y acusar a distribuidores, fabricantes, proveedores y mayoristas por cobrar precios “injustificadamente excesivos”.
La ley también amplió esa supervisión a los contratos de alquiler y arrendamiento.
Renovaciones automáticas
¿Alguna vez se ha suscrito a un servicio y ha olvidado que lo estaba pagando? Bueno, la legislatura de Connecticut quiere asegurarse de que reciba un recordatorio.
Parte de la nueva ley de protección al consumidor exige que algunas compañías con “renovaciones automáticas” o “cláusulas de servicio continuo” envíen a los consumidores un aviso anual indicando que se les seguirá cobrando por el servicio.
La ley también exige que las compañías informen a los consumidores cómo pueden cancelar ese contrato recurrente a través de un sitio web, teléfono o correo electrónico.
Sin embargo, este apartado del proyecto de ley no aplica a todas las compañías. Los legisladores establecieron exenciones específicas a esta norma para las empresas de gas, agua y electricidad, así como para los proveedores de servicios de internet. También establecieron exenciones similares para los bancos y las compañías de seguros.
Todos ellos ya están regulados por entidades estatales y federales independientes.
Sin embargo, los legisladores también eximieron lo que denominaron “servicios globales o nacionales” que ofrecen predominantemente “contenido audiovisual”, lo que parece incluir los servicios de streaming en línea.
Divulgación total de precios
Otra sección de la nueva ley aborda las tarifas ocultas, o tarifas basura, como a veces se les llama.
Los legisladores elaboraron un texto que prohíbe a las empresas anunciar, exhibir u ofrecer un bien o servicio a un precio que no incorpore todas las tarifas, cargos y costos que los consumidores deberán pagar.
Si dichas tarifas no se anuncian ni exhiben, o si los cargos se ocultan, se presentan de forma intencionada o se tergiversan, las empresas pueden ser demandadas en virtud de la Ley de Prácticas Comerciales Desleales de Connecticut.
Este tipo de requisito también se aplica a las propiedades en alquiler. El proyecto de ley generalmente establece que el arrendatario debe incluir cualquier tarifa, cargo o costo periódico que el inquilino deba pagar al anunciar una vivienda en alquiler.
Al igual que con las renovaciones automáticas, existen excepciones a la divulgación de tarifas.
Las empresas no necesitan detallar los impuestos federales, estatales o locales que se añaden al precio de compra. La ley tampoco se aplica en situaciones en las que una empresa no puede calcular de forma viable el costo de un servicio, como el envío, durante la compra.
Dispositivos conectados a internet
Los legisladores de Connecticut también abordaron un problema relativamente nuevo para los consumidores: los dispositivos que pueden grabar a las personas en sus propios hogares.
La legislatura, controlada por los Demócratas, busca evitar que las empresas que venden electrodomésticos, televisores o juguetes conectados a internet graben a consumidores involuntarios y utilicen esa información para sus propios fines.
La nueva ley especifica que las empresas que venden estos productos deben informar a los consumidores cuándo su dispositivo puede transmitir audio o video al fabricante o a un tercero. Los dispositivos también deben ofrecer a los consumidores la opción de desactivar dichas funciones, a menos que dicha acción inutilice el dispositivo.
Los legisladores también añadieron una sección al proyecto de ley que prohíbe que los dispositivos conectados a internet incluyan funciones integradas que permitan a las fuerzas del orden monitorear las comunicaciones de las personas.
Y prohíbe a las empresas utilizar los dispositivos para recopilar información que pueda ayudar a otras empresas a identificar al usuario para publicidad dirigida.
Maroney se refirió a estas secciones como las “disposiciones contra escuchas ilegales” del proyecto de ley.
Derecho a reparar
Una de las secciones más ambiciosas de la ley aborda el derecho a reparar, que busca garantizar que los consumidores tengan acceso a todos los materiales necesarios para reparar sus propios productos.
Más de media docena de estados ya han aprobado disposiciones similares.
La versión de Connecticut exige que los fabricantes de productos electrónicos o electrodomésticos pongan a disposición de los consumidores recursos para “diagnosticar, mantener o reparar sus productos”.
El proyecto de ley especifica que estos recursos deben incluir “documentación, piezas y herramientas”, y se aplicará a los productos “fabricados, vendidos o usados” en Connecticut después del 1 de julio de 2026.
Los fabricantes estarán obligados a poner a disposición dicha documentación, piezas y herramientas durante tres o cinco años, dependiendo del precio del producto.
Sin embargo, las empresas no están obligadas a entregar nada que se considere secreto comercial o propiedad intelectual, y el proyecto de ley no se aplica a los productos que ya no se fabrican.
Aun así, hay una larga lista de artículos que no estarán cubiertos, incluidos barcos, vehículos todo terreno, generadores, herramientas eléctricas, estaciones de carga de vehículos eléctricos, equipos de jardinería, equipos de construcción, equipos agrícolas, equipos forestales, equipos de minería y motores.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association (States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector).

The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.”
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”


Moran’s communications director, Angela Lingg, said “the Senate is continuing to negotiate any changes to Medicaid, and Sen. Moran is working to make certain Kansas hospitals are at the forefront of those discussions.”


Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.”
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.”
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association president and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients.
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation.
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent.
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.”
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”

A flurry of lawsuits is challenging the Trump administration's “slash-and-burn"" campaign, which axed hundreds of grant programs mid-stream. The White House is fundamentally misinterpreting a short phrase buried in recent regulation, the suits argue, to justify the sweeping cuts.
The post Flurry of lawsuits over Trump cuts hinge on nine words appeared first[...]","THERE WAS NOTHING subtle about the Trump administration’s approach to government spending when Elon Musk waved a chainsaw in front of a crowd of cheering activists at a February gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. The clear message from the face of the new Department of Government Efficiency: This is no delicate pruning exercise but one in which we’re felling entire trees.
The sweeping powers of the presidency give the administration plenty of running room to upend the status quo, but it can’t do that by simply reinterpreting federal laws and regulations. That’s the argument at the heart of a series of lawsuits challenging sweeping cuts to federal grants.
Hundreds of organizations across the country were notified in recent weeks that federal grants they operated – funding everything from anti-violence programs to initiatives to ensure clean drinking water – were being terminated immediately. 
The government authority to abruptly cancel millions of dollars in funding relied on the same boilerplate wording delivered to each grant recipient, usually in a short email: The award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  
A coalition of state attorneys general that includes Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell filed suit on June 24 against an array of federal offices over the administration’s use of that nine-word phrase. The “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign” rests on a fundamental misinterpretation of a short subclause “buried in federal regulations” put out by the Office of Management of Budget, the attorneys general argue. 
While this clause says that agencies can indeed terminate grants if they no longer “effectuate program goals or agency priorities,” the AGs argue that the Trump administration is fundamentally misinterpreting the meaning of this language. 
The clause does not mean that when an administration changes its priorities that organizations abiding by the terms of their grants are suddenly subjected to having the grants yanked, the complaint argues. Instead, according to the lawsuit, the wording means the grant is subject to termination if it’s determined that the recipient is not meeting the goals set out for the grant program at its inception. 
The regulatory language governing grants was put in place by OMB in 2020, but the suit claims the federal office “never once indicated that the words ‘agency priorities’ would confer broad authority on federal agencies to terminate grants based on new or changed agency priorities.”  
Rather, the suit says, the office focused on establishing program goals at the time that the grant award was made public. In other words, to ensure the continuity of their funding, grant recipients have to do what the grant said they would do. 
Yet, in recent months, programs that have been using money in the way Congress intended in authorizing the spending suddenly saw the rug pulled out from under them.  
“The results have been devastating,” the coalition of mostly blue state attorneys general wrote in their complaint filed this week. “With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived states of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more. Federal agencies have done all of this without any advance notice, without any explanation to the state recipients, and in direct contravention of the will of Congress.” 
Massachusetts housing groups, the state Department of Agricultural Resources, forestry services, public health programs, and violence prevention organizations are just some of the groups left reeling from abrupt cuts. 
In a separate suit filed in March, before the recent complaint from state AGs, organizations that fight against discrimination in housing organizations sued to “quite literally keep the lights on.” A US District Court judge in Massachusetts granted a temporary restraining order reinstating 78 Fair Housing Initiatives Program grants. 
These cuts came “arbitrarily and without notice, reason, or sensible explanation,” the housing organizations argued, and suddenly losing the funding would cause immediate and irreparable harm. 
The axe also fell on violence prevention organizations like Chelsea-based Roca, which saw a $6 million grant terminated for not being aligned with the agency priorities. Health Resources in Action, a Boston-based non-profit public health equity organization and one of the five named plaintiffs in a national class action suit, is among a group of community organizations suing the Trump administration for slashing Department of Justice grants because of changed priorities. 
In the suit, which received a hearing in federal court in Washington, DC, on Thursday, the community organization coalition argues that the use of the boilerplate language when the Office of Justice Programs ended more than 370 multi-year agreements and grants was unconstitutionally vague, exceeded the office’s authority, and did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
The group argues that the idea that the agency has broad discretion to terminate a grant already awarded because of a post-hoc change in agency position is a novel and unacceptable understanding of the grant termination provision.  
It also argues that the cuts are a constitutional violation, bypassing Congress’s appropriations authority and ignoring separation of powers. 
The DOJ is asking to dismiss the suit. The groups, it said, accuse the administration of “blindly terminating various grant agreements ‘en masse’ so that it can avoid spending congressionally appropriated funds,” adding, “These accusations are unfounded and wrong.” 
In the Trump administration’s view, the DOJ reviewed several thousand “competitive, discretionary grants” to assess whether those grants aligned with current agency priorities, deciding to terminate 376 grant agreements. It intends to reallocate those funds to “new projects that more directly advance agency priorities.” 
Along with asking that funds be reinstated, the community groups want an injunction and declaration that the DOJ’s interpretation of the right to terminate a grant based on its alignment with agency priorities is incorrect. 
In the suit filed this week, the attorneys general do not ask to stop any particular grant cut, but rather seek a legal declaration on the meaning of the OMB “priorities” clause. According to the court docket, the government has not yet submitted a response.
The Department of Justice is one of the named defendants and is representing the heads of OMB, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and he National Science Foundation. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment in an email on Thursday. 
The states and programs in question receive billions of dollars in federal funding each year, the lawsuit asserts. Beyond the funds that the administration has already attempted to cut off, there are ongoing grant programs to which the organizations are planning to apply. 
These attorneys general and the impacted organizations are worried not just about the impacts of the funds already stopped mid-stream, but also the fate of future grant awards.
Indeed, a national fair housing group filed suit on the same day, arguing that “HUD is flouting its obligation to administer a fair housing grant program established and funded by Congress.” The agency is refusing to spend appropriated funds, the lawsuit argues, cutting off its usual grant awards schedule midstream. 
HUD has not awarded any new grants or asked Congress to revoke already approved funds for these new grants, and because any funds that are not assigned by September will expire, the agency’s inaction “risks the complete loss of the appropriated funds.” 
Each of the groups and states bringing the array of lawsuits argue that the damage goes beyond even the significant funding loss, and that they are already feeling the urgency.
Attorney Lisa Newman, representing the violence prevention coalition, told US District Court Judge Amit Mehta on Thursday that the erosion of trust and damage to reputation to these on-the-ground violence prevention groups, built up over decades, “cannot be overstated.” The groups have made promises to community members who will assume that the organizations are backing away from their obligations, she said.

DCS Director[...]","The Indiana Department of Child Services investigates nearly four out of five Black families for child maltreatment. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As many as 40 employees of the Indiana Department of Child Services could lose their jobs under a reorganization eliminating three layers of management, which agency leaders said would improve communication and decision-making.
The agency protecting Hoosier children from abuse and neglect announced the changes Friday. They go into effect July 1.
  Department of Child Services Director Adam Krupp
DCS Director Adam Krupp said the layoffs won’t put children at risk because “these are not the folks on the front line.”
Instead, the employees are part of middle and upper management that Krupp is reducing so that family case managers have a more direct line to authority. Between 16 and 40 employees could be laid off, depending on if some accept new lower-paying positions.
“This is going to reduce the opportunity for communication breakdowns and it’s going to reduce the delay in decision-making,” he said. “I very much believe this will improve our outcomes in terms of focusing on child safety and working closely with families, whether it be on the prevention side or the intervention side.”
The behemoth agency has more than 4,040 employees, with almost 1,800 family case managers who handle daily interactions with children and families.
“All Hoosier children deserve a safe place to lay their head at night, and our most vulnerable kids often need an extra layer of security. Things are not working as well as they should at DCS, but we are going to change that,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “With this entrepreneurial plan, we will remove layers of inefficient middle management and bureaucracy and instead redirect resources to frontline services like foster care and family case workers to keep kids safe.”
It is estimated the state could save between $4 million and $8 million from restructuring – dubbed Project Awaken — but that money could also be redirected to child safety efforts.
DCS Regions before and after
 
Krupp talked with the ICC and went through the nine layers of employees currently in the agency, from him all the way down to family case managers. The reorganization will eliminate a level of assistant deputy directors and several others.
The state will also move from 18 different regions — each with its own manager — to five. The agency said it looked at caseloads, square mileage and staff to help determine the regions, generally aligning with a central region and four quadrants.
He noted that these regions had slowly developed their own microcultures, or 18 different ways of doing things. The streamlining will result in more consistent policies.
“Executive management, right now, we are too far removed from a family case manager, and that’s not because of geographical distance. That’s simply because of all the layers of communication, information flow and decision-making,” Krupp said.

He added the state will continue to hire family case managers, noting it’s a constant cycle of turnover and training.
“It never really stops,” Krupp said.
He said currently the agency needs between 175 and 195 more family case managers to meet statutory caseload ratios. DCS has long struggled with retention due to the stress of the job and the three months needed for training.
There was a brief move during the General Assembly session to eliminate those caseload rules, but Krupp said that is not a priority. He said lawmakers considered giving the agency more flexibility.
As part of the restructuring, the legal division will also be aligned under the new regions and work more as a co-leader with regional directors. Financial and budgeting efforts have been centralized so that there is more visibility into day-to-day spending. DCS has regularly overspent its appropriation in the state budget.
Krupp added that work toward reorganization started during the transition period after the November election. The agency in May announced new mission, vision and purpose statements and this is the second phase of reorganization.

Rodgers Health Center will provide doula services to maternity patients (Suzanne King/The Beacon).When Tristin Dockery was in labor with her first son in 2021, she only had one request: To get up and walk around her hospital room.
The nurse on duty said no.
So Dockery, then 20, stayed in her uncomfortable hospital bed as one contraction followed another. It was at the height of COVID. She and her husband were alone. And Dockery didn’t think she had much choice but to do as she was told.
“We were young and we’d never had a baby,” she said. “We didn’t know what we were doing.”
Dockery, an esthetician who works and lives 50 miles east of Kansas City in Lexington, was determined that things would be different last year when she learned she was pregnant again. She turned to the Maternal and Infant Health Center (MaIH) in Lexington.
The organization provided a doula who helped Dockery through her pregnancy and the first months after she gave birth.
“I had someone who was going to be there,” Dockery said, “who was going to help me focus on what I needed and what I wanted.”
On June 26, Altruism Inc., the nonprofit that runs the MaIH Center in Lexington, will open a second center. This one is in Kansas City’s urban Westside neighborhood.
The new Kansas City center, opening in partnership with Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center, will share space with the health center’s maternity care clinic at 2121 Summit St. and be called the MaIH Center at Sam Rodgers.
Putting doula care and other nonclinical support services in the same space with maternal health is an effort to remove a potential barrier that could keep expectant parents from getting all the services they need, said Janelle Harvey Jordan, chief operating officer at the Samuel Rodgers center.
“We’re trying to help mothers by having everything in one area,” Jordan said. Offering doula services provides “an avenue for new moms to have better outcomes.”
 What is a doula?

Doulas don’t provide medical care, but they establish relationships with patients and answer questions, give advice and offer support. They also advocate for patients, helping them communicate with their medical provider.
Studies show that the extra attention and education significantly boosts maternal outcomes, lowering the risk of cesarean deliveries by 47% and cutting the chance of preterm deliveries by 29%. Doulas also improve by 46% the rate at which new parents show up for postpartum medical checkups.
Once considered a perk only for those who could afford it, doulas are increasingly seen as an important tool in the effort to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce pregnancy-related deaths in poor and underserved communities.
In fact, last year Medicaid programs in both Missouri and Kansas began covering doula services. In its emergency rule granting the coverage last fall, Missouri’s Department of Social Services cited “an immediate danger to public health, safety or welfare of pregnant women in Missouri” as the reason doula services should be covered.
It is one of the changes Missouri’s Medicaid program has made in recent years to try to improve the state’s concerning maternal mortality rate.
According to data collected by KFF, a health policy research organization, Missouri’s maternal mortality rate between 2018 and 2022 was 24 deaths per 100,000 live births, and Kansas’ was 23 deaths per 100,000 live births. For the United States overall, the rate was 23.
But in Missouri the pregnancy-related mortality rate was three times worse for Black people than for white people. And in Kansas, more than half of pregnancy-related deaths were people who identified as racial and ethnic minorities.
In both states, pregnancy mortality reviews found that most deaths related to pregnancy were preventable.
According to the March of Dimes, more than 20% of Missouri infants were born to people who did not get adequate prenatal care. And in Kansas, the organization found that almost 17% of infants were born to people who didn’t get adequate prenatal care.
 Balancing the scales

Tonia Wright, Altruism’s CEO, is confident that making doula care available to more expectant parents will mean that more people get the care they need, and that will help balance the scales.
“In Missouri, a woman who is covered by Medicaid is seven times more likely to have a pregnancy-associated death,” Wright said. “By allowing doulas to bill for their services, it’s leveling the playing field between Medicaid-covered pregnant people and privately insured pregnant people.”
Wright, whose marketing firm, Grace Advertising & Consulting Inc., has long advised health care organizations, decided after the pandemic to form a nonprofit to help smaller health-related organizations. At first she thought she would help them with marketing and advocacy. But then she saw an even greater need and decided to tackle health disparities directly.
“The statistics in Missouri about maternal and infant health were just landing hard,” she said. “COVID had ripped the veil and really laid bare what was happening, especially for poor white women, Black women and Hispanic women. I could not escape the research studies, the news stories. So I pivoted.”
That’s when she founded the MaIH Center in Lexington.
It offers doulas for free to clients without insurance. The Kansas City center will do the same.
People who have doula care tend to have better outcomes, Wright said, because their needs are more likely met. Someone with access to government food assistance and regular health checkups — services a doula might help set up for a client — is less likely to have gestational diabetes, pregnancy-related high blood pressure and even postpartum depression. Those are all leading causes of maternal deaths.
Dockery said her doula, Shariah Edwards, helped her deal with severe morning sickness, which lasted her entire second pregnancy. She helped Dockery write a birth plan, so when she went into labor her wishes about medication and other things would already be in her medical chart.
And Edwards was with Dockery at the hospital for her labor and delivery, making sure her plan was followed. After Dockery’s second son was born, Edwards stayed by her side, Dockery said, helping her deal with postpartum depression.
“She came to my house,” she said. “She watched the baby so I could take a nap. She offered to help me clean up. And she really just sat with me a lot and talked through it all.”
 Doulas aren’t new to Sam Rodgers

Doulas are not new to the maternity care the Samuel Rodgers center provides. The community health clinic, a federally qualified health clinic, participated in a program funded by UnitedHealthcare to encourage new approaches to prenatal and postpartum care.
The center experimented with multicultural outreach campaigns, emphasized screenings to identify patients facing social barriers to care and offered patients help signing up for Medicaid, government food aid and other community programs.
The result, according to a UnitedHealthcare blog post, was a 30% increase in behavioral health and dental care for obstetric patients, a 3.6% improvement in full-term births and a 90% improvement in people showing up for postnatal care appointments.
And in 2023, the Samuel Rodgers center received a $2 million grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration to continue this work, which included offering doula care.
The health center’s new partnership with Altruism is helping extend that work again. It’s not hard to find benefits to giving patients the extra support a doula provides, said Bob Theis, Sam Rodgers’ chief executive officer.
Helping a pregnant person maintain a healthy pregnancy not only makes that birthing person healthier, it makes their new baby healthier.
“Having a good prenatal care program results in healthy birth weight babies and healthy birth weight babies bring stronger children into the world,” Theis said.
And caring for a baby at a healthy weight can cost a fraction of what it takes to care for a baby who comes into the world early or underweight. Theis said a low birth-weight baby’s care might cost 10 times more than a baby born at a healthy weight.
At least by the measure of birth weight, Sam Rodgers’ efforts to promote and improve prenatal care are paying off. Theis said the center’s percentage of low birth-weight babies fell to 5.5% in 2024 from 8% four years earlier.
Extending doula care by partnering with Altruism, he said, will add to that success.
“We’re building healthy kids in our community,” Theis said, “because one day I’m going to retire, and I want to make sure that we’re building a strong community of strong children to take care of me when I’m ready.”

Laura Kelly, left, and Kansas Department of Labor secretary Amber Shultz, right, announce the launch of the state's new online unemployment system Nov. 22, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas program aimed at preventing unemployment fraud has been caught in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The U.S. Department of Labor in May canceled $400 million in unemployment insurance grants across the country. Included within the grant funding was language that the Trump administration associated with DEI initiatives, such as studying the “equity of the unemployment system” and an “equitable access director.”
A spokesperson for the department said the cuts were “part of the administration’s ongoing effort to remove unlawful DEI programs across government.”
But at the Kansas Department of Labor, the rescission didn’t eliminate any DEI programs.
Instead, it defunded a program that implemented identity verification tools, fraud analytics and safeguards to prevent criminal attacks and system failures, which were crucial in the wake of record volumes of fraudulent claims during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amber Shultz, Kansas labor secretary, wrote a letter Thursday to U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, expressing her “deep concern and disappointment” over the federal government’s decision, which she called “both confusing and contradictory.”
“The rationale of canceling a grant specifically intended to detect and prevent fraud is, frankly, counterproductive,” Shultz said in the letter.
Kansas forfeited $1 million of the $1.7 million total without forewarning.
“Revoking this support now leaves states more vulnerable to the very threats we were all called to confront,” Shultz said.
She called the funding loss “a huge blow,” and said she anticipates that employers and claimants will feel the impacts, which could mean slower claims processes.
The termination notice the state received from the federal government reasoned that the grant “no longer effectuates the department’s priorities for its grant funding.”
Communication between the state and federal departments has been nonexistent. Shultz said in a phone call that she and department staff have been attempting to communicate with the federal department, without any response.
A statement to Kansas Reflector attributed to a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said America’s unemployment system is in an “infrastructure crisis, riddled with waste, fraud and abuse.”
The statement said the Biden administration squandered its opportunity to fix the system by focusing “on equitable access rather than advancing access for all Americans in need.”
Shultz said none of the funding for Kansas’ unemployment insurance fraud prevention grant program was used for DEI initiatives.
The federal department is fulfilling its goal, Shultz said, “if they want fraudsters to have equitable access to our funds.”
A different grant from the U.S. Department of Labor under the Biden administration, called the equity grant, gave Kansas more than $4.5 million, which the state used to ensure all Kansans could access the unemployment system. That meant focusing on rural Kansans without broadband access, Shultz said.
With the federal funding, the state fraud prevention program was able to conduct investigations and recover funds lost to fraudulent claims. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kansas and many other states faced extreme volumes of unemployment fraud, largely from international crime rings, which took advantage of aged and vulnerable claims systems. Kansas recently recovered $11 million in fraudulent claims, which totaled around 2.4% of the $460 million in state and federal funds lost during the pandemic.
The federal department’s Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office have pressed states across the country to improve fraud prevention and recovery efforts.
“Yet now we are asked to do so with fewer tools, fewer resources, and diminished federal partnership,” Shultz said in the letter to Chavez-DeRemer. “That not only undermines the substantial progress already made, but it also weakens our readiness for future crises.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/241122_unempP-01-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-27 10:01:53.693125
