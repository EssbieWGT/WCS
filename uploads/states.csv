(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Students pursuing graduate degrees in fisheries biology, aquatic ecology and related paths can apply for an endowed fellowship with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to conduct research in the Iowa Great Lakes ecosystem. 
The fellowship, named after long-time DNR Fisheries employee Edward Thelen, gives students the opportunity for hands-on research alongside DNR staff and with the University of Iowa’s Iowa Lakeside Laboratory. 
Students in the fellowship, which was funded by private donors, will focus their research on topics like fish population dynamics, invasive species management, water quality monitoring, and watershed health, according to a press release from DNR.

The Iowa Great Lakes include seven water bodies in the Okoboji region, including Big Spirit Lake and both East and West Okoboji lakes. Aquatic and fisheries research will inform conservation strategies for the area and other Midwest lake systems. 
Mary Skopec, the executive director of the Iowa Lakeside Laboratory which is located on West Okoboji Lake, said the partnership with DNR will give “graduate students unparalleled opportunities to conduct impactful research.” 
“It’s an investment not just in science, but in the future health and sustainability of our lakes, rivers, and watersheds,” Skopec said. 
Several lakes in the Iowa Great Lakes system have been listed as impaired by the department due to undesirable pH, turbidity and high levels of certain nutrients. 
Mike Hawkins, DNR’s northwest regional fisheries management supervisor, said the fellowship will attract the “brightest graduate students” to the “unique and valuable ecosystem.” 
“The Iowa Great Lakes are not only a natural treasure for our state but also a living laboratory for understanding aquatic systems,” Hawkins said in the press release. “This program ensures that future scientists will have the resources, mentorship, and access they need to continue protecting these waters for generations to come.”
Interested graduate students can apply by contacting Andrew Carlson, the fisheries biologist at the Spirit Lake Fish Hatchery, at andrew.carlson@dnr.iowa.gov.

Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, on the first day of the 2024 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate died at 1:42 p.m. Friday afternoon when Republican leaders refused to allow debate on a measure weakening the initiative petition process, GOP state Sen. Lincoln Hough said in an interview with The Independent.
A two-week special session to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional map and make it virtually impossible for voters to amend the state constitution ended Friday when Senate Republicans voted to cut off debate and steamroll both bills across the finish line. 
Hough was one of only two Republicans who opposed every motion to cut off debate and voted against the bills. 
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

About 20 minutes after the Senate adjourned, Hough said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin visited his office and removed him as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. Hough has been chairman or vice chairman of the committee since he joined the Senate in 2019.
“She said, ‘​w​e are tired of fighting with you,’” Hough said. ”To which my response was, ‘did you fight with me this week, or did I just go out here and vote no on something that was handed down to the Missouri Senate and a bunch of elected members who are not allowed to talk?’” 
It was the second time Hough has bucked his party this year when it sought to deploy procedural maneuvers to shut down debate. The first came in near the end of the 2025 session in May on bills repealing voter-approved laws expanding sick leave and protecting abortion rights. 
“What I’ve seen at the end of last session, and what I saw this week, is a dismantling of what the Senate is supposed to be,” Hough said.
O’Laughlin did not respond to text messages seeking comment on Hough’s removal as chairman or his description of how it occurred. As of Saturday morning, the change in the committee line-up had not been posted to the Senate website. 
Hough said he is not sure if he is still a member of the committee.
“I’ll be honest with you,” he said. “When the news was delivered to me, I didn’t ask a lot of follow up questions.”
The other Republican who broke with his party on Friday was state Sen Mike Moon of Ash Grove. Reached by text message Saturday, Moon said he had not been told of any changes in his committee assignments. He chairs the Veterans and Military Affairs Committee and the Select Committee on Equal Protection and DEI.
Moon, who has been punished by Senate Republican leadership in the past for some of his actions, declined to comment on the removal of Hough as Appropriations Committee chairman.
Lawmakers were meeting in their second special session of the year to do the bidding of President Donald Trump and gerrymander the 5th Congressional District to unseat U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. The Senate passed the new map first, shutting off debate after letting Democrats speak against it for about four hours.
Next came the proposal added to the agenda by Kehoe to require both a majority of statewide votes and a majority of the votes in all eight of the state’s congressional districts to pass constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
But along with the motion to take up the measure, state Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair, sent the motion to cut off debate before it began.
“My understanding of how this process is supposed to work is, if someone brings a bill before the body, then members are given the opportunity to have a conversation about it,” Hough said. “Maybe, I mean, call me crazy, but maybe even draft amendments and think about ways to improve something or change something.”
Republicans used several unprecedented maneuvers to muscle the two measures to final passage. The steps were orchestrated from the start to get the bills finished by Friday afternoon.
Then-Senate Majority Leader Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina speaks in May 2023 after passage of a $51.7 billion state budget as Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield waits for his turn to speak (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
When the Senate convened, O’Laughlin presented a new set of rules intended to sidestep every opportunity Democrats could use to stall proceedings.
As a result, no senator was allowed to introduce a bill during the special session, the daily journal was never presented to the body for approval and House-passed legislation became the chamber’s top official priority for the first time in its existence.
The procedural step to shut off debate, called the previous question, is commonly used by the majority in the 163-member Missouri House, where no member can speak for more than 15 minutes on a topic, to move priority legislation.
But until this year, it was a rare move in the Senate, where the rules allow a member to speak as long as they like on any subject once they have the floor. Invoking the rule requires a motion signed by 10 senators.
The previous question has been used to move four bills this year, twice in the regular session and twice in the special session. It was also used to implement the new Senate rules. 
But it had never before been used to pass a bill without any debate at all.
“It’s pretty easy to pass legislation in the Missouri Senate if you don’t have to talk about it, and you can just bring it before the body and say, we’re not, we’re not going to have any discussion whatsoever,” Hough said.
The Republican Party, he said, is suppressing every element that doesn’t walk in lockstep with the Trump White House. 
“It seems that if you have any independent thought, or even just raise a question, you have a problem with this Republican Party,” Hough said. “And that is not the Republican Party that, 15 years ago when I first ran for the House, that I was part of.”
His disagreement with the procedures used to pass the legislation didn’t upset the progress of the bills. Shutting off debate requires 18 votes, and the fewest on any motion was 19.
“This is a dark day in the Missouri Senate,” Hough said. “It is a dark day when policy differences lead to the dismantling of the institution and the removal of individuals from chairmanships.”
In his seven years on the appropriations committee, Hough has shown himself as detail-oriented and able to build consensus while taking a tough negotiating position during final budget talks with the House.
With one more legislative session in his term-limited tenure, Hough won’t have to worry about pleasing leadership.
The upcoming budget could prove to be the most difficult to write in many years. When Kehoe vetoed $300 million in spending items in June, the news release accompanying the action said the state budget office was forecasting a general revenue shortfall of nearly $1 billion in the coming fiscal year.
“We’re definitely,” Hough said, “going to have some conversations about the direction of the state’s finances next year.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/010324_hough1-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-09-14 09:56:16.020144

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune was hot under the collar. It wasn’t just because of the August weather, or the crowd at the Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell, or the pole barn where the crowd was jammed in. Thune was hot because of the way he’s being treated by Senate Democrats.
Those pesky Democrats have thrown up as many roadblocks as they can to delay the filling of more than 1,300 positions in the Trump administration that require Senate confirmation. “We spend two-thirds of our time on personnel in the United States Senate,” Thune said, according to a Dakota Scout story, calling the resistance from the minority party “unprecedented.”
In a recent op-ed, Thune promised that Senate Republicans are working on a rule change that should hurry the process along.
Thune anticipates ‘big fight’ in September over potential government shutdown

Gone are the days of the Senate gentlemen’s club where the prevailing tradition was that a president should be allowed to have the nominees he wanted. Thune said 90% of President Barack Obama’s nominees were approved by unanimous consent, a fast way to approve nominees that skips committee hearings and floor debate. About 60% of President Joe Biden’s appointees were approved that way. In Trump’s first term, about half of his nominees were approved without hearings or debates.
The downward trend in using unanimous consent is a direct result of the ideological split in this country. To date, none of Trump’s appointees during his second term have been approved by unanimous consent.
The irony here is that Trump can’t get approval for the people he wants to serve in his administration while, during his first months in office, he’s been busy firing or furloughing thousands of federal government employees.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sworn to use every weapon in his arsenal to block the Trump agenda. It looks like that includes slowing the Senate confirmation process to a glacial pace.
Senate Democrats may have acted more favorably toward Trump’s nominees if his Cabinet choices to be the leaders in his government weren’t so astoundingly unqualified. In Trump’s first term, he chose high-ranking officials as if casting a movie. They had to have the right look, but with the right look came a reasonable amount of competence. In Trump 2.0, the need for competence has been discarded. This time out, the prevailing quality to serve in the Trump administration is blind loyalty to the president.
There’s no doubting that the likes of Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are loyal to Trump. Their competence at running the Pentagon, intelligence agencies and the nation’s health care are frequently and rightfully questioned. Life probably wouldn’t be so tough for Thune if he and his Senate Republican colleagues had shown some backbone and told the president that competence had to be the standard for Cabinet secretaries rather than just fawning loyalty to the president.

It’s easy to understand Thune’s frustration. However, he and Senate Republicans brought this on themselves by treating Trump’s Cabinet selections as if they were serious choices rather than a presidential power play to show that he could get anyone he wanted approved by the Senate.
This space has been used before to note that Thune may come to regret, if he doesn’t already, his rise to the top Senate leadership post of his party during a Trump administration. As he complains about the long days he has to put in while fulfilling that role, he should remember that he won the office by claiming that Sen. Tom Daschle was paying too much attention to Senate leadership and not enough attention to South Dakota’s needs.
Senate Democrats may be throwing up roadblocks to Trump’s agenda, but for Republicans this is a self-inflicted wound developed by currying favor with the president rather than doing their jobs. Despite Thune’s complaints, the slow pace of approval for Trump’s nominees is likely what’s best for the country.

The scooters (about $1,400) can go 30 mph.  The skateboards (about $700) top out at 32 mph).  But following simple instructions on the web, the speed governor can be disabled allowing even faster speeds…up to 60 mph.  That modification is illegal in Connecticut.


Many adults and kids use this new gear responsibly.  Parents love them as it gives their kids mobility (meaning less chauffeuring).  But even at slower speeds these vehicles are dangerous, their riders unprotected in the event of a fall or collision. 
In July a 15-year-old in Trumbull was killed on his e-bike when he was hit by a car.
That’s why new laws are coming in Connecticut October 1 regulating these devices.
If your e-scooter has no pedals (so it’s not a moped) and a motor over 750 watts (allowing speeds over 30 mph), you’ll need a driver’s license. 
E-bikes with motors over 3,500 watts (meaning speeds over 50 mph) must be registered and insured like a motorcycle, and a motorcycle endorsement is required on your license to ride them. 


Unless the scooter is built for two seats, passengers are not allowed.  And e-bikes of all types are not allowed on sidewalks.
It is illegal to operate any motorized vehicle with a seat lower than 26 inches on public roads. That includes many of the smaller scooters and mini-motorbikes that are often marketed toward children.
Everyone on an e-bike or skateboard under the age of 18 must wear a helmet.
E-skateboards are not allowed to drive faster than 20 mph.  Riders must be at least 15 years old but the vehicles do not need to be registered if under that speed limit.  Local laws may be stricter for safety.  Best to ask your Police Department.
If all of these new regulations seem confusing or overly  restrictive, read the recent commentary by State Rep. Tracy Marra which started with the eye-catching headline… “I saw your kid almost die today”.
Increased mobility is great.  But safety must always come first.
If you’re a driver you already know how disconcerting it can be when these e-devices come hurtling along, almost silently and without notice.  But you’re the one driving a ton of steel, so give them their space.
Can law enforcement keep up with all this?  Should they be responsible?
As one First Selectman said the other day:  “It’s not a good thing to have police chasing after 10-, 11- and 12-year olds on bikes and ticketing them.  I’m not anxious to take a police officer away from other enforcement operations.”
What’s the answer, if not enforcement?  Education and parental responsibility.
There’s no way teens can afford these e-bikes on their allowance money.  They’re obviously being purchased by parents, happy to get out of squiring them around from school to dance class to the Y.  Those parents should be responsible for making sure their kids are safe… and legal.
We all love our kids, right?",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Electric_scooters.jpg,,,2025-09-14 07:56:41.156569

It’s no secret that alerts to crime victims in Vermont were full of flaws. This spring, attention from lawmakers put a spotlight on the issue — illuminating that gaps in alerts caused some victims life-altering harm. 
So, lawmakers assembled a task force to make changes to the state notification system called VINE, which stands for Victim Information Notification Everyday. 
Recently, employees at the Department of Corrections quietly made changes to VINE, which they claim will help victims and make the system more trauma-informed. But other task force members think the changes will have the opposite effect — and were left in the dark. 
“I hope that they’re reconsidering it,” said Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs. 
Crime victims in Vermont have the legal right to get timely notifications about the movement of those charged with or convicted of harming them. Once someone is behind bars, they’re entered into VINE. And victims can sign up to get VINE alerts on someone’s custody status or whereabouts via call, text or email. 
Although victim advocates in Lueders-Dumont’s department interact with the system regularly, he had no input in the changes to the platform and wasn’t formally notified until after they went into effect. 
That’s because VINE is paid for and managed by the Department of Corrections, which runs the state’s six prisons. The department’s victim specialists, along with state’s attorneys’ advocates, rely on the automated system to notify victims because they typically juggle very high case loads. 
But Vermonters have suffered because of high-stakes errors in the VINE system. 
Sometimes faulty alerts told victims that an offender was being released when they were actually being transferred to a different prison. Other times, an offender was released from prison with no notice to the victim until days later. That perpetrator sometimes came back and harmed the victim again, due to the delayed alert. 
Many victims also resent the automated nature of the notifications — with phone calls containing potentially triggering information coming from a cold, robotic voice. 
In the past, victims would get an alert if their offender was transferred from one prison to another, or if they were going to appear in court in person. 
But this summer, the Department of Corrections decided it would no longer notify victims in those circumstances. The department didn’t consult with Lueders-Dumont about the changes or let him know upfront that it was changing the system, he said. 
Jenn Poehlmann, executive director for the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services and chair of the task force, has long advocated for making the notifications customizable, so each victim can decide what types of info they want to receive. 
“The point was that this task force was going to increase options and choice for victims,” she said. Eliminating more of the platform’s services only decreases those options, she said.
Poehlmann called it “concerning” that everyone else was left in the dark. Lueders-Dumont said he wishes he was clued in earlier, so that his advocates could be aware — and make victims aware — of the change in services. 
The department justified its decision in a later memo, per Lueders-Dumont’s request. 
Jon Murad, interim commissioner of the department, explained the VINE services scratched by his department “often led to unnecessary confusion, distress, or retraumatization.” 
The notifications were “doing more harm than good,” said Ashley Fisk, a corrections Senior Victim Services Specialist, in an interview with VTDigger. “(Victims) would call us immediately and want to know specifics that we didn’t have,” she said. 
But other members on the task force disagree. 
Lueders-Dumont said his advocates are opposed to the change. “It’s not representative of the conversations we’ve had with victims,” he said. 
Victims who enrolled for VINE were told they would get the alerts that have now been discontinued, Lueders-Dumont said. Victims want to receive those updates and should be able to get them, he said. 
If a victim lives in the same town as a prison, they may not want their perpetrator living close by, he said. And he’s seen cases where victims have wanted the comfort of distance, he said. 
In turn, Cassidy Renfrew, field operations manager for the department, said that victims who have that concern could use the department’s publicly accessible offender locator online to see where someone’s imprisoned. 
Lueders-Dumont and Poehlmann also take issue with ending alerts that notify victims when an alleged offender is taken to court.
Many victims base their decision to appear in court on whether their offender will be present, Lueders-Dumont said. Crime suspects who are held in prison can tune into hearings virtually via WebEx. VINE offered a way for victims to find out ahead of time if their offender is appearing in-person in court, he said. 
There’s already been at least one instance in which a victim went to court and was surprised to see their offender in the room, Poehlmann said. 
“That should never happen,” she said. 
Renfrew argued that even without the VINE notification, victims could find out if an alleged offender is appearing in-person or virtually because the court typically decides ahead of time whether an alleged offender will appear in-person, she said. 
In the future, Lueders-Dumont hopes he finds out about any future changes ahead of time, even if he disagrees with them. “I request a formal notification so that I can distribute that information to our whole field so they’re at least not surprised,” he said. 
Lueders-Dumont asked the Corrections Department to send formal memos about any future changes. He, Poehlmann and the Corrections Department are working on a formal memorandum of understanding to keep everyone on the same page. 
True collaboration means transparency and better communication, Poehlmann said. 
“That’s what the Legislature wanted us to do for victims and survivors, and that’s what we need to do,” she said.

Why does Vermont keep choosing an all-payer approach to health care reform, as if bringing in — and regulating — the payers will be the solution?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Miriam Tatum: The current approach to health care reform isn’t working for Vermonters.","This commentary is by Miriam Tatum, of Derby. Tatum is a retired pediatrician in primary care and community hospital care for 30 years in Newport and Derby Line. She is an ally of the Vermont Worker Center.


Almost a year ago, Newport and Northeast Kingdom residents first heard that a consultant to the Green Mountain Care Board recommended converting North Country Hospital’s inpatient, emergency room and surgical services to primary care offices and an urgent care clinic. 
Fortunately, hospital leaders and concerned citizens spoke up immediately to correct the consultant’s data and to remind the Green Mountain Care Board that without a fully staffed emergency room in Newport, a resident from the Northeast Kingdom could face a one- to three-hour ambulance ride to lifesaving care. 
The hospital board rejected the consultant’s recommendation and took quick action to decrease administrative costs, improve billing services, protect recruitment and retention, and begin collaboration with St. Johnsbury’s community hospital for needed specialty care. As reported recently, the hospital’s budget for 2026 leaves inpatient, surgical and emergency room services intact, and has been approved by the Green Mountain Care Board as submitted.
Meanwhile, statewide efforts at health care payment reform, launched in 2017 as the all-payer model have not met their target goal of containing health care costs while improving population health. 
OneCare Vermont, the accountable care organization that administered the all-payer model, will shut down at the end of 2025, and Vermont plans to sign on to a new program named the All Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, with a timeline of 2026 to 2037. It would be supported with funds from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance companies. Oversight of payers and hospitals by the Green Mountain Care Board and the Vermont Legislature is expected to continue. 
Will this second version of payment reform be any more successful than the first? 
Hopefully it won’t be challenged by another pandemic with the shutdown of hospitals. But it will face funding cuts (no more premium subsidies on Vermont Health Connect) that leave more Vermonters uninsured and inevitably shift the burden of care to hospitals. 
Future funding cuts scheduled for 2027 will threaten successful Vermont programs like Dr. Dynasaur, Blueprint for Health, the Vermont Department of Health with community health workers, Support and Services at Home, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
It will be difficult to improve population health in our community without these proven cost-effective services. 
Why does Vermont keep choosing an all-payer approach to health care reform, as if bringing in — and regulating — the payers will be the solution? 
Perhaps it’s time to boldly shift our focus to insuring all people with universal health care that is state-administered and privately delivered. We are already on that path, which Vermont legislation passed in 2011 to create a single-payer system (though it was never implemented), and with Vermont hospitals already accustomed to operating on pooled funds from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurances. 
If we’re told the single-payer model is too expensive or won’t work, let’s remember that the current system doesn’t work and costs too much — not just in dollars, but in our own health and our communities’ health.

No two are quite alike. From king and queen trusses to parallelogram-shaped spans built on bends, like some on the First Branch, Gatenby has come to appreciate their variety and character.

This story by Tim Calabro was first published in The Herald on Sept. 11, 2025.
Phill Gatenby rolled over the Moxley Bridge in Chelsea with a plastic skeleton riding shotgun in his Jeep, having made the long drive from Brattleboro for an early morning visit. Just a year ago, the Manchester, England native — by way of Florida — had never laid eyes on a covered bridge. Now he’s smitten.
Gatenby recalled seeing a covered bridge while driving around and thinking, “Oh, that’s interesting. I’d never seen a covered bridge in my life before. Never really heard of them,” he said. “A couple days later, I was going to Townshend, and all of a sudden it’s the Dummerston Bridge, and I’m just like, different size, different shape, different color.”
He stopped for directions and as he got lost on the back roads, he saw more and more covered bridges.
What started as casual curiosity has evolved into a quest: visit and film all 100 of Vermont’s authentic, historic covered bridges and share the journey on YouTube in a series titled “Vermont’s 100 Covered Bridges.”
So far he’s been to 50 and cranked out 37 videos of his visits — one every Sunday.
The most recent set of episodes has focused on the covered bridges of Tunbridge, Chelsea, and Randolph.
No two are quite alike. From king and queen trusses to parallelogram-shaped spans built on bends, like some on the First Branch, Gatenby has come to appreciate their variety and character.
And, stepping back from the bridges, the entire scene fascinates Gatenby.
“I mentioned this in the Kingsbury Bridge [episode]. I was at the bridge and I looked, and you’ve got the green mountains in the background and rolling hills. Then you’ve got the farm with the — is it the corn towers? —  the river and a covered bridge. And it just says, like, you can’t get more Vermont!”
Gatenby’s process is rigorous. Each episode takes hours to shoot and edit. He gets different angles — sometimes driving through a bridge three or four times for the right shot. He’s waded into rivers, climbed steep banks, and once filmed inside a long-retired bridge that had been turned into a town shed.
“I try and do something that’s consistent,” he says. “So it’s, you know, the same start, the same middle. I go in the river. I’ve been in every single river so far.”
Gatenby credits community access TV stations — first Okemo Valley TV in Ludlow and now Brattleboro Community TV — for helping him build his skills and loaning him equipment.
“They literally brilliantly sat down and five, six, seven weeks went through how you do it,” he recalled.
Gatenby’s episodes go out via Okemo Valley TV’s YouTube channel and have regular times on the Okemo Valley and Brattleboro TV stations.
Form, Function, History
Vermont once had more than 600 covered bridges, Gatenby noted, but flooding and age have winnowed down the number greatly. Now, 100 remain and many towns hold clusters of them.
Tunbridge, for example, boasts five (Flint, Larkin, Mill, Cilley and Howe), with the Moxley bridge just over the Chelsea line. Randolph has three (Kingsbury, Gifford, and Braley or Johnson), all of them along the Second Branch.
Gatenby pointed out that three of the First Branch bridges were built by the same person, Arthur Adams. That’s a phenomenon common to covered bridges, Gatenby noted. Oftentimes the same person who had the skills to build a bridge would become the area’s go-to expert.
As Gatenby visits each of the 100 covered bridges spread throughout the state, he points out the history and construction techniques used in each, particularly the suspension methods unique to covered bridges. Most covered bridges in the White River Valley make use of modified king trusses, posts fitted into a triangle, which provide strength to the structure. Some, like the Moxley bridge, use both king trusses and square queen trusses around them.
Vermont’s covered bridges aren’t just structural relics, though — they’re cultural icons.
Some have graced the silver screen, including the Kingsbury Bridge in Randolph, used by Alfred Hitchcock as scenery in his 1955 film “The Trouble with Harry.”
“North by Northwest” has its dramatic crop duster strafing Cary Grant, Gatenby jokes in one of his episodes before cutting to a humble, scenic shot featuring the South Randolph bridge. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite as glamorous as that!”
The Chiselville bridge in Sunderland — Gatenby’s favorite so far — featured in “Baby Boom,” Diane Keaton’s 1987 film, and a year later, in the 1988 Chevy Chase and Madolyun Smith Osborne comedy, the Upper Falls bridge in Weathersfield made for a memorable gag (“I wouldn’t go that way if I were you”).
Another memorable stop is East Corinth, where the prop bridge used in “Beetlejuice” was fabricated out of whole cloth for the two weeks of filming. “Thousands of people go there every year,” he said, noting that the set-piece, used now as a shed at a ski area, doesn’t count among the authentic and historic bridges he films.
Nor, he said, does the Quechee Bridge. Though it is often mistaken for a traditional covered bridge, it’s just a facade.
“It’s concrete and steel. There’s very little wood,” Gatenby said. “You see the wood on the outside and the roof.”
Traditional bridges are completely made from wood and use a variety of truss systems to strengthen the span.
Place and Purpose
Gatenby moved to Vermont from Florida in July of last year. He now lives in Brattleboro with his wife and works as a shift supervisor at a home for adults with mental health issues.
“I’m a trained youth worker in England,” he said, having spent years working for the Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by King Charles. His day job might be demanding, but the early hours leave room for exploration.
“Three o’clock to 11:30 at night, so the daytime allows me to spend time in the TV studio,” he says. That flexibility has enabled him to squeeze in long road trips, sometimes filming six or seven bridges in a single day. “I’ve got to do minimum six, seven bridges each trip now,” he added. “To make it worth it.”
This Sunday, the show’s 38th episode will be released.
“I’m doing a little special 50th episode,” he said, noting the halfway point in the 100-bridge journey. “That’s where I’m bringing in stuff like the Quechee bridge. Because people said, ‘Oh, you didn’t go to the Quechee.’”
As the series nears its midpoint, Gatenby’s audience is slowly growing, both online and in the communities he visits.
“It’s just amazing … you know, and I’m just visiting them all,” he said, “places that I wouldn’t have got to see otherwise.”
With 50 more bridges to go, Vermont’s covered bridge guy still has miles to travel and stories to uncover.Gatenby’s series of covered bridge videos can be watched on Okemo Valley and Brattleboro public television stations or found on YouTube.

In its life at Shelburne Museum, the Ticonderoga will be repaired and replaced in parts. It will be preserved in spirit even as many of the original materials waste away.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in the Shelburne News on Sept. 11, 2025.
It was a novel thing in 1955 to move a steamboat across the land. It’s still inexplicable: deciding to sink an 892-ton boat down onto railroad freight cars in the dead of winter, hauling custom-built tracks from behind the boat up to the front as it inched across the landscape, all to make it part of a museum.
Electra Havermeyer Webb, the founder of Shelburne Museum, was big on novel ideas. Before the Ticonderoga, she already had at least eight structures moved onto the museum grounds, including a 19th century lighthouse from Colchester and a historic jail from across the state in Castleton.
It took a little over two months to move the boat, which had been chugging around Lake Champlain since it was built in 1906 at the Shelburne shipyard. It never moved more than 250 feet in a day.
“I think she instilled a lot of pride in the people that worked around her and in the endeavor of what was going on here, what she was creating. I think most of the workmen around building the museum had a great fondness and respect for her, and it takes a special leader to be able to do that,” Chip Stulen, the museum’s director of preservation, said.

Stulen has been in charge of breathing life into the Ticonderoga for almost half the time that it’s been on land. In 1993 when he was first hired, he said the boat had fallen into disrepair, although maybe not in a way that was always obvious to visitors.
“You could open up a room and you could see moss growing on the carpet, and not only that moss on the carpet, but you had ferns growing out of it,” Stulen said.
When the boat had been on water, he noted, it had an entire crew looking after it. But then, once it was a part of the museum, it had to compete with all the other structures that needed care. The project of making sure a boat, never meant to stand forever in the grass, stayed sea-worthy fell behind.
Some of the work that had been done previously had even caused further issues. Stulen said some of the patch jobs to leaks ended up causing even more condensation — when he started, guides were moving an estimated 30 buckets around the boat to catch the drips.
In the mid-1990s, the museum undertook a massive restoration of the Ticonderoga, with Stulen steering the ship (pun intended).
“We were basically taking the boat apart and then putting it back together again. So, we were opening up areas on the Ti that nobody had seen before, except for the workmen that put it together,” Stulen said.
When Havermeyer Webb had the Ticonderoga moved to the museum, it hadn’t come with a blueprint — no index of materials or list of manufacturers.
According to Stulen, preserving the ship has sometimes meant finding inventive ways to mimic its original design.
For example, a significant portion of the interior flooring of the boat is made of rubber puzzle piece-shaped tiles, their red tabs pressed seamlessly together. In contemporary times, the tiles are not just unique, they’re essentially obsolete.

Stulen had to find a company in California that would make them to order. Luckily, the museum ended up with a surplus. The tiles cover the grand staircase and the landing beneath. However, someday, the surplus will run out again.
Preservation is a continual process.
As Stulen sat on the deck of the Ti last week in one of the caned chairs lined up for visitors, a worker nearby braided in a new piece of the diamond-patterned roping that acts as a deck fence and, at one point, carried away one of the many wooden pillars holding up the ceiling for repair.
Even parts of the pillars have needed to be replaced. Stulen has worked to find similar wood, sometimes needing to repair the repairs.
“I’m continually amazed by the old growth material that was on the Ti where the grain is so tight that it has longevity to it,” Stulen said. “And even five years later, we were coming back, having to repair that.”
In its life at Shelburne Museum, the Ticonderoga will be repaired and replaced in parts. It will be preserved in spirit even as many of the original materials waste away. Preservation is about staying as close as possible to the original, but in preserving shape and material and style, Stulen is also preserving stories.
Stories of passengers crisscrossing the lake, of the advent of motor vehicles climbing ramps to board and at least one story of a very cramped elephant seeking passage.
“It’s under my skin,” Stulen said. “I remember early on, I’d stand up on the upper deck by the walking beam, and because you could see the lake at that time from there, you just sort of stood there and kind of imagined the boat moving a little bit.”
The Shelburne Museum will be holding events September 11-14 to celebrate 70 years of the Ticonderoga.

“I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, ‘If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is,’” Kurt Vonnegut entreated us. It’s easy enough to find humor and magic in silver linings as a kid; less so, as we begin reading the news and paying bills. But “silliness-in-spite-of” is a quality this week’s poet, Gretchen Wertlieb of South Burlington, might argue is essential for our wellbeing, and for a life well-lived – might even, by one definition, be translated as “resilience.”

Ode to the simply whimsical and the unnecessarily dramatic
Gretchen Wertlieb, 17, South Burlington
Ode to those who make life into gold,
who bring us some sparkle as we grow old.
Ode to the places, friends, and small things,
for which credit is unequal to the joy that they bring.

Uproariously laughing in a too-quiet room,
or dancing a tango with the red kitchen broom.
The rush of arriving in the nick of time
to catch what is gone in the blink of an eye.

Ode to the fails, the crashes, the burns,
and ode to whomever they might concern.
Ode to friends, old and new, who you’ll never let go,
ode to kindness to all, even ones you don’t know. 

Ode to novels, and stories, and handwritten verses,
long, run-on titles and believing in curses.
Ode to the feelings of heartache and loss,
ode to humanity, with all its faults.

“Cheers!” to the drama, the flair, the hurrahs,
the fainting couches, glitter, and decorative bras.
To all the outrageous, exciting, and new,
and to far too much confidence in the things that you do.

The quest of life viewed with a pair of fresh eyes
brings ambition to act and take to the skies.
Ode to the rhyme, the rhythm, the beat,
for wherever you go, that’s all you will need.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-14 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Rising costs of exchange health insurance could be major issue in 2026 U.S. Senate election,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/14/rising-costs-of-exchange-health-insurance-could-be-major-issue-in-2026-u-s-senate-election/,The rising costs of health insurance on the ACA exchange could be issue in 2026 Senate election between Democrat Scott Colom and  incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith.,"The expected rising costs for health insurance could give Democratic candidate Scott Colom a line of attack in next year’s election against incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith.
It is an issue that will hit tens of thousands of Mississippians right dab in their faces and in their pocketbooks when they go to renew their health insurance policies later this year and see how much their monthly premiums have increased.
Colom, a longtime district attorney from Columbus, can hammer Hyde-Smith for the rising costs. After all, the rising costs could be traced directly to Hyde-Smith and her allies if the Republican-led U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump do not act to prevent the increase in health insurance premium costs for about 285,000 Mississippians who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act exchange or marketplace.
Unless Congress acts before the end of the year, the price of the marketplace’s health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 annually in Mississippi, according to KFF, a national group that conducts health care research. And based on other factors, such as inflation, the increase could be significantly more.
While the enhanced federal assistance helps primarily lower income people or the working poor, the end of the enhanced federal assistance also could mean more affluent Mississippians who depend on the marketplace policies would no longer be eligible for any federal help.
During the administration of former President Joe Biden, lawmakers passed legislation to enhance the federal aid provided to people who purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. Lower income people already received some help with the cost of the marketplace policies as an important part of the Affordable Care Act, but the Biden-era legislation increased the amount of help. And under the Biden legislation, wealthier people would be eligible for federal assistance if their health insurance costs more than 8.5% of their total earnings.
Hyde-Smith, like other members of the Mississippi congressional delegation, voted against the enhanced federal assistance for the marketplace policies.
In the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill passed earlier this year, Trump and the Republican Congress were careful to ensure that the cuts to Medicaid and other programs would not go into effect until after the 2026 midterm election, when Colom is challenging Hyde-Smith.
But Congress did not take any action in the One Big Beautiful Bill to ensure that the enhanced federal marketplace assistance did not end before the 2026 elections, leaving rising health care costs as an issue for Colom and others.
Mississippi will be hit particularly hard by the end of the federal aid for the cost of marketplace policies.
Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF. Only Texas has seen a greater increase at 255%.
Unsurprisingly, the states where the participation has increased the most are all red states that in most cases have not expanded Medicaid to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor, with the federal government paying the bulk of the costs. In states where there is no Medicaid expansion, data shows that the working poor flocked to the exchange to garner health insurance.
It should be pointed out that the end of the enhanced federal assistance for marketplace policies will hurt not just those having to pay the higher premiums for the marketplace policies, but the state of Mississippi as a whole. Hospitals and other medical providers, already struggling, will be forced to provide more uncompensated care or pass those costs on to other Mississippians who do have health insurance.
Despite those health care issues, Hyde-Smith will be a heavy favorite to win reelection in Mississippi, where a Democrat has not won a U.S. Senate election since 1982.
But if Colom can connect rising health insurance costs to Hyde-Smith, that could be a powerful issue.
Of course, Hyde-Smith and the Republican Congress have until the end of the year to act and prevent people from having to pay more for marketplace plans.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28164737/3X0A6641.jpg,,,2025-09-14 07:56:41.156569

Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, 2025. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)As a licensed clinical social worker, a grassroots community organizer and public health advocate in Northeast Louisiana, I eagerly anticipated hearing U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy’s timely insights at a recent event in West Monroe. However, as a concerned voter and mother of two young children, I was not only left with my fears unassuaged, but also a spirit deeply unsettled for our nation’s health and the future my children will inherit.
Cassidy cast the deciding vote to confirm U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy after he promised to uphold vaccine confidence and scientific integrity. He has since broken those commitments, spreading misinformation, undermining public health and endangering lives.
During Cassidy’s visit in West Monroe, I asked him pointedly: “Aside from removing RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary and confirming a more competent appointee, how do you plan to protect Americans’ access to vaccines, especially for our most vulnerable babies aged 0-3 years old?”
I appreciated his initial robust response, likening fighting vaccine-preventable disease to “biological warfare.” Cassidy also said he was upset with the termination of mRNA research. It was evident how passionately he feels about protecting access to lifesaving vaccines.
However, everything fell flat with his non sequitur closing statement
“I don’t know, but I’m working on it,” the senator said.
I’m here to say: we do know, and we have coalitions across the nation who are also “working on it.” Here are a few simple ways we can stand up to the deadly disinformation sweeping our nation.
First, there is an alternative to RFK Jr.’s radical and scientifically unsound “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.
Defending Public Health has put out a report titled “Improving the Health of Americans Together.” The all-volunteer network of doctors, health care professionals, and public health advocates — not incentivized by pharmaceutical or special interest influences – promotes “an evidence-based framework for addressing the root causes of illness in the U.S.”
Thankfully, many courageous patriots are already rising to the occasion. I’m reminded of Mordecai’s words in Esther 4:14: “if you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief … will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this?”
Today’s “some other place” is the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy’s Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota. This initiative is a direct and credible response to Secretary Kenndy’s dismantling of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee, with the goal of “safeguarding vaccine use in the U.S. so that it remains grounded in the best available science, free from external influence, and focused on optimizing protection of individuals, families, and communities against vaccine-preventable diseases.”
Senator Cassidy, history will remember whether you protected the health of our people or stood silent as Americans suffered. I urge you to consider whether RFK Jr.’s continued leadership is consistent with the oath he took, as well as your oath as a physician to do no harm — and to stand on the side of truth, health and life.
I am doing all I can to give my children the future they deserve. Let’s “work on it” together.

The agency “would like to get away” from assembling panels of experts to examine and vote on individual drugs, because “I don’t think they’re needed,” said George Tidmarsh, head of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. He relayed the message Tuesday at a meeting of health care product makers and Wednesday to an FDA advocacy group.
In addition to being redundant, Tidmarsh said, advisory meetings on specific drugs were “a tremendous amount of work for the company and for the FDA. We want to use that work and our time to focus on the big questions.”
The FDA’s advisory committees were created in their current form by a 1972 law aimed at expanding and regulating the government’s use of experts in technical decisions. They’re periodically summoned for advice, including to review evidence and vote on whether the FDA should approve drugs, vaccines, and medical devices, often when FDA officials face a difficult decision.
FDA actions have traditionally aligned with committee votes. A departure can provoke controversy and public debate, as was the case with the split 2021 decision on whether to approve the Biogen drug Aduhelm to treat Alzheimer’s disease.
The FDA approved the drug despite a “no” vote from its advisory committee, whose members felt the medicine did little to treat the disease. The conflict over Aduhelm laid bare the FDA’s struggle to reconcile pressure from industry and desperate patients with its rigorous evaluation of drug risks and benefits.

Tidmarsh said the committees would still be consulted on general issues like how to regulate different classes of drugs. But meetings on specific drugs, in which experts plow through piles of studies and hours of testimony from FDA and company officials, were mainly useful, he said, because they allowed the public to see how the FDA worked.
This month the FDA began publishing the “complete response letters” it sends to companies when it declines to approve their products. Releasing the letters, which previously required filing requests under the federal Freedom of Information Act, promotes a level of transparency akin to the advisory meetings’, Tidmarsh said.
Advisory committee meetings on individual drugs “are redundant when you have the complete review letters,” he told KFF Health News in a brief interview after appearing at the health care products conference.
Former FDA officials and academics who study the agency disagree. The meetings help FDA scientists make decisions and increase public understanding of drug regulation, and abandoning them doesn’t make sense, they said.
Tidmarsh’s reasoning is “hard to follow,” former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told KFF Health News. “It’s extremely useful for people inside FDA to find out what other experts think before they make their final decisions. And it’s important to do that in a way that enables the public to understand the points of view.”
“Experts might ask questions of the company or FDA that neither of them thought of on their own,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, an associate professor of bioethics and law at the University of Pennsylvania. “The public has few other opportunities to comment about FDA decisions.”
Spokespeople for FDA and the Health and Human Services Department did not respond to repeated requests for elaboration on Tidmarsh’s comments.

Califf at times disagreed with advisory committees as commissioner of the agency and once floated the idea that it might be better if they deliberated but did not vote on products. Still, while “maybe someone can come up with a better one, I always thought it was an amazing system,” he said.
The FDA is not obliged to ask the outside experts to review drugs and usually hasn’t. It calls on them mainly for important new types of medications or when a decision is especially tricky because of high demand for a product that may have limited value, Aduhelm being a classic example.
The advisory committees are “an important resource” for the FDA, said Sarah Ryan, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. “They can play an important part of the rigorous human drug review process we have in the U.S.”
The committees are often asked to help settle disagreements within the FDA about how to move forward on a regulatory decision, said Reshma Ramachandran, a health services researcher and clinician at the Yale School of Medicine.
She and other researchers and former FDA officials praised FDA Commissioner Marty Makary’s decision to publish the complete response letters.
But the letters don’t obviate the need for committee meetings, said Peter Lurie, a former associate FDA commissioner who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
“A disclosed complete response letter tells the public that a company’s application was rejected and why,” Lurie said. “An advisory committee meeting says to outside experts and the public, ‘Here’s what we’re thinking of doing and we’d love your input before we decide.’ Plainly, those are not equivalent.”
The changes Tidmarsh described are already playing out on the ground. The FDA has held only seven advisory committee meetings since Trump reentered the White House, compared with 22 over the same time frame last year. Officials say they will now release complete response letters as they are sent, and published a batch of 89 earlier in September.
Makary has to some extent replaced the advisory committees, whose members have traditionally been vetted for expertise and biases and which are required to deliberate in public, with panels of handpicked scientists who support his views on subjects such as hormone replacement therapy and antidepressants.
Diana Zuckerman, a critic of the drug industry, attended the July hormone replacement therapy panel that considered the FDA’s black-box warning listing dangers of the treatment. Makary had wanted the warning removed and packed the panel with like-minded experts.
The event was hastily called with no opportunity for the public to review discussion materials or comment on them, she said.
“All that was transparent was that they didn’t want to hear from anyone who disagreed with them,” said Zuckerman, who leads the National Center for Health Research.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Before becoming commissioner, Makary pushed for more advisory committee meetings. In early 2022, he blasted the FDA’s decision to approve covid boosters for children ages 12 to 15 without consulting its Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Makary posted on the social platform X at the time, “It is a slap in the face to science for @US_FDA to circumvent the standard convening of the expert advisory board.”
But Tidmarsh seems to disagree.
Instead of asking an advisory committee to vote in favor of or against a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, for example, he said the FDA would be better served by a committee studying the best way to evaluate such drugs, such as which outcomes, or end points, to measure. “Is this end point correct for Duchenne muscular dystrophy? That’s an important question that cuts across many different companies,” he told KFF Health News.
FDA official Vinay Prasad canceled a planned July advisory committee meeting to discuss a Duchenne drug made by the biotech company Capricor Therapeutics. The FDA later published its rejection, or “complete response letter,” to Capricor, which then published its own letter of response to the FDA. Prasad was later pushed out and rehired with fewer powers.
An advisory committee meeting could have worked through the drug’s risks and benefits in a calmer, public, less politicized atmosphere, Ramachandran said.
The FDA usually agrees with the votes of its several dozen advisory committees. A 2023 study found that the FDA agreed with 97% of “yes” votes and 67% of “no” votes.
That’s why Tidmarsh’s comments “come as a complete surprise,” said Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, who wrote commentary accompanying the study. The FDA has postponed a lot of meetings this year, but “everyone thought it was temporary, with the transition and all the firings.”
“Another theory is that this decision is strategic,” she said, “in terms of consolidating power in the agencies so that you are no longer accountable to outside experts or the public.”
We’d like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what’s happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) WEST FARGO, N.D. — North Dakota soybean growers rely heavily on exports to China, but with harvest on the horizon, those exports are nowhere in sight. 
“China hasn’t made a single purchase commitment,” John Newton, a longtime ag economist and executive head of Terrain, a farm credit services company, said last week at the Big Iron farm show. “We need to start seeing those commitments come in right now. And I think that’s really what’s weighing on the farm economy.” 
Newton said export commitments for the crop of soybeans that is about to be harvested are at the lowest point since 2018-19, which is keeping prices low. 
Newton, who was previously the Republican chief economist for the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, said he thinks the Trump administration tariff policies have worked to the extent that there have been deals with the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other countries. “But where we haven’t seen anything yet, is with China, and where that hits hard is with soybeans,” Newton said. 
The North Dakota Soybean Council hosted a trade delegation from China in August despite the trade dispute between the two countries.

“I think it’s important to note the fact that the lines of communication are open with the buying and the selling,” German said while representing the association at Big Iron last week. “We’ve just got to get the politics out of it.” 
Farmer Mark Knutson of Fargo was part of the Chinese delegation’s tour of a North Dakota farm and grain elevator. 
“They want to do business with us, but we’re just more expensive than the Brazilian soybean right now,” Knutson said. 
Newton said it is unclear how long the Chinese can rely on Brazil to be its main source of soybeans, which it uses to feed hogs. 
He said China had built up its soybean supplies before President Donald Trump took office.
“It is feasible to think that they can get everything they need by drawing down their stocks and then purchasing from Brazil,” Newton said. “They can’t do that very long, maybe just for this crop season.” 
But China also is good at playing the long game, he said, with the Communist regime not facing the same political forces that are at play in the United States. 
“So their strategy can be a little bit different than what our strategy is here at home,” Newton said. 
Newton said negotiations may be affected by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling after it hears arguments in November on the legality of Trump’s tariff policies. 
If tariffs are ruled illegal, “it takes a lot of the leverage off the table” for the Trump administration, Newton said.

German said that China sitting out of the U.S. market is creating other changes in the soybean market. Southeast Asian countries that may have purchased from Brazil are  buying some U.S. soybeans, he said.
“Unfortunately, a lot of that product is going to be shipped out of the Gulf or the East Coast, so producers in North Dakota might not reap any benefits of it,” German said. 
North Dakota soybeans destined for Asia go through the Pacific Northwest. 
North Dakota farmers are also being affected by storms that obliterated storage bins on farms and elevators, giving some farmers little option but to take low cash prices at harvest instead of waiting for a market rebound. 
There are a couple of good signs for farmers. Newton said corn export commitments are strong and beef prices are at record highs.

The development of soybean crush plants in the region, which can take delivery of soybeans year-round, also helps make that possible. 
North Dakota saw two soybean crush plants open last year at Jamestown and Casselton. South Dakota has added crush plants, too. 
German said they are helping keep poor soybean prices from being even worse.
“They’re a godsend right now,” German said. 
In Trump’s first term, a trade dispute with China led to the federal government paying out $23 billion in relief to farmers who suffered a loss of trade because of lost exports.  
Newton said there is again talk of a similar economic “bridge” for farmers but again with many factors at play. 
Newton said some in Congress see the $66 billion targeted to farmers over the next decade in the so-called “one big, beautiful bill” as giving the ag industry the help it needs. But he said many of the benefits included in the bill, such as improvement to crop insurance and other programs, won’t show up for many farmers until next harvest. 
He said some in Congress don’t understand that those potential payoffs “are a long way away.” 
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., chairs the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee. He said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor that he is working with Sen. John Boozman, R-Mont., chair of the Agriculture Committee, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and the Agriculture Department “to find ways to support our producers while the Trump administration works to put in place better long-term trade agreements.”

“I wish I could say that stress and burnout has started to decline, but burnout continues to be high among doctors, nurses, and allied health staff working in all of our clinical settings, ranging from emergency departments and ICUs to our outpatient clinics and services. I am hopeful that one of the silver linings of COVID is an increasing focus on the men[...]","When COVID arrived, in March of 2020, Dr. Paul Hattis and Dr. Jarone Lee, a critical care and emergency medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, started a series for CommonWealth Beacon of what came to be more than a dozen interviews during the initial years of the pandemic. (You can read more here.) It has been about two and half years since their last Q&A posting. Hattis, a former professor at Tufts University Medical School and currently a fellow at the Lown Institute, decided to have a check-in discussion with Lee to see what his world is like these days and what sort of longer lasting impact Covid has had on it. This conversation has been edited for clarity. 
HATTIS: What has happened to inpatient volumes, including ICU volumes since the Covid era peak? 
LEE: Overall, at MGB [Mass General Brigham], ever since COVID arrived, our emergency department, inpatient, and ICU units continue to run persistently high volumes, both at our academic centers and community hospitals. Previously, on the ICU side, high volume months were often more predictable, with summer bringing higher numbers of trauma patients, and wintertime often with higher respiratory virus cases. However, these days, we continuously have a high volume of high-acuity patients year-round.  I think a key contributing factor is that many of the smaller hospitals have less staffed beds and reduced ability to care for very sick patients.  
I do believe this is worse since the pandemic, and the accompanying era of rising health care supply and labor costs, nursing shortages, and difficulty keeping needed subspecialists on staff. For example, at many hospitals, if a patient arrives at a hospital without a neurosurgeon and has a head injury with blood around the brain, they will need to transfer to a system like ours.  
HATTIS: What would you say has happened with stress and burnout in the last couple of years? Is it better than things were during the height of Covid? 
LEE: I wish I could say that stress and burnout has started to decline, but burnout continues to be high among doctors, nurses, and allied health staff working in all of our clinical settings, ranging from emergency departments and ICUs to our outpatient clinics and services. I am hopeful that one of the silver linings of COVID is an increasing focus on the mental health of health care workers. I do feel like there has been a more concerted effort to figure out how to make things better – despite knowing that there is a need for a wide variety of strategies to address the problem. 
Another good sign is that I recently encountered a new starting group of residents in the ICU who were not yet exposed to intense Covid care situations during their clinical training years. Why I bring this up is that they were all extremely energetic, engaged in learning about medicine [and] the hospital, and in exploring what happened during the initial years of the Covid era. I am excited to follow their journeys, and I believe their high energy and interest will continue to help with the overall environment. 
HATTIS: Of course, people still get Covid infections today and get hospitalized. Some are very ill. Do survival rates of ICU patients with Covid seem any different now than when you had many cases? 
LEE: People continue to get Covid, and we continue to have patients that get admitted to the hospital and the ICU with COVID-related complications, including respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. As a medical community, we learned a ton about how to treat not only Covid, but diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which you can get from COVID. Similarly, we learned an incredible amount about how to use advanced, non-invasive oxygenation devices, such as high-flow nasal cannulas, safely and effectively to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. COVID continues to have lingering effects, including many patients with long COVID, who continue to suffer a wide variety of symptoms.  
HATTIS: Do you have any specific concerns going into this next winter respiratory viral season? 
LEE: Traditionally, flu season occurred near winter, and we saw an uptick of flu cases in the hospital and in our ICUs; however, this last year, we noticed a second peak around February. The reasons are unclear, but we do know that flu, COVID , and other respiratory diseases continue to cause critical illness in patients requiring admission to the ICUs. As strongly suggested by groups such as the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics,  I would reinforce the need to get annual vaccinations as that helps protect our patients from the uncommon – but very real – chance of dying from the flu or other viruses. This is especially true for our elderly, young, and immunosuppressed, such as cancer patients. 
HATTIS: The affordability challenges of US health care are significant and ubiquitous across our country and in our state.   One hope to make some progress here is to reduce the operational expense growth faced by our health care providers.   There is a lot of hype and hope that the uses of artificial intelligence can bring real and meaningful savings to health care operations.  From a bedside clinician’s perspective, are there any tangible examples you can point to right now of how AI is already helping to save money and what sort of hopes do you have for it going forward into the future? 
LEE: AI is everywhere. I cannot go through a day at the hospital without someone, patient or colleague, bringing up AI and how it is changing health care. I fully agree with your sentiment that AI, deployed properly and with the correct guardrails, will lead to much better patient outcomes, improved back-of-house processes, and,  hopefully, greatly reduce much of the busy work that leads to burnout and stress.  
For example, across MGB, we recently deployed an AI-based documentation system that supports one of the most painful parts of my personal workflow – writing patient notes. While I love the HBO TV show “The  Pitt” and how medically accurate it is to our clinical lives, what my colleagues and I joke about is that the clinicians in the show are not seen doing the many hours of documentation required for the vast numbers of patients they see.  Employing AI to help clinicians with their documentation burden by listening to our conversations with patients and then generating a note that we can review and modify after a patient encounter is already starting to be a time game-changer, and only one of many opportunities for AI in the health care space.  
HATTIS: You are also leading on some of MGB’s international partnerships, in particular you’re working to build a hospital in a part of the UAE that lacks health care facilities. You also continue, through your volunteer efforts, to try to support health care workers in Ukraine and other places through telehealth. Any reflections from these efforts that you think would be of interest to a Massachusetts audience?  
LEE: Yes, I lead a project where we are supporting the build of a new hospital in a rural and underserved area of the UAE. It’s an incredible project that I am excited about both in terms of mission and breadth as we are working with an incredible local partner. Similarly, the non-profit that I volunteer with primarily, Health Tech Without Borders, continues to serve and offer support in needed countries, with a good amount of effort in Ukraine. We recently deployed a new telehealth system to Dnipro, in Eastern Ukraine, near the front lines. It has already started helping to reduce the number of children needing to be transported — avoiding more danger for these kids needing to travel between hospitals. 
Interestingly, during a recent check-in with the Dnipro team, they shared that with the recent uptick in attacks in Western Ukraine, they are now supporting traumatically injured kids in Kyiv as they have had much more experience within Dnipro. What is even more interesting is that they have been using the system to support telehealth, outpatient visits for their regular population of patients, across all specialties from pediatrics to cardiology and more. This just shows how telehealth is the future and can scale rapidly even in conflict zones.  
HATTIS: During the height of the pandemic, we also talked about how your family was doing – especially your then-5-year-old son – while you were devoting enormously long days to the frontlines of patient care. How’s your family doing these days? 
LEE: Thank you for asking. My family is doing well. Our son enjoyed his time out of school this summer. He is now his own person with his own personality and knows what gets me. I always know when he is mad at me because he will tell me that my jokes are not funny.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-14 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Drug overdoses in CT prisons raising alarms,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/14/drug-overdoses-in-ct-prisons-raising-alarms/,The number of overdoses reflects the challenge facing the DOC: keeping illegal drugs out of CT prisons and treating addiction within them.,"On July 21, Tracy Ciccone got a call from the warden at Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown. Her son, 32-year-old Tyler Cole, was being held in the facility awaiting trial. She said she expected the call to be about some kind of “little ruckus” that her son had caused at the facility. 
Instead, the warden told her that, hours earlier, Cole had been found dead. 
She said she barely remembers what happened after that. “I must have yelled or something, because I remember [my husband] Jason running down the hall and picking me up off the ground,” she said.
Cole is one of 15 people who have died from overdoses while in custody of the Department of Correction since 2023, according to information from the state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The overdoses were from a range of drugs — prescribed and not — including fentanyl, cocaine, xylazine, synthetic cannabis, methadone and antipsychotic medications. They died in prisons, at hospitals, in halfway houses, and in their own bedrooms while on parole. 
After three fatal accidental overdoses in 2023, there were nine in 2024. In 2025, there had been three through July, according to the OCME data.
Nonfatal overdoses are also on the rise within the DOC. In recent months, the number of emergency calls for overdoses at prison facilities has increased notably — including an increase of about 30% in Somers, home of Osborn Correctional Institute.  
According to DOC data provided to the correction officers’ union and shared with the Connecticut Mirror, the number of ambulance calls to Osborn for “drug-related incidents” jumped from 16 in 2024 to 41 in the first half of 2025. At Cheshire Correctional Institute, there were 18 ambulance calls for drug-related concerns in all of 2024; that rose to 19 in the first half of 2025.
Data from the state Department of Correction obtained through an FOI request shows 74 “suspected overdoses” across 11 facilities from January through July 2025. More than a third took place at Osborn. 
The number of overdoses and overdose deaths reflects the intractable, overlapping challenges facing the Department of Correction: keeping illegal drugs out of state prisons and adequately treating addiction within them. 
Nearly three quarters of the state’s prison population struggles with substance abuse and needs treatment, according to a 2023 report from the Connecticut Sentencing Commission. For incarcerated women, the proportion was even higher. The same report found that a third of incarcerated people have mental health disorders that require treatment. A quarter of incarcerated people have both mental health and substance abuse disorders.
Drugs coming in
A drug known as K2 is the latest substance to vex correctional staff and threaten the lives of individuals in custody. Prisons around the country are struggling to keep it out. The mixture of chemicals, often bug sprays, with other drugs like marijuana and tobacco — which people then smoke — is difficult to track because it can enter prisons on pieces of paper. 
A formerly incarcerated person at Osborn Correctional Institution told CT Mirror he had seen inmates in his cell block smoking K2 by using a battery and a wire to ignite the paper and then inhaling the smoke using a pen cap or pen tube. 
“I have personally witnessed inmates rip their cell apart, hide under their bed while attempting to dig into the concrete floor, vomit uncontrollably, roll around and tossing on their bunk, become agitated and out-of-control and have to be sprayed with Mace and restrained, strip naked and feel hot or overheated, while others have passed out, fainted or became unconscious,” he wrote in a letter. 
The formerly incarcerated individual, who asked not to be named in this story over fear of retaliation, told CT Mirror that he’d seen correction officers ignore the presence of contraband in the facility, walk past inmates who were high and warn incarcerated people when officers would be coming to search their cells. 
But officers told CT Mirror that the presence of K2 is frustrating them, too. Rudy Demiraj, a representative for the correction officers union, said the presence of K2 was causing a “dangerous and volatile environment” inside the prisons. 
“I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Demiraj said, referring to K2. “I would say this is an epidemic.” As yet, no one has died of a K2 overdose in custody in Connecticut.
Joseph McCarley, a corrections officer at Cheshire Correctional Institute, said the overdoses had increased to a point where they were happening multiple times per day. If the incarcerated person was sent to the hospital, that meant officers would have to leave the already short-staffed facility, which could mean a partial or full facility lockdown, leaving incarcerated people unable to participate in activities.
“ It results in, a lot of times, facilities needing to deploy staff to handle these emergencies where they would otherwise be monitoring the inmate population,” Demiraj said. 
Demiraj said claims that officers were ignoring contraband and overdoses were “baseless” but said staff might be so overwhelmed dealing with the drug usage that they were being pulled away from normal inspections and other duties.
The power of the street drugs has dramatically increased over the past, say, 10 years.Former inspector general Robert Devlin
Other drugs, including fentanyl, are also finding their way inside. 
Ashley Morin died last August from an overdose of fentanyl mixed with other strong opioids. Morin, who was 32 years old and had just given birth, had only been in York Correctional Institution in East Lyme a few days after being arrested for violating a protective order. 
According to the Inspector General’s report, Morin said she was offered fentanyl by her cellmates before moving to a different cell. Officers who searched the cell found what they believed to be drugs, but the material later tested negative in a laboratory analysis. 
Former Inspector General Robert Devlin said that since Morin had entered the facility only a few days before her death, it was possible she’d managed to bring the drugs with her into the prison. He said he was aware of other cases where people had died in the custody of police departments after overdosing on drugs they brought into the department with them. 
“I find these cases really sad. It’s a very sad thing,” Devlin said. 
Several hypotheses exist around how the drugs are entering Connecticut’s prisons, but none have been proven. 
In 2023, after six incarcerated people died from fentanyl overdoses the previous year, Devlin said he was “determined to pursue” the causes of the deaths. But Devlin said in an interview with CT Mirror in early August that the department still didn’t get any answers. 
He said it’s difficult to get people to cooperate with law enforcement for investigations. Devlin said his office had tried to piece together connections between individuals in custody and people they knew outside of prison, but ultimately his office was unable to find the source of the drugs. 
“It’s wicked hard with substance abuse. It’s an extremely challenging thing to try and overcome it. I mean, people do. But regrettably, some people don’t. And the power of the street drugs has dramatically increased over the past, say, 10 years,” said Devlin.
And screening isn’t universal. Devlin said many people who regularly visit prison facilities — correction officers, maintenance workers, outside vendors — aren’t screened when they enter, and he suggested that the DOC employ more sophisticated testing processes.
Correctional staff suspect K2 may be entering facilities through the U.S. Mail. Demiraj said the union had spoken with the Department of Correction about either photocopying mail before it goes to incarcerated people or purchasing scanners that could pick up the presence of K2 in mail.
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department was working on purchasing mail-scanning machines that could detect any chemicals. 
Earlier this month, the state bond commission approved funding for four body scanners to be placed at York Correctional Institution in Niantic and Manson Youth Institute in Cheshire. But Demiraj told CT Mirror that the union was opposed to any requirement for officers to go through the scanners when they enter the facility, since the officers, he said, were not bringing in the majority of contraband. 
Banevicius said the installation of body scanners would “provide a noninvasive and effective way to detect hidden objects such as drugs.” He said the scanners, which the department plans to install in the lobby area of each of the prisons, would improve safety and decrease the need for strip searches. He added that staff bringing contraband into the facilities is not tolerated and said anyone who did “will be disciplined to the fullest extent possible.”

Treatment on site
While many of the overdose deaths in the last three years in the Department of Correction were the result of overdoses on street drugs, Tyler Cole’s case was different. According to the medical examiner, Cole’s death was from a combination of methadone and antipsychotic drugs he was prescribed, which was being administered while he was at Garner. 
A lawyer for Cole’s family, Ken Krayeske, recently filed a claim with the state’s Claim Commissioner asking for permission to sue the Department of Correction and requesting $25 million in damages. 
Krayeske said Cole told medical staff he’d been taking heroin, but the facility took over a month before prescribing him methadone. On July 19, he was prescribed 30 mg of methadone. The next day, he was given an additional 40 mg. Krayeske called the increase a “pretty outrageous” jump, which wouldn’t have given Cole time to build up tolerance to the drug. Cole died July 21.
Medical doctors with expertise in addiction medicine gave different responses to CT Mirror about the appropriateness of the methadone dosage Cole received. One doctor said the dosage would have been average or low if Cole was still using heroin, but high if he had, in fact, been abstinent. Another doctor said the dosage was appropriate regardless of whether he was actively using heroin. 
Krayeske said he felt it was “highly unlikely” that Cole had been using heroin while in Garner and noted that the medical examiner had not found any heroin in his body at the time of his death.
Krayeske also said that medical staff failed to evaluate Cole for symptoms of opioid withdrawal when he first entered the facility. 
If you are worried about overdoses occurring while people are incarcerated, … offering treatment … is going to be part of the solution.Dr. Ben Howell, Yale-New Haven Hospital
Cole had been arrested on several domestic violence charges, including disorderly conduct and third-degree criminal mischief, according to CT Insider.
To address the pervasiveness of addiction in its facilities, the Department of Correction administers a program known as medication assisted treatment, or MAT. The program launched in 2013, when DOC began a pilot program at the New Haven Correctional Center. 
MAT provides medication like methadone and buprenorphine, which suppresses withdrawal symptoms for people addicted to heroin or opiates. The program has expanded over the years, and as of last year some type of MAT existed in 10 of Connecticut’s 13 correctional facilities. 
Dr. Ben Howell, a doctor of internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital and one of the authors of a report making recommendations for which programs Connecticut should invest in to address the opioid crisis, said that MAT “absolutely” decreases opioid-related deaths. He also noted that the incarcerated population, as well as people who have recently left correctional custody, are at some of the highest risk for overdoses.
“ If you are worried about overdoses occurring while people are incarcerated, absolutely offering treatment, especially for opioid use disorder, is going to be part of the solution,” said Howell. 
According to DOC’s Banevicius, nurses who work for the department are required to complete an annual emergency response training that “reviews how to identify and recognize different medical emergencies including overdose, treatment and interventions for medical emergencies, and competency of emergency medication administration such as Narcan.” 
Correctional officers are trained in how to identify an opioid overdose, how to use Narcan or naloxone, the effects of xylazine, and how to identify, care for and manage someone who has been using synthetic cannabinoids — marijuana-like substances.
Each facility has a supply of the anti-overdose medication naloxone and at least one substance abuse counselor, who offers counseling to people in the facility who are struggling with substance use. 
But incarcerated people in Connecticut prisons are dying from overdoses often from controlled substances they were prescribed.

Just two days before Cole’s death, on July 19, 2024, 30-year-old Ronald Johnson also died of a methadone overdose at Garner. Johnson had been transferred to Garner from Riker’s Island prison in New York. 
Ronald Johnson’s father, Ronald Coleman, told CT Mirror that he knew his son had a substance abuse problem, although he wasn’t sure what drug he was taking. Coleman said Ronald was outgoing and charismatic. He made rap videos that he posted on YouTube, and the two of them enjoyed playing video games together. 
“He wasn’t a bad person. He just had an addiction that he couldn’t overcome,” he said. 
Coleman said his son eventually became homeless in the Bronx. When he was put in prison for probation violations, Coleman said, he felt that Ronald would be safe — off the streets and with food to eat every day. He saw it as a chance for Ronald to get better. 
Coleman said he didn’t understand why no one at the facility had noticed that his son was in medical distress.
Ronald Johnson’s mother, Jamie Johnson, said she couldn’t understand how he could have died from medications that the facility had prescribed.
According to an investigation by the Connecticut State Police, Johnson was found with an inmate request form in his right shirt pocket, on which he’d written that his feet were swelling, and he believed he was having an allergic reaction to methadone. One of the nurses at the facility wrote in the medical report that half of a white medication fell from Johnson’s bunk immediately after they began CPR. According to the state police report, which referred to a medical report by nurse, officials assumed the medication to be Vraylar, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Johnson was not being prescribed this medication, according to the report.
In response to a question about Cole and Johnson’s deaths, Banevicius said the Department of Correction does not comment on current lawsuits. 
“That being said, the medical and correctional staff members of the department are deeply affected and work hard to prevent any untimely death of an individual under our supervision,” Banevicius said. 
The Inspector General’s Office is investigating the deaths of both Johnson and Coleman.

A strained system
The high prevalence of addiction — and the department’s struggle to keep prescribed and illicit drug use under control — has placed heightened strain not only on officers and facility staff but also on the wider social safety net in surrounding communities.
Ambulance companies that serve the towns of Suffield and Somers, where Osborn and MacDougall-Walker correctional facilities are located, have told CT Mirror that the number of calls they receive for overdoses is on the rise this year. 
Data from the Somers fire department shows that it received 142 calls from Osborn Correctional Institution from January through June 2025. Of those 142, about 65 were listed as possible overdoses or “altered mental states.” A number of other calls, which listed individuals as “unresponsive,” having an “unknown medical emergency” or a seizure, could also be connected to overdoses. 
Somers First Selectman Tim Keeney said the number of ambulance calls Somers received from Osborn has increased by 40% overall compared to last year. He estimates that about 30% of the calls are overdoses.

Keeney said he hasn’t fielded any complaints from residents about delays in service; the town prioritizes serving residents, he said. But town officials did try to set up a meeting with the warden at Osborn. The meeting was cancelled, and the town has had no communication with the Department of Correction since. 
Banevicius said that when an individual is having a medical emergency, the department “has a legal and ethical responsibility to immediately seek appropriate medical attention for the affected individual, which includes contacting emergency medical services without delay.” In the same way, he said, ambulances have the responsibility to “respond promptly” to emergencies. 
John Spencer, chief of the Suffield Volunteer Ambulance Association, said they noticed an uptick in overdose calls to MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institute in Suffield in April. He also said calls to the prison have represented an increasing percentage of the calls they receive. From July 2023 to June 2024, Spencer said, about 10% of their calls were from the prison. The following year, from July 2024 to June 2025, that had increased to 15%. 
Spencer said the ambulance association had no problem responding to calls at the prisons but said that the cost of responding to these calls is often more than the amount they are paid through the state Medicaid program. 
According to data prepared for the correction officers’ union by the state, the cost of emergency medical transports to prison facilities in Connecticut was about $539,000 for the six months from January through June 2025. In comparison, the cost was about $746,000 for all of 2024.

No antidote for grief
Meanwhile, the family members are dealing with their grief. They say they want accountability for what happened to their sons. 
“It was unimaginable and it’s hard,” Ronald Johnson’s mother, Jamie, said. “I’ve been living with this every day. I think of my son every day. How? Why? What really happened?”
She described her son as a “standup person” — someone friendly who would stick up for people who were being bullied.

His father Ronald Coleman said he processed the grief mainly by throwing himself into work. He works in security and started making DoorDash deliveries. He got his commercial driver’s license, something he said he’d talked about doing with his son, so they could go trucking together. 
“No amount of money is going to bring my son back. That’s not my thing. My thing is, how many other young men is this going to happen to before somebody notices that there’s something wrong?” he asked. 
After Ciccone, Cole’s mother, found out the cause of death was methadone and prescription drugs, she started looking for an attorney. She said she couldn’t understand why Cole received methadone a month after he’d already been at the facility. 
Ciccone said her son enjoyed fishing and that he worked for a period of time with a neighbor who did landscaping. She said he also enjoyed spending time with his son, Brantley, who looks just like Cole did when he was young. 
Cole was doing well for a few years after his son was born, Ciccone said, but things would get difficult when he didn’t take his medication for bipolar disorder. Cole ended up back in Garner after violating a restraining order, which was a violation of his probation, Ciccone said. He was still waiting to go to court when he died in Garner. 
Ciccone said she can’t talk about her son’s death; if she does, she’ll burst into tears. She channels her energy into her grandson Brantley, now 9 years old.  
“It was our job to make sure he grew up with everything he ever wanted or needed,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PRISON-OVERDOSES-0830-DE-039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-14 05:56:26.495721

His leadership decisions have come under scrutiny by attorneys inside and outside of the agency. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Conflict raging within the state public defense agency has sidetracked a capital murder case while competing factions wrestle for control.
The internal fight playing out in state district court filings — set against a backdrop of personnel investigations, alleged retaliation, an effort to unionize, secret hirings, disputes about qualifications, a judge’s recusal and the firing of a decorated attorney by voicemail — chilled legal observers who say Brandon Barrett, the agency’s acting director, violated state law by meddling in the case.
“What makes it unusual is that the interim director has struck several disabling blows at his own agency,” said Eric M. Freedman, a distinguished professor at Hofstra University School of Law.
Barrett denied allegations and downplayed concerns about turmoil within the State Board of Indigent Defense Services, known as BIDS, that surfaced after former director Heather Cessna stepped down two months ago. She warned in a Kansas Reflector podcast that a constitutional crisis was inevitable because of systemic underfunding by state lawmakers.
Such a crisis is evident in the case of Kraig Kahler, who was sentenced to death for murdering his estranged wife, two daughters and grandmother-in-law in 2009 in Burlingame. With his conviction and sentence upheld on appeal, the case is at the stage where specialized attorneys examine constitutional issues, such as whether he previously received effective legal assistance.
But the case has been placed in the hands of first-year attorneys at BIDS who blamed their employer in court filings for failing to produce qualification standards for such cases or hire a qualified attorney to lead the case. They also asked the court to block Barrett from interfering with their work.
Even the Kansas Attorney General’s Office told the court that Kahler deserves better representation.
Barrett refused an interview with Kansas Reflector but responded to questions in writing. He asserted that his efforts to reassign attorneys didn’t amount to interference in the case.
“Every administration faces difficulties but I do not view this situation as embarrassing personally or as part of the agency,” Barrett wrote. “The BIDS attorneys believe they are doing the right thing. That’s laudable.”
The Kansas Supreme Court appointed retired Judge Merlin Wheeler to take over the case. Wheeler has summoned attorneys to a Monday hearing to figure out who should represent Kahler.

‘Untenable and retaliatory’
The Attorney General’s Office objected in July to allowing first-year attorneys Alisha Mehdi and Rebecca Halff to represent Kahler in his post-conviction appeals.
The two public defenders, who are part of what’s known as the Capital Habeas Office at BIDS, recognized they lacked the necessary experience to handle the case on their own. The problem, Mehdi told the court, was that BIDS had neglected its obligation to establish qualification standards for such cases and did not employ an attorney who would meet prevailing standards.
At the time, Tricia Rojo Bushnell — best-known for her work with the Midwest Innocence Project — was leading the office on a contract basis. She had the necessary experience with death penalty cases but wasn’t licensed to practice law in Kansas.
Bushnell bristled with frustration when she couldn’t get overtime approved for her overworked and understaffed office, then learned that Barrett had met in secret with a prosecutor — not a defender — in Nebraska to replace her as the office chief.
While Bushnell worked to find an outside attorney willing to work with the younger staff on the Kahler case, Barrett secretly reached a deal with Jason Belveal, of Holton, and Mark Henricksen, of Oklahoma, to take the reins instead.
Belveal’s Aug. 15 appearance in the court record blindsided the team that had been working on the Kahler case. And Henricksen falsely told the court he met with Kahler and received the client’s support. Henricksen would later blame that mistake on a paralegal.
The BIDS attorneys cried foul when they discovered Osage County District Judge Taylor Wine had held conversations with Belveal that were not part of the court record. Wine recused himself on Aug. 22.
Bushnell believed Barrett had created “an untenable and retaliatory work environment” that undermined her abilities to lead the office, as she wrote in a formal complaint on Aug. 17 to the BIDS board chair. The board chair forwarded the complaint to Barrett, who fired Bushnell in an Aug. 20 voicemail.
“The decision has been made to separate you from that employment at this time,” Barrett said in the voicemail, which Kansas Reflector obtained. “Since you don’t have benefits, there are no benefits to continue, and if you have any questions about retrieving any items or returning any information in your possession, please contact (the HR director). This is the final decision of the executive branch. Thank you.”
The feedback loop — where complaints about Barrett and the administrative office go to Barrett, who is also the agency’s chief counsel — is at the center of efforts by rank-and-file public BIDS employees to unionize.
Internal emails obtained by Kansas Reflector show the BIDS board recently authorized multiple investigations into undisclosed personnel matters at the agency.
Lindsie Ford, a senior assistant public defender, said in an interview that a union is necessary to stem widespread fears of retaliation.
“You have to go to the people you have concerns about with your concerns and just hope for the best,” she said. “It’s not creating an environment where people feel safe.”
Ford said she was afraid she would face retaliation for agreeing to be interviewed for this story.
 
Ron Wurtz, a former BIDS board chair, urged board members at their Sept. 5, 2025, meeting in Topeka to “talk to the people in the field, talk to the public defenders and see what’s going on out there.” (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
‘Devastating, chilling effect’
Ron Wurtz, a former BIDS board chair, and Rebecca Woodman — two attorneys with decades of experience in death penalty cases — separately wrote the current board to express concerns with Barrett and the Kahler case.
They believed Barrett’s actions violate a state law that prohibits BIDS administrators from interfering in cases.
“The summary dismissal of Ms. Bushnell for efforts to help her office to represent their client is chilling further zealous efforts on behalf of other clients,” Wurtz wrote. “I have spoken to a number of BIDS lawyers, including chief public defenders, who have expressed this sentiment. Several expressed the fear that, if this interference with representation continues, they will be forced to walk away from the law’s highest calling — defending life and freedom.”
Woodman wrote that Barrett’s actions created the risk of “a devastating, chilling effect on the ability to render the effective assistance of counsel, no matter how qualified.” Because the stakes are highest in a capital case, she wrote, the result “can literally mean the difference between life and death.”
Both were among nine individuals who asked to speak at the Sept. 5 meeting of the BIDS board in Topeka. They waited for hours while the board met in secret to discuss unexplained personnel matters. Then, with no public discussion, the board approved contracts for Belveal and Henricksen to take over the Kahler case.
Those who signed up to talk were granted 90 seconds apiece at the end of the board meeting. Ford wasn’t happy about the time restriction.
“I have to say, I can’t think of anything more appropriate than being given 90 seconds to address the concerns that we have outlined,” Ford told the board.
Four individuals who signed up for public comment were there to voice support for Barrett. They included Sarah McKinnon, who leads the Sedgwick County public defender office.
“I hate to see what’s going on here,” McKinnon said. “This is not what public defenders do. We don’t fight with each other. We are here supposedly for a common purpose, and that’s putting the client first. And I’m really deeply disappointed that that seems to be getting lost here.”
During the meeting, Barrett announced that Bushnell — the office chief he fired by voicemail — had left the agency to take a new job, and he wished her well. After the meeting, Barrett agreed to talk with Kansas Reflector. A few days later, he said he would only have time to respond to questions in writing.
Barrett asserted in his answers that it was appropriate to fire someone by voicemail, and that “reassigning a case is not interference.” He said he reassigned the case because Mehdi indicated in a court filing that she was not qualified to represent Kahler.
Barrett is one of three candidates who have had private interviews with the BIDS board for the director position. Ann Sagan, director of special projects at BIDS, and Clayton Perkins, the chief capital appellate defender, are the other candidates.
The board chair, Washburn University law professor Michelle Ewert, notified BIDS staff in an Aug. 29 email that the decision to hire a new director has been placed on hold “while an investigation involving confidential personnel matters is pending.”

‘Publish your damn story’
Kahler sent a handwritten note to Wheeler, the retired judge who has taken over the case, to “express my frustration” with the situation.
“I have a constitutional right to qualified and effective counsel and there have been many conversations about my representation outside of the courtroom and without informing me or informing my current representation,” Kahler wrote.
Mehdi, one of the young attorneys working the Kahler case, filed an emergency motion Aug. 29 asking the court to stop her employer from interfering. She said in her filing that Barrett had ordered the attorneys to leave the case, even though Kahler wanted them to remain.
Wheeler ordered all of the attorneys involved to attend a Zoom hearing Monday to sort out the mess.
Belveal and Henricksen, meanwhile, tried to meet with Kahler at the El Dorado Correctional Facility, but Kahler refused.
Freedman, the Hofstra University professor, helped inform the American Bar Association guidelines for capital defense work and is considered an expert in post-conviction death penalty cases. He said “we will all listen with interest” to Monday’s hearing to see what Wheeler does.
An experienced judge, Freedman said, could repair the self-inflicted damage to Kahler’s constitutional right to quality legal assistance by appointing a new attorney free from all the BIDS drama.
“It is solvable, but the judge has to be fully aware of the situation and intervene to solve it, which is one reason I wish you’d publish your damn story before that hearing,” Freedman said.
The U.S. Constitution guarantees defendants the right to effective and qualified legal counsel, and 84% of adult felony cases in Kansas require public defenders, according to the most recent BIDS annual report.
Ford said their job is to “protect the constitution, which, first of all, keeps everybody safe.” She rejected the public perception that “maybe there are some people who are less deserving of rights because we have decided that they are not good enough people.”
“It’s not about, necessarily, Kraig Kahler or your individual thoughts on him,” she said. “Every single one of the people in Kansas needs fair and just access to the criminal justice system. You need the protections that exist in the constitution.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9051347-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-14 05:56:26.495721

Kirk himself was an ardent debater, which makes his assassination even more chilling for those of us who believe our country depends upon the free and open exchange of ideas.
Some of the reaction to Kirk’s death has been outright scary, with social media calls for vengeance and retaliation (an arrest in the case was made Friday).
In this heated moment, I’d like to step back for our Sunday column space here at Kansas Reflector. Don’t worry, regular columnist Max McCoy will be back. We’re going to run a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial written back in 1922.
At the time, railroad strikes threatened commerce across the United States. Striking workers faced violence, with at least 10 slain, and officials tried desperately to restore order. In Kansas, Gov. Henry Allen urged officials to criminally charge anyone who picketed in support. Emporia Gazette editor William Allen White promptly put up a small sign in his newspaper’s front window backing the strikers. He was arrested on June, making national news. While charges against him were dropped in December, the short piece he wrote about the situation on July 27, 1922, has endured.
Throughout the editorial, White deals with the most fundamental tensions in our democratic society: the freedom of speech, the fear of disorder and the worry that misguided ideas will triumph. The situation he faced differs from today, but his words struck me as worth a read.

To an anxious friend
You tell me that law is above freedom of utterance. And I reply that you can have no wise laws nor free entertainment of wise laws unless there is free expression of the wisdom of the people — and, alas, their folly with it. But if there is freedom, folly will die of its own poison, and the wisdom will survive. That is the history of the race. It is proof of man’s kinship with God. You say that freedom of utterance is not for time of stress, and I reply with the sad truth that only in time of stress is freedom of utterance in danger. No one questions it in calm days, because it is not needed. And the reverse is true also; only when free utterance is suppressed is it needed, and when it is needed, it is most vital to justice.
Peace is good. But if you are interested in peace through force and without free discussion — that is to say, free utterance decently and in order — your interest in justice is slight. And peace without justice is tyranny, no matter how you may sugarcoat it with expedience. This state today is in more danger from suppression than from violence, because, in the end, suppression leads to violence. Violence, indeed, is the child of suppression. Whoever pleads for justice helps to keep the peace; and whoever tramples on the plea for justice temperately made in the name of peace only outrages peace and kills something fine in the heart of man which God put there when we got our manhood. When that is killed, brute meets brute on each side of the line.
So, dear friend, put fear out of your heart. This nation will survive, this state will prosper, the orderly business of life will go forward if only men can speak in whatever way given them to utter what their hearts hold — by voice, by posted card, by letter, or by press. Reason has never failed men. Only force and repression have made the wrecks in the world.

Read More,"By Ryan Colasanti   NEWARK — The Fightin’ Blue Hens offense started at their own 22 yard line with just over two minutes to play and one timeout remaining. UConn led UD by three in the twilight of the back-and-forth game. Junior quarterback Nick Manicucci and the Blue Hen offense traversed the field to the Huskies 26 yard line setting the stage for graduate kicker Nate Reed.
Earlier in the quarter, Reed missed a 47 yard attempt that would’ve tied the score. This kick was four yards closer, but with even more pressure attached. With two seconds remaining, the ball was snapped, the holder placed it and Reed sneaked it barely above the crossbar. Reed completed his chance at redemption.
Reed’s kick sent the game to overtime where Manicucci capitalized on the opportunity scoring the game winning touchdown in the Blue Hens 44-41 win over the UConn Huskies, Saturday evening.
“Everything that we believe in, we went back to those fundamentals and the foundational aspects of our program and we played harder than that team today and we finished today. And that’s just so special to be a part of,” head coach Ryan Carty said postgame.
UD’s fight was on display all game. The Blue Hens answered almost every scoring drive the Huskies mustered with one of their own. There were only two drives in which the Blue Hens failed to answer a UConn score, one of them Reed’s missed field goal.
The first career FBS game between the Huskies and Blue Hens was an offensive shootout.
The two teams combined for 52 points through the first half and over 600 yards of offense. The two offenses finished with over a thousand yards of offense combined in the programs’ first meeting since 1998.
Both offenses featured a balanced offensive repertoire amassing over 150 yards on the ground and through the air. The Blue Hens had the advantage in the running game with a game high 247 rushing yards. 179 of those yards came from senior running back Jo Silver.
Silver ran for a career high 70 yard touchdown in the first quarter after UConn tied the game with its own long touchdown run courtesy of redshirt junior Cam Edwards.
“As I was trying to reverse, they kind of like almost got a hand on me, but I was able to beat it obviously,” said Silver about his touchdown run. “And then when I was down the field, I turned around at the perfect time and saw him diving and I got my feet up.”
That run was just one of a couple career firsts for the New Jersey product. Silver finished the game with a career high in rushing yards and his first career game with multiple rushing touchdowns.
Silver’s teammate, Kyre Duplessis, put together a similar career defining outing.
In the absence of leading receiver Jake Thaw, Duplessis caught nine of his 11 targets for a career high 161 yards and a touchdown. Duplessis’ second touchdown of the season came on a 68 yard pass and catch down the left sideline. The Coastal Carolina transfer leaped above his defender on third down to come away with the contested catch and scurried down the left sideline into the endzone for the longest touchdown reception of his career. The play gave UD a 28-24 halftime lead.
“I knew I was very close to the sideline. I knew once I caught the ball I wanted to try and stay in and I did my best. I didn’t hear a whistle so I said ‘alright sweet’,” Duplessis said.
Despite the career day, UConn paced the passing game with 346 yards through the air. The Huskies threw 39 times completing 28 of them to 10 different pass catchers.
The defenses weren’t much of a factor in the contest, but when they needed to make a play the Blue Hen defense came up with their first sack of the game holding UConn to a field goal on the first possession of overtime. The stop meant a UD touchdown would win the game and the Blue Hens ran a quarterback run option play that worked all game long — Manicucci scored all three of his rushing touchdowns on the play — to win the game.
The Blue Hens will try and carry the momentum from their first home overtime win since 2017 into their first Conference USA game against Florida International University next Saturday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4186v2-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-13 23:56:23.810120

California leaders wrapped this year’s legislative session Saturday afternoon, prolonged by last-minute backroom deals on climate and energy, sparking deep frustration among some lawmakers.


Three days before the scheduled end of the legislative session this week, Sen. Lena Gonzalez introduced legislation to limit Los Angeles’ controversial recent “mansion tax” on high-value real estate deals. She backed down just a day later. 
“We wanted more time,” she said. “We wanted to do more due diligence … There were so many other issues on the docket.”
The California Legislature slogged through a marathon final week this week, extending its session into Saturday to push through a major package of climate and energy policies. The Saturday vote was needed because Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire didn’t finalize their privately negotiated deal on how to extend the state’s cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions program until early Wednesday, past the normal legislative deadline for introducing bills. 
Lobbied heavily by interest groups across the state, the package took up significant energy in the final days of the session. 
Leaders also rushed through several Newsom administration budget measures that shield construction for the Los Angeles Olympics from environmental review, prop up struggling child care centers, bolster the state’s ability to recommend immunizations and allocate $70 million in new state general fund spending. 
The result? Other measures ran out of time. And, many Democrats were left grumbling about how business gets done on consequential measures — but they still overwhelmingly approved them. 
Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat who has served in the Legislature for a combined 11 years, said the week seemed to contain “the most number of issues that are big issues that have been addressed in the last days of session.”
“To the extent any of them had already been through the policy committees, that’s great,” he said. “To the extent they’re seeing sunshine for the first time, then not so great.”
Assembly Budget Chair Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat, attributed the time crunch partly to Democrats’ whirlwind weeklong efforts last month to place a congressional redistricting plan on the November ballot. 
Gabriel said he shares the frustration with the lengthy session. “It’s a very clear negotiating strategy to drag things out to try to create leverage at the last minute,” he said.
Speaking to reporters afterward, Rivas said the January wildfires, President Donald Trump’s policies and the state’s structural budget deficit also added to the Legislature’s work this year. But he deemed it“the most productive year over the past decade,” celebrating the energy and climate deals as well as a historic rollback of the state’s environmental law to clear the way for development. 
“With unity, with urgency and focus, this Assembly delivered,” he said in a floor speech. 
Disputed antisemitism measure goes to governor
Lawmakers did approve a series of high-profile measures to fight federal immigration crackdowns, boost transit-oriented housing, rein in the tech industry and expand labor’s reach. 
This week, the Legislature OK’d a pair of proposals to ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement from wearing masks on duty, a reaction to sweeping immigration raids by unidentified agents. They passed a labor-championed measure to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize, tying it to an industry-friendly measure to lower companies’ insurance costs. They also gave the final greenlight to Senate Bill 79, a controversial measure allowing developers to build denser housing near transit regardless of local zoning regulations. 
In the wee hours of Saturday morning, lawmakers agreed to appropriate $10 million per year toward funding local news. Google has agreed to commit $10 million toward the effort as well.
Also heading to Newsom’s desk is a controversial measure that aims to prevent antisemitism in schools. The bill, supported by the legislative Jewish Caucus, was passed following emotional hearings and animated debates. Following the bill’s passage, a few pro-Palestinian protesters began shouting from the Assembly gallery, yelling, “You will all have blood on your hands” as lawmakers continued their business.
While supporters argue the legislation is necessary to protect Jewish students from discrimination, opponents, including major education associations and the American Civil Liberties Union’s political action arm, argued for months that the proposal risked “weaponizing” public education and censoring Palestinian-related instruction in K-12 schools.

Another bill awaiting Newsom’s signature would require human oversight when an employer primarily uses artificial intelligence for disciplinary purposes.
But lawmakers punted multiple tech measures to next year, including a proposal to require tests of automated decision systems before they can be used in important personnel decisions. This is at least the second time such efforts have stalled, amid strong opposition from business associations and health care providers. 
They also shelved a measure that would have restricted workplace surveillance by public and private employers, a victory for the California Chamber of Commerce. 
A controversial criminal justice bill that drew strong opposition from moderate Democrats failed to advance. The measure would have made low-level felony offenders eligible for diversion programs, allowing them to avoid jail time. 
Some Democrats including Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove, Maggy Krell of Sacramento and Anamarie Avila Farias of Concord joined Republicans in opposing the bill. 
Property tax limit, environmental rules fall short
The pileup of priorities caused some issues to fall by the wayside.
Gonzalez’s bill would cap the Los Angeles voter-approved tax on high-value real estate deals, currently 4 to 5.5% of the property’s value, over concerns it’s dampening construction.
The measure sparked opposition from tenants’ advocates, who campaigned for the tax to raise affordable housing funds, and from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which opposes the tax. The bill is written to kneecap an anti-tax ballot initiative the association filed for next fall’s election.
The Long Beach Democrat said she’ll pick up the issue next year, and said she couldn’t meet with all sides this year in part because of the volume of priorities this session. 
Another issue that remains unresolved: How to restore environmental review requirements for the construction of certain manufacturing plants — a priority for environmental justice advocates. Newsom earlier this year strong-armed lawmakers into loosening those reviews, but McGuire and other Democratic leaders promised in June to revisit it this fall. 
But top Democrats failed to agree, angering colleagues. In a mad dash to show their efforts, lawmakers rolled out three last-minute proposals, but the only one to pass does little to address environmental concerns.

Rivas called the lack of progress “unfortunate,” and promised to convene a working group next year. 
“Certainly it is unacceptable that that work was not completed by the end of session,” he told reporters.
Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs the budget committee, attributed the lack of a deal to a disagreement with the Assembly, and said redistricting took up negotiating time
“We had a lot on our plate, and it delayed resolution of some issues,” he said. “That being said, it’s all happening … I don’t want to be here on a Saturday, but so be it.”
Frustration permeates California Senate
As the session dragged to its conclusion, some lawmakers were ready for new leadership.
Frustrations spilled over Wednesday night in the Senate Budget Committee, when several lawmakers of both parties criticized Newsom’s administration and legislative leaders for asking them to approve millions of dollars of state spending with little notice. The bills had been unveiled the day before, with no time left to amend them. 
Several Democrats took issue with how leaders steered some funds to local projects without their input.
Sen. Chris Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat, singled out projects in the North Coast that would get funding and said he found “no basis” for why Californians and lawmakers statewide weren’t consulted.
“There are more than just a handful of disadvantaged communities, plus the North Coast, in California,” he said.
McGuire happens to represent that region. Altogether, his district would get upwards of $85  million through the bill for environmental, housing, transportation and fire protection projects. That includes about $50 million from the climate bond for the Great Redwood Trail, a plan McGuire has championed to convert 231 miles of old railway into a trail in Mendocino, Trinity and Humboldt counties. 
Cabaldon slammed the “concentration of decision-making power that has emerged through this process this year.” In an interview, he said he wasn’t blaming anyone specifically, but“everyone is frustrated” by how the week played out.
Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, was more frank.
“The buck stops with the people in charge,” Menjivar said. “How everything transpired this week left a sour taste in people’s mouths. I don’t think a majority of us would want us to repeat this next year.”
After being told in the spring that lawmakers needed to cut funding for undocumented immigrants’ health coverage, she was angered not to have gotten the chance to weigh in on new spending, and complained to Senate leadership.
Following all the griping, McGuire announced this week that the Senate was moving up the date that incoming Senate leader Sen. Monique Limón of Santa Barbara would take over, to Nov. 17 instead of in January.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Iowa congressional candidates took time Saturday at the Polk County Democrats’ Steak Fry to condemn political violence in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing in Utah.
The Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, an annual fundraiser, featured speeches from Democratic candidates for Iowa’s U.S. Senate race, as well as from the 3rd and 4th congressional district races. Van Hollen, who gave a keynote address at the event, spoke about Kirk’s death, saying the shooting is a reminder of “how fragile our democracy can feel,” while criticizing Trump’s response to the issue.
On Wednesday, Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot while answering a question at an event at Utah Valley University. The suspected gunman was identified and taken into custody Friday. Politicians and leaders mourned Kirk’s death and called for a change to prevent future politically motivated violence.

“The answer cannot be more violence,” Van Hollen said. “The answer cannot be vengeance. And sadly, the president is using this moment not to unite America against political violence, but to engage in finger pointing. But we will not be silenced. We will speak out for what we believe vigorously, courageously and peacefully.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said it has been a “really hard week” in light of Kirk’s death, and that Democrats, and all Americans, need to take steps to ensure these threats are eliminated.
“We don’t have to look very far to see other examples of violence that has occurred because of political leanings,” Hart said, in part referring to the fatal shooting of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June. “And none of us find that to be acceptable, because it simply isn’t. We live in a country that was founded on the principle that we could stand up in a place like this and express our feelings, our thoughts, our attitudes, our beliefs and our political leanings, and not get shot because we have an opinion or a thought that’s different than somebody else’s.”
In Iowa, there has been an outpouring of sympathy for Kirk’s family and calls to stop political violence. Speaking with reporters, Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate called for an end to political violence.
In recent days, there has been some criticism from Republicans and others of Iowans, including some teachers, who have made controversial social media posts about Kirk’s death.
Democratic Senate candidate Jackie Norris, the school board president for the Des Moines Public Schools, said political violence was unacceptable, and that teachers — alongside most people — should be more cognizant of what their are publicly posting on social media. However, Norris added, “we have to respect that people have different views,” including teachers.
“It is important that we tone down the rhetoric, but we also have to respect that (teachers) have strong feelings too,” Norris said. “It’s a balance.”
Van Hollen calls Democrats ‘spineless’ for not backing Mamdani
Van Hollen also told Iowans at the event winning in 2026 elections will mean Democrats must be outspokenly in support of Democratic candidates running in 2025 races — including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.
The Maryland Democrat said Iowa would play an important role in the 2026 midterms — but that supporting Democrats in 2025 races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as for New York City mayor, will help build “momentum” for 2026.
Van Hollen criticized New York Democrats for not supporting Mamdani, who is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. He said many Democrats representing New York in the U.S. House and Senate have “stayed on the sidelines” as President Donald Trump and others have mobilized to defeat the Democratic candidate.
“That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of,” Van Hollen said. “They need to get behind him and get behind him now.”
Van Hollen criticized other aspects of the Democratic Party, saying the Biden administration was “feckless” in holding the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accountable to U.S. and international law. But he largely focused his remarks on Trump and Republicans in control of Congress.
In addition to talking about Medicaid cuts and criticizing Trump’s foreign policy decisions, Van Hollen said the Trump administration was violating people’s constitutional rights by pursuing mass deportations. The Maryland Democrat gained a significant national platform earlier in 2025 for his work involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador erroneously and held in the country’s megaprison.
Van Hollen was one of the major advocates for returning Abrego Garcia to the country and allowing his case to go through the U.S. court system. At the Saturday event, Van Hollen told Iowans he was advised not to pursue the issue as immigration was not a winning topic for Democrats — but he said he continued to fight for Abrego Garcia’s due process rights because “our democracy cannot survive on silence or equivocation.”
“And lo and behold, Americans across the political spectrum do believe in the red, white and blue essential right to due process in the United States of America,” he said. “They do believe in the principle that no one in America — I mean, no one — should be disappeared by the state without having a chance before a court of law. And Americans understand this is not about one man. It’s about all of us. Because when you strip away the rights from one person, you threaten the rights of all, of all of us.”
Abrego Garcia has been returned to the U.S., though the Trump administration has stated they intend to deport him again, potentially to the country of Eswatini.
Van Hollen said he would “never, ever apologize for standing up for anybody’s constitutional rights,” and said Democrats need to do more to speak out on issues they believe are important, even if polls or pundits say the topics are not politically advantageous. This will be especially important in states like Iowa, he said.
“We can and we will win here again, if — if — we speak to our core values, if we show people what we will stand up for and we will fight for,” Van Hollen said. “That’s why it’s great to be here to flip steaks and flip seats.”

(File photo provided by Clemson University)Clemson University suspended an employee Saturday following social media posts that mocked the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as the Legislature’s GOP leaders called for an emergency meeting of the school’s governing board.
The suspension came two days after Clemson College Republicans began flagging social media posts of employees’ reactions to Kirk’s death Wednesday. Of the three people the college chapter called out — including two assistant professors — it is unclear who is suspended.
The public Upstate university declined to provide any further information on the “personnel matter.”
The suspension announcement followed outcry online from state politicians, Clemson students and alumni and Republican members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation.
“This action reflects the seriousness with which Clemson approaches violations of its standards and values,” reads the statement posted about noon Saturday. “We understand the frustration, and we share the deep concern over the nature of these posts.”
Also on Saturday, GOP leaders of both Statehouse chambers called on Clemson’s Board of Trustees to meet and “take immediate and appropriate action.” The three-paragraph letter did not specify what they wanted the board to do.
“We were shocked and saddened this week by the murder of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. It leaves a dark stain on our nation’s history,” reads the letter signed by the Senate president, House speaker and chief budget writers of each chamber.
“In its aftermath, several Clemson University faculty made vile and troubling comments,” it continued. “While the University has issued a statement, it fails to address the gravity of the matter.”
The letter, dated Saturday, was posted on social media shortly after Clemson’s announcement.
House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, one of the four signers, said the leaders wanted to make clear that the college’s first statement was not enough.
That four-paragraph statement, posted Friday afternoon, said “Clemson University unequivocally condemns any and all expressions that endorse, glorify or celebrate political violence. … This is an opportunity for each of us to stop and consider our core values of mutual respect, integrity and personal responsibility.”
Bannister told the SC Daily Gazette the trustees need to meet and take “fairly significant action” but did not say whether that should mean firing the employees.
“I think they need to talk to the professors, look at what was posted,” said the Greenville Republican. “The professors should be given an opportunity to explain their position, and then they should make a decision based on what’s the right path forward for Clemson.”
Also signing the letter were Senate President Thomas Alexander and Senate Finance Chairman Harvey — both Clemson graduates — and House Speaker Murrell Smith. They did not immediately return messages from the Gazette.
It’s unclear whether firing is an option.
The university’s latest statement said an investigation into the posts continues and the school would “act within the bounds of the law” and university policies.
A state law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.” But South Carolina is also an at-will employment state, meaning employers generally can fire an employee for any or no reason.
Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to combat progressive politics on college campuses, was shot in the neck about 12:20 p.m. Wednesday as he debated with students at Utah Valley University. About 3,000 people gathered outside for one of Kirk’s signature “prove me wrong” events.
He was answering a question about mass shootings when he was hit by a single bullet. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital. On Friday morning, officials announced the arrest of a 22-year-old Utah man, who was not a student of that college.
“In my opinion any post that indicates this was acceptable behavior is out of line,” Bannister said.
The social media posts flagged by the college GOP chapter came from two assistant professors and an employee who appears to work in operations. None of the employees responded to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.

California lawmakers passed a six-bill climate and energy package extending cap and trade to 2045, expanding the state’s wildfire fund, approving new oil drilling, and opening the door to a regional power market.


Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.
The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.
Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.
The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature. 
Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.
Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.
Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.
“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”
The future of cap and trade reinforced
At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.
The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.
The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”
The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”
“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.
Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.
Questioning the affordability premise
The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.
At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.
“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”
Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.
“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”
Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”
Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.
A ‘giveaway to big oil’?
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there. 
The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”
Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”
“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.
Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.
Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.
Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern. 
The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.

Ron DeSantis has been aggressive in vetoing appropriations in the state budget for LGBTQ programs.
Cognizant of that fact, some Democratic legislators, say, they’ve been able to continue support for those programs by omitting any direct references to the LGBTQ community in their appropriation proposals.
But that gambit may be coming to an end, one lawmaker suggested on Saturday.
“I think you need to be prepared for what is coming,” warned state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-Orlando) on Saturday, speaking during the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus summer meeting in Tampa. “Yes, we should continue to urge our senators and our representatives in the Legislature to fund these programs. We should not stop. “
But Smith fears the state’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives led by Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia are taking aim at local governments for funding anything associated with DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). And he’s concerned that could lead to legislation barring municipalities or counties from funding such efforts in the future.
Last month, 16 Orange County employees were served with investigative subpoenas regarding the county’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; climate initiatives; procurement; and contracts or grants. They were issued after Ingoglia said it was “probable” that Orange County employees tried to hide information when his DOGE team began examining spending practices within the county government.
Among the agencies caught up in the search are the Zebra Coalition Inc. and Zebra Youth Inc., plus the Orlando Youth Alliance Inc., according to the Orlando Sentinel. The paper reported that while those groups support LGBTQ communities, the county argued the programs were open to all.
“While we will fight the proposal if it comes, I believe a proposal may come that will basically now finally prohibit our local governments from being able to fund these organizations through grants, because they’re gonna say putting a roof over a young person’s head who is queer or is LGBTQ is diversity and inclusion and now prohibited under Florida law,” Smith said.
No such legislation has been introduced to date, Smith acknowledge, but “if rainbow crosswalks attached to the interim memorial of Pulse nightclub are fair game for this depraved administration, they will come for other things, too, and we have to be prepared to fight back against it,” he said.

Joining Smith in an hourlong discussion at the Westshore Grand Hotel in South Tampa were three other Democratic LGBTQ members of the Legislature: Sen. Shevrin Jones (D-Miami Gardens), Rep. Michele Rayner (D-St. Petersburg), and Rep. Mitch Rosenwald (D-Oakland Park).
The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was never explicitly mentioned during the discussion, although his death was indirectly referenced when the lawmakers were asked to opine about a news report referencing the transgender community published last week.
CNN reported that in the aftermath of the Minneapolis Catholic Church shooting that took place late last month, senior U.S. Justice Department officials are reportedly weighing proposals to limit transgender people’s right to possess firearms.
Smith called it “a bigoted and transphobic attack,” and then asked the audience to think about how conservatives had responded to mass shootings in the immediate past.
“If it is a Hispanic person that has committed a violent crime, they want to build a wall,” he said. “If it is a Black or African-American person who has committed a violent crime, it is that we need to target Black Lives Matter and we need to erase honest history. If it is a trans or an LGBTQ person who commits a violent crime, we have proposals like this.
“But if it’s a white male American, the response in the last 24 hours has now been, ‘We need to understand what we’re doing to young men and stop giving them access to video games and understand what they’re going through,'” he said. “I think we should have empathy for all people regardless of what their background is. And we have to call out bigoted, discriminatory policies for what they are.”
Rayner called the report “a distraction” and a way to paralyze members of the LGBTQ community to not commit to any positive actions.
“These are very unserious people,” she said. “These are people who are not rigorous in their actual thinking capacity. They’re just not, and so ultimately we have to see it for what it is.”
If Republicans were serious about addressing mental health, “they would just fund mental health. Period,” Jones said to cheers. “The only reason why Republicans continue to beat up on our transgender community is because they believe that’s their easy target.”
He added that it is incumbent upon LGBTQ lawmakers to fight as hard for their constituents as they ever have.
“Too often, the LGBTQIA+ community, we feel that sometimes we have to kowtow to individuals who wouldn’t spit on us if we were on fire. And so, because of that, I want to make clear that those of us who run for office … don’t allow this moment to allow us to be scared to speak up. Because there are young people and there are people dependent on our mouth, and if we have a seat at the table, dammit, we better use every ounce of our being to pushback on the BS that the Republicans are doing.”

“I see people from all walks of life here today, and that’s truly, truly beautiful,” said Julian Camera, an organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado. “We’re going to overcome this. We’re going to keep fighting.”
The dormant Hudson Correctional Facility is owned by a real estate investment trust and was formerly leased to private-prison company The GEO Group, which operated the prison for a span of just five years after its 2009 opening, during which the facility housed inmates from Alaska. The prison has a capacity of about 1,200 beds — only slightly less than the population of the town of Hudson, about 30 miles northeast of Denver on Interstate 76.

The facility is one of six potential new ICE detention centers in Colorado revealed by the ACLU as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit earlier this year. Internal documents obtained by The Washington Post last month again indicated that the facility, along with another dormant prison in Walsenburg, is under consideration by the agency, but no formal announcement has yet been made. Representatives for ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
Colorado is currently home to only one ICE detention center, an Aurora facility also operated by The GEO Group. The potential expansions, which could triple the state’s immigrant detention capacity, are part of the Trump administration’s plans for a sweeping mass deportation program, bolstered by $45 billion in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved in July.
“That money doesn’t just come from Hudson or Walsenburg — that’s everyone’s money,” Camera told the crowd. “That comes from Hudson, that comes from Denver, that comes from the state of Colorado, and the people of Hudson should be concerned. Why? Because now their city becomes dependent on tearing families apart.”










I see people from all walks of life here today, and that’s truly, truly beautiful ... We’re going to overcome this. We’re going to keep fighting.


– Julian Camera, organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado


In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Protesters at Saturday’s demonstration carried signs that likened ICE detention centers to concentration camps. Speakers especially objected to the opening of a new facility in a remote rural area, where detainees’ families and legal aid groups would find it more difficult to visit.

Hudson Mayor Joe Hammock told Denver7 last month that he would support the facility reopening “like any business that wants to open up in Hudson.” While operational, the facility supported about 200 jobs.
But Gina McAfee, statewide coordinator of Colorado Immigrant Protection Teams, pointed to studies showing that prisons don’t provide the economic benefits that local boosters often promise.
“The bottom line — I would ask, did Hudson’s economy improve when this facility was operational? We think not,” she told the crowd at Saturday’s protest.
“We urge you to push back on any local or state entity who needs to approve of the plan to reopen this facility,” McAfee added. “Let’s all just say no.”

,California,2025-09-13 18:15:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why California backed off again from ambitious AI regulation,Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/09/ai-regulation-on-hold-again/,A bill mandating disclosure and appeals for a wide range of AI decisions was delayed until next year for the third legislative session in a row. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to consult on the measure.,"In summary
A bill mandating disclosure and appeals for a wide range of AI decisions was delayed until next year for the third legislative session in a row. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to consult on the measure.




After three years of trying to give Californians the right to know when AI is making a consequential decision about their lives and to appeal when things go wrong, Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said she and her supporters will have to wait again, until next year.
The San Ramon Democrat announced Friday that Assembly Bill 1018, which cleared the Assembly and two Senate committees, has been designated a two-year bill, meaning it can return as part of the legislative session next year. That move will allow more time for conversations with Gov. Gavin Newsom and more than 70 opponents. The decision came in the final hours of the California Legislative session, which ends today. 
Her bill would require businesses and government agencies to alert individuals when automated  systems are used to make important decisions about them, including for apartment leases, school admissions, and, in the workplace, hiring, firing, promotions, and disciplinary actions. The bill also covers decisions made in education, health care, criminal justice, government benefits, financial services, and insurance.
Automated systems that assign people scores or make recommendations can stop Californians from receiving unemployment benefits they’re entitled to, declare job applicants less qualified for arbitrary reasons that have nothing to do with job performance, or deny people health care or a mortgage because of their race.
“This pause reflects our commitment to getting this critical legislation right, not a retreat from our responsibility to protect Californians,” Bauer-Kahan said in a statement shared with CalMatters.
Bauer-Kahan adopted the principles enshrined in the legislation from the Biden administration’s AI Bill of Rights. California has passed more AI regulation than any other state, but has yet to adopt a law like Bauer-Kahan’s or like other laws requiring disclosure of consequential AI decisions like the Colorado AI Act or European Union’s AI Act. 
The pause comes at a time when politicians in Washington D.C. continue to oppose AI regulation that they say could stand in the way of progress. Last week, leaders of the nation’s largest tech companies joined President Trump at a White House dinner to further discuss a recent executive order and other initiatives to  prevent AI regulation. Earlier this year, Congress tried and failed to pass a moratorium on AI regulation by state governments.
When an automated system makes an error, AB 1018 gives people the right to have that mistake rectified within 60 days. It also reiterates that algorithms must give “full and equal” accommodations to everyone, and cannot discriminate against people based on characteristics like age, race, gender, disability, or immigration status. Developers must carry out impact assessments to, among other things, test for bias embedded in their systems. If an impact assessment is not conducted on an AI system, and that system is used to make consequential decisions about people’s lives, the developer faces fines of up to $25,000 per violation, or legal action by the attorney general, public prosecutors, or the Civil Rights Department.
Amendments made to the bill in recent weeks exempted generative AI models from coverage under the bill, which could prevent it from impacting major AI companies or ongoing generative AI pilot projects carried out by state agencies. The bill was also amended to delay a developer auditing requirement to 2030, and to clarify that the bill intends to address evaluating a person and making predictions or recommendations about them.
An intense legislative fight
Samantha Gordon, a chief program officer at TechEquity, a sponsor of the bill, said she’s seen more lobbyists attempt to kill AB 1018 this week in the California Senate than for any other AI bill ever. She said she thinks AB 1018 had a pathway to passage but the decision was made to pause in order to work with the governor, who ends his second and final term next year.
“There’s a fundamental disagreement about whether or not these tools should face basic scrutiny of testing and informing the public that they’re being used,” Gordon said.
Gordon thinks it’s possible tech companies will use their “unlimited amount of money” to fight the bill next year.. 
“But it’s clear,” she added, “that Americans want these protections — poll after poll shows Americans want strong laws on AI and that voluntary protections are insufficient.”
AB 1018 faced opposition from industry groups, big tech companies, the state’s largest health care provider, venture capital firms, and the Judicial Council of California, a policymaking body for state courts.
A coalition of hospitals, Kaiser Permanente, and health care software and AI company Epic Systems urged lawmakers to vote no on 1018 because they argued the bill would negatively influence patient care, increase costs, and require developers to contract with third-party auditors to assess compliance by 2030.
A coalition of business groups opposed the bill because of generalizing language and concern that compliance could be expensive for businesses and taxpayers. The group Technet, which seeks to shape policy nationwide and whose members include companies like Apple, Google, Nvidia, and OpenIAI, argued that AB 1018 would stifle job growth, raise costs, and punish the fastest growing industries in the state in a video ad campaign.
Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose founder Marc Andreessen supported the re-election of President Trump, oppose the bill due to costs and due to the fact that the bill seeks to regulate AI in California and beyond.
A policy leader in the state judiciary said in an alert sent to lawmakers urging a no vote this week that the burden of compliance with the bill is so great that the judicial branch is at risk of losing the ability to use pretrial risk assessment tools like the kind that assign recidivism scores to sex offenders and violent felons. The state Judicial Council, which makes policy for California courts, estimates that AB 1018 passage will cost the state up to $300 million a year. Similar points were made in a letter to lawmakers last month.
Why backers keep fighting
Exactly how much AB 1018 could cost taxpayers is still a big unknown, due to contradictory information from state government agencies. An analysis by California legislative staff found that if the bill passes it could cost local agencies, state agencies, and the state judicial branch hundreds of millions of dollars. But a California Department of Technology report covered exclusively by CalMatters concluded in May that no state agencies use high risk automated systems, despite historical evidence to the contrary. Bauer-Kahan said last month that she was surprised by the financial impact estimates because CalMatters reporting found that automated decisionmaking system use was not widespread at the state level.
Support for the bill has come from unions who pledged to discuss AI in bargaining agreements, including the California Nurses Association and the Service Employees International Union, and from groups like the Citizen’s Privacy Coalition, Consumer Reports, and the Consumer Federation of California.
Coauthors of AB 1018 include major Democratic proponents of AI regulation in the California Legislature, including Assembly majority leader Cecilia Aguilar-Curry of Davis, author of a bill passed and on the governor’s desk that seeks to stop algorithms from raising prices on consumer goods; Chula Vista Senator Steve Padilla, whose bill to protect kids from companion chatbots awaits the governor’s decision; and San Diego Assemblymember Chris Ward, who previously helped pass a law requiring state agencies to disclose use of high-risk automated systems and this year sought to pass a bill to prevent pricing based on your personal information.
The anti-discrimination language in AB 1018 is important because tech companies and their customers often see themselves as exempt from discrimination law if the discrimination is done by automated systems, said Inioluwa Deborah Raji, an AI researcher at UC Berkeley who has audited algorithms for discrimination and advised government officials in Sacramento and Washington D.C. about how AI can harm people. She questions whether state agencies have the resources to enforce AB 1018, but also likes the disclosure requirement in the bill because “I think people deserve to know, and there’s no way that they can appeal or contest without it.”
“I need to know that an AI system was the reason I wasn’t able to rent this house. Then I can at an individual level appeal and contest. There’s something very valuable about that.”
Raji said she witnessed corporate influence and pushback when she helped shape a report about how California can balance guardrails and innovation for generative AI development, and she sees similar forces at play in the delay of AB 1018.
“It’s disappointing this [AB 1018] isn’t the priority for AI policy folks at this time,” she told CalMatters. “I truly hope the fourth time is the charm.”
A number of other bills with union backing were also considered by lawmakers this session that sought to protect workers from artificial intelligence. For the third year in a row, a bill to require a human driver in commercial delivery trucks in autonomous vehicles failed to become law. Assembly Bill 1331, which sought to prevent surveillance of workers with AI-powered tools in private spaces like locker or lactation rooms and placed limitations on surveillance in breakrooms, also failed to pass.
But another measure, Senate Bill 7 passed the legislature and is headed to the governor. It requires employers to disclose plans to use an automated system 30 days prior to  doing so  and make annual requests data used by an employer for discipline or firing. In recent days, author Senator Jerry McNerney amended the law to remove the right to appeal decisions made by AI and eliminate a prohibition against employers making predictions about a worker’s political beliefs, emotional state, or neural data. The California Labor Federation supported similar bills in Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, and Washington.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/042324_Sacramento-Works-Job-Center_MG_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-13 14:57:07.569892

A strong breeze cools the shade under large oak trees, and makes lounging and visiting with friends a more pleasant time as the heat of the day rises.
Wade makes the rounds, chatting with friends old and new. He stops kids riding horses to ask how they’re doing. He asks about the horses. He smiles and waves, laughing and telling stories before heading towards the fencing of the oval track where drivers train and race harness horses called Standardbreds.

Along the way, Wade spots a mechanical bull, promptly pulls off his boots and hops on. He rides with glee and to the amusement of the small crowd gathered to cheer him on. The crowd records his joy on cell phones held high. Eventually, he’s thrown off, but is all smiles. He accepts a few hugs as his reward, puts on his boots, then encourages the children to try their hand at bull riding.

“I love this,” he said, waving an arm to indicate the festivities around him. “I especially love seeing these kids out here riding. There’s a lot of our youth that come to shows like this and the horse races that are interested in horses, but they don’t even have a horse. Their parents and not any of their family members have horses.”

Wade wants to help kids in his community – especially those of color – learn equestrian skills as another way for them to get into college. He has made it his mission.

“Here I am, a cowboy, rancher, horse trainer, horse racer and a licensed official for the United States Trotting Association. I’m an equestrian consultant, calf roper, steer wrestler and do workshops to train our youth. If I could put all that on a business card, know what would be in the boldest print? 
“I’m a mentor,” Wade said.

“So I thought, you know what. I’m going to try and do everything I can to change that,” Wade said, before waving down two young men galloping across the green sward to chat them up. He asks if they’re enjoying themselves, about the horses they ride.

“What I do is try and pair these kids with someone that has horses. They get an opportunity to learn how to train, ride and care for them. If they’re really serious about what they’re doing, I make it possible for them to get their driver or jockey license, compete on a professional level. And for the ones not interested in that, we find activities for them too.” 
Wade walks back to the fence at the oval track, hitching up a booted foot to resume sharing his mission.

“Kids can also get involved in sports clubs like 4-H, learn a respectable trade like being a farrier, earning them a good living. It’s really about equestrian and agricultural activities, because it can get them a college scholarship. My own son is going to college on a rodeo scholarship, getting a full ride, if you know what I mean,” he said, smiling broadly.

Wade mentions a program for youth he’s starting with Rep. Rickey Thompson, a Democrat from Shannon. He hopes to help them “get started on the right path.”
“My path was out of love and necessity. Necessity as in making a living. I want to be a model of success to these kids so that they not just dream of success, but to have success,” he said. “I want to be for them what Lane Frost was for me. He was my bull riding idol. I loved that guy. He was awesome. Not only was he a great cowboy, he was a great person. He always took the time to stop and talk with kids. That made a big impression on me. I never forgot it.”

(Photo by Caroline Donovan/Integration and Application Network,UMCES)The reviews are in, and they’re not good: Commenters had stern words in the just-closed public comment period for the newly revised Chesapeake Bay agreement, a voluntary clean-up pact between the states that surround the nation’s largest estuary.
In more than 1,000 comments from scientists, advocates, regular residents, current and former legislators and even a former Maryland governor, the Chesapeake Bay Program was told that the proposed terms of the plan are too weak, especially considering that the bay states failed to achieve all the goals in the previous agreement .
Commenters, including leading environmental nonprofits, have largely panned the revisions to the expiring 2014 plan. They note that a critical pledge has not been met from that plan, to curb the damaging nutrient and sediment runoff that comes from agricultural fertilizers, human and animal waste and even vehicle emissions.
They took issue with lowered goals for underwater grass acreage and forest buffers, and for failing to mention the legally binding “Total Maximum Daily Load,” a restricted “pollution diet” for the bay set during the Obama administration. The document gives the bay states five more years before new pollution goals must be developed using an upgraded computer model.
And opponents noted the aversion in the new plan to climate change, referring only to “changing environmental conditions.” They faulted Bay Program leaders for not immediately granting a request from seven federally recognized Native American tribes to join as signatories.

“They’re unacceptable,” Patuxent Riverkeeper and longtime environmentalist Fred Tutman said of the revisions. “They’re not going to have the desired effect. How could they? They’re weaker. We’ve been failing with the other measures, and now we’re going to weaken those measures further.”
The new agreement comes as billions have been spent over the years for Bay restoration, which has reduced projected pollution loads into the bay, chiefly through major upgrades at sewage plants. But stemming the flow of pollution from farms — and an ever-increasing amount of developed lands — has proved much more vexing.
Despite those millions, 70.6% of the bay and its tributaries have not attained water quality standards, according to the latest metrics from the Bay Program. That’s compared to 73.5% of the bay in the late 1980s, when the restoration effort got off the ground.
The architects of the new plan face a delicate political situation. States with varying political leanings — not only Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia but West Virginia, Delaware, New York and Washington, D.C. — are all signatories and must agree on the changes. And then there’s the federal government, which signed the 2014 pact, but is also the legal enforcer of the Bay’s pollution diet.
President Donald Trump’s (R) return to the Oval Office has placed the bay restoration effort on a somewhat shaky footing. Trump has slimmed down federal environmental agencies, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the U.S. Geological Survey, amid a broader effort to slash bureaucracy. Trump’s administration has targeted environmental regulations for rollback and attacked renewable energy projects and associated tax incentives.
Unlike his first term, however, Trump first budget proposal this time did not cut funding for the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program, which administers the multistate partnership. Bay Program officials say that federal agencies have remained at the table helping to shape the revised agreement.
But Bay advocates see Trump administration fingerprints on the revisions, including deleted references to diversity initiatives and climate change.
“I would be stunned if that [Trump administration policy] was not at least a significant part of the reason that this is so milquetoast,” said former Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening of the revisions.
But other observers have faulted the bay states just as much as Trump’s EPA.
“Maryland lacks the leadership — the bold leadership — that is necessary in this area,” said Gerald Winegrad, who served in the Maryland General Assembly from 1978 to 1994. “That’s the linchpin of what’s happening here.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) was elected chairperson of the Executive Council of state leaders overseeing by restoration, but Winegrad said he worries that Moore’s alleged aspirations for higher office — Moore has repeatedly denied he is running for president — make him less likely to challenge key industries, including agriculture.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a statement, representatives from the EPA’s Region 3, which includes all of the bay states, emphasized that the revisions “are being made jointly” by all members of the bay partnership, “informed by the public and stakeholders … These are not unilateral EPA actions or decisions.”
“EPA wears multiple hats when it comes to the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) Partnership. Specifically, EPA acts as a funder, regulator, and co-equal partner,” read the statement. “In these roles, EPA does not act alone.”
One particular portion of the agreement caught the attention of
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) led a letter of 23 bay-state members of Congress who argued that the document was not as ambitious as they had hoped. One thing that caught Van Hollen’s attention in particular was the section focused on nutrients, which called for the states to “continue to implement and maintain practices and controls to reduce excess nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment” through 2030.
By December 2030 — when a new computer model that estimates pollution in the Bay region will be completed — the goal would be updated with “revised targets.”
“T​​hey are giving themselves this long lead time — 2030 — to establish some of the goals when it comes to pollution reduction,” Van Hollen said. “I understand the need to gather the data, but it’s also important that between now and then, we continue to work hard to achieve the targets in the current agreement.”
Longtime Chesapeake Bay scientist Don Boesch, a former professor and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, argued that there is no reason to wait for the computer model to take action.
“The model is not going to lower the bar. It’s not going to say you need to do less. It’ll probably say you need to do more,” Boesch said. “So, let’s just do what we said we’re going to do.”

He joined with several other bay scientists from UMCES, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and Cornell in penning comments urging a renewed focus on nutrient reduction, and on new strategies to slow runoff — including by rewarding conservation practices based mainly on how successful they are.
Bay Program officials defended the agreement but indicated that changes could be coming in response to the public’s concerns. That could include a reference to the bay’s TMDL, said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which includes legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia — and is a signatory on the Bay agreement.
“We tried to avoid what we thought were kind of unapproachable terms, like TMDL,” Killius said. “The stakeholders that really pay attention to those things took that as a sign that we are walking away. We can’t walk away.”
Killius said the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Management Board is now taking the comments under advisement. The group will likely adapt the agreement during a retreat at the end of September.
The revised agreement must be finalized by December, when the governors of the bay states will convene for an annual meeting, along with the other signatories of the agreement.
Killius noted that the agreement does call for a 0.2% improvement in water quality each year. And though it may sound “absolutely ludicrous” on its face, it reflects experts’ careful consideration of what is possible, given the bay’s current trajectory, she said.
“You want to stretch beyond what’s comfortable, because that’s how you build muscle,” she said. “We also want to set our managers and our teams up for success.”
Killius added that it is the first time that a Bay agreement has called for measurable improvements in water quality, rather than basing the goal on estimated reductions in nutrient pollution.
In its statement, the EPA’s Region 3 office also defended the way the revisions were written with regard to the TMDL, arguing that the document “provides specific targets that will be developed and a timeline to achieve the new targets,” and further information will come from the new computer model.
Killius said that the team reviewing the comments also heard “loud and clear,” the numerous requests for a consistent timeline, instead of myriad target dates, including 2030, 2035 and 2040.

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, among the largest bay nonprofits, is pushing for the entire agreement to have a deadline of 2035, said Keisha Sedlacek, federal director for the foundation.
The document released for public comment also included a number of blanks, in the place of more specific numerical goals for forest and wetland conservation, among other subjects.
“That’s unacceptable. We can’t ask our governors, the mayor of D.C. and the executive director of the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], to sign a document not knowing what exactly they’re committing to. That’s not fair to the states and jurisdictions. It’s not fair to the public,” Sedlacek said.
In its comment letter, the EPA targeted those passages for removal, writing: “It is EPA’s position that these outcomes/targets lack sufficient detail, are not ready for inclusion in the Agreement at this time, and that the targets should be removed,” read the letter from Lee McDonnell, acting director of the Chesapeake Bay Program office.
The Bay Program also has some soul-searching to do about how low — or high — to set its aspirations, environmental advocates say.
“It just seemed like [they were] trying to set these targets in a way that 10,15, years from now, we can say: ‘Oh, look, we achieved this goal,’” said Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents more than 300 environmental organizations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
“We don’t want to lower the bar just to have success,” Reilly said.



Tribes rebuffed in their effort to get a seat at the table
It isn’t just the terms of the new Bay agreement that are stirring debate — it’s the people who have a seat at the table.
The Indigenous Conservation Council, a group formed in 2022 that includes the seven federally recognized Native American tribes in Virginia, says tribal governments should also be signatories to the agreement. But their request was rebuffed by the Bay Program, said Melissa Ann Ehrenreich, the council’s executive director.
In a June 27 letter, the Bay Program principal’s staff committee said it respected the tribes’ role as sovereign entities, but it was only tasked with revising the Bay agreement, and that adding a signatory would be “outside of our current charge.” It pledged to take the issue to the governors of the Bay states, via the Bay Program’s executive council, for consideration.
“We felt like it was an unnecessary barrier,” Ehrenreich said.
Several groups, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Choose Clean Water Coalition, supported the ICC’s request.
Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission and a member of the principal’s staff committee, said the committee’s hands were tied. But they fully expect to recommend that the tribes are considered for potential inclusion in the future.
“It’s not a ‘no.’ And it’s not like if you miss this boat, we move on,” said Killius, who noted that signatories can be added at any time — not just during the revisions process.
But the delay is still frustrating for the tribes, who say their inclusion should be a no-brainer, and would bring increased knowledge of Native conservation practices to the bay restoration effort.
“The Chesapeake Bay Program is sort of trying to figure out how to keep people at the table,” Ehrenreich said. “And it’s ironic, because tribes want to be at the table.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/river-sunset-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-13 09:56:12.344947

(Courtesy of the University of South Dakota)A program supporting rural and first-generation college students pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical research at the University of South Dakota is among the victims of Trump administration grant cancellations upheld recently by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The court ruled last month that $783 million in nationwide research grants related to health disparities, LGBTQ+ health and vaccines could be terminated by the National Institutes of Health. The Trump administration canceled the grants as part of a crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion-related studies.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The federal government awarded USD $1.1 million over the last five years to start a Graduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement, or G-RISE, program. The university had spent all but $174,661 of the money when the grant was terminated.
University officials had hoped to get a “no-cost extension” to spend the remaining funds for a year beyond the grant deadline, said USD spokesperson Alissa Matt.
The program focused on recruiting and retaining underrepresented students to pursue graduate degrees through the USD Division of Biomedical and Translational Science, Matt added. Associate Professor Lisa McFadden said the program looked for students “eager” to become researchers and enrolled applicants based on academic performance, research potential and commitment to the field.
Several other universities throughout the country have G-RISE programs.
“We were also excited about the chance to use this funding to support first-generation and rural students — two of the groups NIH identified as underrepresented in its initial request for proposals,” Matt said in an emailed statement.
Since 2020, the program financially supported 11 graduate students with stipends. Most of the program’s professional development, mentoring and research activities were open to all USD graduate students.
U.S. Supreme Court gives go-ahead for Trump to cancel $783M in NIH research grants

McFadden said in an emailed statement that students in the program are resilient, creative and determined, “often coming from rural communities where resources are limited, yet proving they can thrive in biomedical research.”
“Their success reflects the values of South Dakota: resilience, resourcefulness, and the ability to do more with fewer NIH resources,” McFadden said.
The program was a “strong fit” for USD, Matt said, because it connected students with meaningful training experiences and improved student outcomes. That included increasing the number of fellowships Biomedical and Translational Science graduates received and an increase in publications per student. The program improved retention, with 100% of G-RISE fellows completing the program, and decreased the time it took an average student to graduate.
The university wants to continue the program, so officials are “exploring other grant programs” to support graduate students, Matt said, including applying for other National Institutes of Health grants.
Programs like G-RISE and other projects committed to supporting South Dakota students, McFadden said, “can help South Dakota retain and grow the biomedical workforce our state needs.”

(File Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)With North Carolina lawmakers still negotiating the state budget, a public forum on Thursday highlighted the state’s long-running Leandro case, a nearly three-decade legal battle over equitable education funding.
Speaking at the forum organized by the advocacy group Public Schools First NC, state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls discussed the history of the case, which began in 1994 when parents and school districts in low-wealth counties sued the state. They argued their students were being denied the state constitution’s guarantee of a “sound basic education.”
The state Supreme Court affirmed that right in 1997 and found that North Carolina had failed to meet its obligation, particularly for at-risk students. Since then, the case has moved through years of court rulings, compliance hearings, and disputes over funding plans.
Earls, who was elected to the state’s highest court in 2018, told the audience she could only discuss the case’s public record, not ongoing proceedings. She read directly from her dissent in a 2022 decision, where she criticized the court’s majority for stepping back from ordering the state to fund a comprehensive remedial plan.
“Not only is it true that justice delayed is justice denied, but denying adequate educational opportunities entails enormous losses, both in dollars and in human potential to the state and its citizens,” Earls read from her dissent. “If our court cannot or will not enforce state constitutional rights, those rights do not exist. The constitution is not worth the paper it is written on, and our oath as judicial officers to uphold the Constitution is a meaningless charade.”
The General Assembly adjourned in late July with no comprehensive deal on the two-year spending plan, passing a resolution to meet only one day a month until the 2026 short session begins in April. Lawmakers have been deadlocked since early summer over tax cuts and spending priorities. That  means months could pass before school districts have clarity on the state’s spending priorities for education.   
Democratic leaders in the legislature and education groups have called on lawmakers to return to Raleigh to pass a full budget. They argue the state needs more than incremental fixes to address increasing enrollment, aging school facilities, and teacher workforce challenges. 
The audience on Thursday also heard from education advocates who connected the case to current classroom struggles. Public Schools First NC have highlighted how Leandro funding could expand pre-K programs, hire more teachers and reduce class sizes.
The Leandro case remains pending before the state Supreme Court, which last heard arguments in February 2024.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P7262843-1536x1152-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-13 07:56:51.903823

Andy Harris (R-1st), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, speaking this week outside the Maryland State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) has appealed the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s denial of nearly $34 million in disaster relief to help Western Maryland areas recovering from a devastating flood earlier this year. Maryland’s sole Republican member of Congress said Moore should look to his own budget before appealing to the federal government for help.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) told Maryland Matters that the flooding is “a tragedy,” but said federal aid was not warranted in this instance.
“Federal emergency aid really should be for very, very large disasters that states can’t afford to cover on their own,” Harris, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, said this week. “The governor just raised taxes $1.6 billion. He probably could find $30 million to send out to Western Maryland.”
“Extreme rainfall” from May 12-14 led to flooding that inundated parts of Allegany and Garrett counties. Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport in Allegany County were among the hardest-hit communities, with floodwaters inundating homes, schools and businesses, washing out roads and damaging pipelines.
The affected counties are all rural, majority Republican and economically challenged areas of the state. The 17.2% poverty rate in Allegany County trails only Baltimore City and Somerset County, both at 20.1%, according to 2023 estimates in the Maryland Manual online. Maryland’s overall poverty rate is 11.1%.
President Donald Trump (R) has called FEMA “a disaster” and said states should handle disaster recovery with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs.
The comments made Monday appear to represent a reversal for Harris, who three weeks ago joined the other nine members of the state’s congressional delegation, all Democrats, asking Trump to approve the aid request.
Cost of Western Maryland flood damage more than doubles; state to appeal FEMA aid denial

“We appreciate the congressman’s stated support for getting the FEMA funding that Western Maryland deserves,” Maureen Regan, a Moore spokesperson, said in a statement responding to Harris’ latest comments. “FEMA funding will be a critical boost to the nearly $1.5 million in disaster recovery and energy assistance that the state has already provided. We just hope the president will listen to the pleas of Mountain Marylanders to help rebuild their towns.”
Deadline? What’s that?
There are many words to describe the letter from 23 members of Congress to the Executive Council of the Chesapeake Bay Program regarding the latest multiyear proposal to clean up the bay: Thoughtful; bipartisan; forceful; forward-looking; thorough.
Late.
The letter is dated Sept. 11, even though the official public comment period for the “Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement Beyond 2025 Revision Draft” closed on Sept. 1, ending a 90-day comment period. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said “our goal was to get it in” by the deadline, but apparently it takes awhile to get 23 House and Senate members in line.
The letter is generally appreciative of the work the Bay Program has done to prepare the document, but says it needs more specifics, and it needs to be written in plain language that regular folks understand. And it says the plan needs to be both broad-based to cover all the challenges the bay currently faces, but also flexible enough to meet challenges that can’t be predicted yet, as new environmental problems crop up.
The letter is signed by eight senators including Van Hollen, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and 15 House members, including six Maryland Democrats: Reps. Kweisi Mfume, Steny Hoyer, Glenn Ivey, Sarah Elfreth, Johnny Olszewski, and April McClain Delaney. All 23 signers are from states in the bay watershed.
Despite the date, Van Hollen’s not too worried about the work behind the letter going to waste.
“From our perspective, we believe that when you’ve got this many members of Congress on a bipartisan basis weighing in that, you know, we expect these views to be taken into account,” he said.
Leave her alone
That was the thrust of an open letter from Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown and 20 other Democratic attorneys general to the U.S. Justice Department recently over its investigation of New York Attorney General Letitia James (D).
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter accuses the department of “pursuing a pattern of harassment and intimidation” after James won financial fraud lawsuit against President Donald Trump (R), then a private citizen. Trump has appealed the ruling that ordered him to pay about a half-billion dollars against him. That award has since been rejected as excessive by a New York state appellate court, which otherwise upheld the ruling against him.
In February 2025, just weeks after Trump was sworn in to his second term in office, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed a “weaponization working group” to investigate “all departments or agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States over the last four years.” Specifically it was directed to investigate James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Special Counsel Jack Smith, all of whom investigated Trump, prosecution of Jan. 6 riot defendants and prosecution of people for blocking access to abortion clinics, among other targets.
“Every aspect of the Department’s campaign against AG James makes plain that it is not rooted in any legitimate suspicion of wrongdoing: President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi are both on record having made public threats against AG James,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote.
The letter also criticizes Edward Martin Jr., a Trump loyalist heading the Justice Department’s working group, pointing to a “crude letter” Martin wrote to James’ personal attorney, caling for her to resign, and later showing up at James’ home to pose for press photographs, according to video obtained by CNN.
“Mr. Martin’s antics and actions amount more to those of a showman than to those of a representative of the United States government charged with ensuring that impartiality, integrity, and fairness are the cornerstones of criminal investigation and enforcement,” the attorneys general wrote.
A representative with the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other attorneys general who signed the letter are from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
When being called bench-warmer is a good thing
Gov. Wes Moore this week tapped “two remarkable servants of the law” to fill vacancies on two circuit court benches, with James J. Dietrich appointed in Montgomery County and Kristina L. Watkowski in Worcester County.
“Throughout their legal careers, James Dietrich and Kristina Watkowski have demonstrated an unwavering dedication to integrity and justice that will serve the people of Maryland well for years to come,” Moore said in a statement Wednesday announcing the appointments.
Dietrich has spent close to 30 years as a prosecutor, beginning his career in the Howard County State’s Attorney’s office, where he served for 21 years and was part of the circuit court trial team for 10 years, and for the last seven years he has been a prosecutor with the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office, serving on the major crimes and post-conviction units.
Dietrich teaches coursed on evidence, criminal procedure and trial practice as an adjunct professor at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law, where he received his law degree. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Lemoyne College.
Watkowski began her legal career clerking for Judges Theodore R. Eschenburg Sr. and Thomas C. Groton III in Worcester County Circuit Court, before moving to the Maryland Office of the Public Defender where she eventually became supervising attorney for the Worcester County office. Since 2022, she has worked as an attorney with Booth, Cropper & Marriner since 2022, with a practice primarily focused on civil litigation with a concentration in land use and zoning.
Watkowski earned an associate’s degree from Howard Community College and her bachelor’s degree from Salisbury University, before getting her law degree at Widener University’s Delaware Law School.

Steny Hoyer's (D-5th) Women's Equality Day Luncheon in College Park. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Whenever Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) walks into a room, he’s usually greeted with hugs, handshakes, kisses on the cheek and gratitude for his more than 40 years in Congress.
But one longtime colleague stood out when she offered those same accolades Friday during the congressman’s 23rd annual Women’s Equality Day Luncheon in College Park attended by a few hundred people.
“Thank all of you for being here and supporting Steny Hoyer over the years,” said former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.), who served as keynote speaker at the event. “When I talk about things that relate to women in the world … [and] having fairness in our society, we can be sure that Steny will be on the forefront.”
Without mentioning President Donald Trump (R) and other Republican leaders by name, Pelosi said there’s been efforts to restrict the women’s right to choose and to appoint women to leadership positions.
“Know that there’s nothing more wholesome for our country, whether it’s in politics and government, whether it’s in the academic world, whether it’s in the military, nothing is more enhanced than by the increased leadership and participation of women,” Pelosi said. “When women succeed, America succeeds.”
Women’s Equality Day is celebrated Aug. 26, to commemorate the 19th Amendment that granted women the right to vote and was ratified in 1920.

Hoyer has three daughters and two of his three grandchildren and three of his four great grandchildren are females. After the death of his first wife, Judy Pickett Hoyer, he remarried two years ago to Elaine Kamarck.
“I have been blessed with a lot of women in my life,” Hoyer said to some laughs and applause in the audience.
Hoyer, who turned 86 on June 14, and Pelosi, 85, have served in Congress together since the 1980s, but have known each other even longer, briefly working together in the early 1960s for U.S. Sen. Daniel Brewster (D-Md.). So when Hoyer makes an appearance these days, he is inevitably asked whether he plans to seek a to 24th term in Congress next year.
“We’re thinking about it,” Hoyer said in a brief interview after the luncheon. “I’m in this fight. This is a fight that is worth having. What is being done in Washington is making America less fair, [there’s] less investment in our future. I’m very concerned about it.”
But those concerns stop at violence, said Hoyer, reflecting on Wednesday’s shooting death of 31-year-old conservative activist, Charlie Kirk during an event at Utah Valley State University.
“We know that there are people who think violence is an alternative — violence is an alternative that will cause chaos and death and diminish our democracy,” Hoyer said. “We need every one of us [to] reject the use of violence, particularly when it comes to political speech. Our democracy believes that debate resolves our differences, not violence.”
In the wake of Kirk’s death, bomb threats were made Thursday to Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and several historically Black colleges and universities. On the same day, the U.S. Naval Academy was locked down after false reports of a gunman on campus led to the accidental shooting of a midshipman. Morgan State University said Friday that it received a bomb threat, that it determined was not credible, but still informed the FBI “out of abundant caution.”
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) — who once. interned for Hoyer — attended Friday’s luncheon and also reflected on the recent events, including a school shooting Wednesday in Colorado.
“I don’t want to keep going down this course, and I just ask everybody to reflect on this moment and the choice that we have here,” said Elfreth, who plans to go forward with an open telephone town hall Monday that was scheduled before the Kirk shooting. “The only way to get through this is to recognize that we all have a part to play in fixing this.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nancy-Pelosi-9-12-2025-1024x927.jpg,,,2025-09-13 08:57:42.175474

It's considered the oldest Jewish synagogue, in continuous usage, west of the Mississippi River. (Marty Nelson/Getty Images)In May 1949, more than 150 people crowded into a modest new synagogue on Bannock Street in Boise. They came not only from the small Jewish community, but also from churches across the city. 
Leaders in attendance included the Rev. Hartzell Cobbs of First Christian Church, the Rev. Herald Gardner of St. Michael’s Episcopal, the Rev. Ray Dunn of First Methodist, the Rev. Robert Ray of First Baptist, Jesse McQueen representing the Latter-day Saints, and Chaplain L. W. Backman of the Idaho State Prison.
The Rev. Cobbs, then president of the Boise Ministerial Association, prayed that the new temple would receive “the highest blessing of the Lord” as its members worked in the “service of God.” It was, as the Idaho Statesman reported at the time, “a milestone in the adventure in faith.”
That milestone is worth remembering. It reminds us that interfaith solidarity is not new to Idaho — it is part of the state’s history.
The Jewish community that built Temple Ahavath Israel in 1949 was small, just twenty members. Yet with donations of money, materials, and labor — from Jews and non-Jews alike — they raised $10,000 to complete Boise’s second synagogue. The achievement earned national recognition in the United Synagogue Review in New York, which praised Boise’s example.
This was not the first time Jewish life in Idaho was publicly noted. As early as 1892, the Statesman reported that Jewish-owned businesses across Boise closed for Yom Kippur, and seventy-five Jews gathered in the Odd Fellows Hall to pray. Three years later, when Congregation Beth Israel incorporated, one of its leaders was Moses Alexander, who would later become governor of Idaho and the first practicing Jewish governor in the United States. That same year, a rabbi addressed the Methodist Episcopal Church in Boise — a conversation grounded in fellowship across traditions.
On Aug. 30, 1896, Beth Israel, Idaho’s first synagogue, was dedicated at State and Eleventh. Shortly after, the Statesman advertised the High Holiday services, treating Jewish observance as part of the city’s public fabric.
During World War II, when Ahavath Israel began holding services for Jewish servicemen stationed at Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Base, space quickly grew tight. The congregation turned to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which hosted Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services in its downtown chapel.
The pattern repeated again in 1961 in Pocatello, where the whole community laid the cornerstone for Temple Emanuel. City officials, the chairman of the Pocatello Ministerial Association, and the mayor of Alameda all attended. One speaker urged that instead of “bigger armies and more destructive weapons,” humanity would be better served by building houses of worship.
These stories show something consistent about Idaho. Time and again, small Jewish communities were met with open doors. Protestant clergy, LDS leaders, and elected officials alike showed up not only in times of crisis but in moments of celebration.
Today, when headlines about antisemitism, civil division, and xenophobia dominate national news, it is easy to forget that pluralism is not new. Idaho’s history offers powerful lessons for our country now. For generations, Idahoans have known something that still matters: showing up for others across difference, working together even while disagreeing about important questions, doesn’t weaken a community’s identity — it strengthens it.
The dedication of a synagogue was not only a Jewish event, but an Idaho event.
Seventy-six years after that day in 1949, it is worth asking: What would it look like to show up for one another across lines of difference today? What can we still learn from the spirit that led Protestants, Latter-day Saints and Jews to stand together on Bannock Street, offering shared blessings for a new sacred space?
It’s not nostalgia — it’s a legacy worth carrying forward.

Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska-Lincoln administrators mapped out $27.5 million in proposed cuts that faculty say will be “devastating” to a campus that has already endured $75 million in cuts over the past six years.
UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett detailed the cuts Friday, including $7.7 million from eliminating six degree programs, $5.5 million expected from buyouts for long-term tenured faculty, $4.6 million from a 1% reduction in state-aided budgets, $3.8 million in “efficiencies” from top administrative offices and four colleges, $2 million from merging four academic departments into two schools and $550,000 less for graduate assistantships.
The plan also seeks “targeted philanthropy” to backfill $2.5 million in mandated tuition remissions, a goal the university hopes to address over the long-term with state lawmakers.
‘An awful day’
John Shrader, president of UNL’s Faculty Senate, said the timeline to offer feedback on the cuts, by Oct. 10, is tight, and he said the damage could take years for the university to repair, “if ever.”
“The professors and the Extension and staff and students have not caused a $27.5 million deficit, but we’re paying for it,” Shrader told the Nebraska Examiner. “We’re the ones who are going to be deeply impacted.”
He added: “It’s just an awful day for the University of Nebraska, no matter how you look at it.”

Jessie Brophy, president of the UNL Staff Senate and director of external engagement and partnerships at the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said that while the Staff Senate recognizes the need for the reductions, staff are deeply concerned about the impact.
“We are committed to representing staff perspectives, supporting our colleagues, and maintaining open communication as the process moves forward,” Brophy said in a statement.
Student leaders for the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska and Graduate Student Assembly did not immediately respond to requests Friday for comment.
Proposed cuts
The academic programs proposed for elimination are:

Department of Educational Administration ($1.95 million, 17 positions)
Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million, 12 positions)
Department of Statistics ($1.75 million, 12 positions)
Department of Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million, 11 positions)
Community and Regional Planning degree programs ($475,000, four positions)
Landscape Architecture degree programs ($225,000, two positions)

In the case of the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, which includes geology and meteorology and climatology, “high-performing faculty” may qualify for rehire in other UNL units “to preserve educational pathways and research expertise.”
The Department of Statistics is a stand-alone department. Undergraduate data science degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering would be retained.
The Departments of Entomology and Plant Pathology would be merged under the proposal, as would the Departments of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication (ALEC). If approved, faculty from the two units would devise a combined name and plan in the spring.
Additionally, there would be fewer graduate assistantships available in the College of Arts and Sciences ($325,000) and College of Engineering ($225,000).

University officials, keeping in line with a promise by NU President Jeffrey Gold, vowed that any students in eliminated programs — freshman or otherwise — would be able to complete their degrees, though making it happen might require compressed timelines or program modifications.
The cuts also would eliminate the remaining $850,000 in state-aided funding for UNL’s Office of Student Life, which a UNL spokesperson said would likely include a mix of programmatic reductions, operational efficiencies and salary impacts. That total is less than 1% of the office’s total budget, which includes student fees, housing and dining.
The Colleges of Business, Engineering, Fine and Performing Arts and Journalism and Mass Communications would need to find a combined $1.1 million in administrative and staff “efficiencies.” 
Bennett’s office, as well as the top academic office and business and finance division, would need to find $2.69 million in unidentified “efficiencies.”
An eye toward ‘efficiencies’
While it’s unclear what these “efficiencies” might look like, some deans have previewed the efforts.


UNL budget reduction proposal
$7.7 million, academic program eliminations
$5.5 million, buyout program for tenured faculty (anticipated savings)
$4.61 million, reducing all state-aided budgets by about 1%
$2.69 million, executive administrative and staff “efficiencies”
$2.5 million, unfunded tuition waivers covered with “targeted philanthropy”
$2 million, department realignments/mergers
$1.1 million, administrative and staff “efficiencies” across four colleges
$850,000, reductions to the Student Life division
$550,000, fewer graduate assistantships in College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering


Dean Shari Veil of the College of Journalism told her college that the “efficiencies” will mean fewer electives, some larger class sizes and additional course sections more dependent on demand and waitlists that might determine whether to offer more sections of courses.
While the journalism college faced no proposals to eliminate majors, Veil said the college will still look at revising its curriculum for “stronger connections” across majors and new courses.
“None of these changes will alter our core mission: to nurture curious and creative minds to thrive in the ever-changing media and communication professions,” Veil said in an email Friday.
Dean Andrew Belser of the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts told faculty and staff something Bennett’s announcement did not: that his college will look at combining its two performing arts schools — the Glenn Korff School of Music and Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film — to work more collaboratively under a shared director.
Belser said the reorganization brings new opportunities and the ability to “open the door to exciting new collaborations,” such as joint projects, shared production support and faster integration of emerging media arts.
“While this reorganization is, in part, a necessary response to budgetary realities, it is designed to make our college stronger and help us better prepare students for the 21st-century creative workforce they are entering,” Belser wrote.
Long-term fix sought
Bennett, in a video message Friday to the campus, said that while UNL and the broader NU system offer a significant return on investment — estimated at $10 for every $1 — UNL has faced declining revenues. That includes net tuition, fewer state funds than anticipated and sharply rising costs for utilities, health care, property and liability insurance.
He said UNL’s structural deficit has “compounded over time” with the latest plan meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles” by eliminating the $21 million deficit but also finding $6.5 million more to trim.

Leslie Reed, UNL’s public affairs director, described the additional cuts as “proactive reductions to better position UNL for the future, so it can break out of this cycle of budget cutting.”
“I am hopeful this work will allow UNL more time to implement long-term strategies for financial sustainability,” Bennett said.
Reed said she was unaware how much of UNL’s cuts are meant to help NU with a systemwide $20 million deficit, which Gold has acknowledged would prove “incredibly painful.”
Since late June 2020, UNL has weathered $75 million in cuts. Bennett joined UNL in July 2023.
Bennett said he appreciates the “sacrifices” many UNL community members have made, including repeatedly being asked to do more with less, which he acknowledged is unsustainable. But the chancellor, whose contract is currently slated to expire at the end of this fiscal year, said now is the time “to boldly reimagine our future.”
Future investment
Top campus leaders evaluated programs and campus areas on quantitative and qualitative data, Bennett said. A university website says the data included program strengths, state needs and workforce alignment.
NU president: Budget cuts ‘incredibly painful’ but ‘necessary’ for university survival

The metrics also had an eye toward a long-term goal to have UNL rejoin the prestigious Association of American Universities, Shrader said. UNL was voted out in 2011 after 100 years as a member.
The AAU particularly praises research and research funding, with campus leaders looking at awards, book publications, citations, unit growth and more.
Shrader, an associate professor in broadcasting and sports media and communications who joined UNL in 2017 said he worries for students and noted that while state leaders repeatedly say they want a Big Ten, Research 1 (R1), first-class university, investments have lagged behind, sometimes at the level of “uninvestment” or disinvestment, he explained.
“We need investment to make this a first-class university, and every year we don’t do that, we slip a little farther behind,” Shrader said.
Executive, legislative fights
Part of the budget deficit for NU as a whole also comes as state appropriations have slowed under Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, who took office in 2023 after serving as an NU regent for a decade.
Pillen has been harder on his alma mater, proposing this January to cut NU’s budget by 2% in the first year of a two-year budget cycle. The NU Board of Regents had requested a 3.5% budget increase in each of the two fiscal years.

In the end, negotiations between Gold and Pillen and legislative will landed at a smaller 0.625% increase this current fiscal year and a 1.25% increase on top of that slower-growing total the following year.
Reed did not answer a reporter’s question on what steps Bennett has taken to engage with state leaders or philanthropic donors, endeavors Gold has been more public about. 
Bennett told the Examiner in 2023 he had been accustomed to being at the Mississippi Capitol about three days a week during its legislative session while he led the University of Southern Mississippi. He had suggested he would do the same in Lincoln.
Reed did not directly answer the Examiner’s question of whether Bennett would seek a contract extension before his contract expires June 30. She said Bennett is committed to leading UNL “toward new levels of excellence well into the future.”
“He expects to continue to serve as long as he is called upon,” Reed said.
‘Long-term consequences’
Sarah Zuckerman, an associate professor of education administration and president of the UNL chapter of the American Association of University Professors, urged campus leaders and regents to reject Bennett’s plan, which she called “extremely short-sighted.”
“They don’t take into account the long-term consequences of closing programs and letting faculty go who are uniquely valuable to the state of Nebraska,” Zuckerman said.

Many faculty speaking to the Examiner also questioned what happens if fewer than expected tenured faculty take the voluntary separation package. Faculty aged 62 or older who have been with NU for at least 10 are eligible. The deadline to apply is Sept. 30.
Most faculty and staff received no pay increases this year due to budget cuts and because UNL has no employee unions, unlike faculty in Omaha and Kearney.
‘Set the stage’
Bennett encouraged the UNL community to offer feedback on the budget reduction plan to UNL’s Academic Planning Committee, an internal working group that includes faculty, staff and students. Feedback is due Oct. 10 and is expected to include public hearings.
The chair of that committee declined to comment Friday and directed questions to Reed.
“We have the opportunity to set the stage for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s next 155 years, and your voice in shaping our future matters,” Bennett said.
Shrader said that while UNL is not a big university, it has a “nice, hard-working community here that impacts the State of Nebraska as much as or more than any other institution in the state.”
“When you do things like this, it can be nothing but detrimental to all of us,” Shrader said. “It can be nothing but a negative impact on every single one of us.”

(Vinegar Syndrome/Roe Bressan/Frameline Distribution)First it was referred to as a “mysterious illness.” Later it was called “gay cancer,” “gay plague” and “GRID,” an acronym for gay-related immune deficiency. Most egregiously, some called it “4H disease” — shorthand for “homosexuals, heroin addicts, hemophiliacs and Haitians,” the populations most afflicted in the early days.
While these names were ultimately replaced by AIDS — and later, after the virus was identified, by HIV — they reflected two key realities about AIDS at the time: a lack of understanding about the disease and its strong association with gay men.
Although the first report in the mainstream press about AIDS appeared in 1981, the first movies to explore the disease wouldn’t come for four more years.
When the feature film “Buddies” and the television film “An Early Frost” premiered 40 years ago, in the fall of 1985, AIDS had belatedly been breaking into the public consciousness.
Earlier that year, the first off-Broadway plays about AIDS opened: “As Is” by William Hoffman and “The Normal Heart” by writer and activist Larry Kramer. That summer, actor Rock Hudson disclosed that he had AIDS, becoming the first major celebrity to do so. Hudson, who died in October 1985, was a friend of President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan. Reagan, who had been noticeably silent on the subject of the disease, would go on to make his first — albeit brief — public remarks about AIDS in September 1985.
Five days before Reagan’s speech, “Buddies,” an independent film made for US$27,000 and shot in nine days, premiered at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco on Sept. 12, 1985.
 
A film on the front lines
If you haven’t heard of “Buddies,” that’s not surprising; the film mostly played art houses and festivals before disappearing.
Its filmmaker, Arthur J. Bressan Jr., was best known for his gay pornographic films, although he’d also made documentaries such as “Gay USA.” “Buddies” would go on to reach a wider audience thanks to a 2018 video release by Vinegar Syndrome, a distribution company that focuses on restoring cult cinema, exploitation films and other obscure titles.
It was inspired by the real-life buddies program at the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, an organization Kramer co-founded. At the time, many people dying of the disease had been rejected by family and friends, so a buddy might be the only person who visited a terminal AIDS patient.
The film feels like a play, in that most of the movie takes place in a single room and features just two characters: a naive young gay man named David and a young AIDS patient named Robert. Over the course of the film, the characters open up about their lives and their fears about the growing epidemic. It also includes a sex scene — something other early AIDS films completely avoided — in which David and Robert engage in safer sex.
 
AIDS packaged for the masses
The remarkably frank and intimate approach to the epidemic in “Buddies” contrasts sharply to the television film “An Early Frost,” which premiered on NBC on Nov. 11, 1985.
The film’s protagonist is a successful Chicago lawyer named Michael who hasn’t come out to his family, much to the distress of his long-term partner, Peter. When Michael finds out he has AIDS, he’s forced to come out to his parents, both as gay and as having AIDS.
Much of the film deals with Michael’s self-acceptance and his attempts to mend his relationships. Yet the production of “An Early Frost” was fraught with concerns about depicting both homosexuality and AIDS. Unlike David and Robert, Michael and Peter show no physical affection — they barely touch each other.


Knowledge of AIDS was still evolving — a test for HIV was approved in March 1985 — so screenwriters and life partners Daniel Lipman and Ron Cowen went through 13 revisions of the script. The real-life fears and misconceptions about how AIDS could and could not be transmitted were central to the storyline, adding extra pressure to be accurate in the face of evolving understanding of the virus.
Despite losing NBC $500,000 in advertisers, “An Early Frost” drew 34 million viewers and was showered with Emmy nominations the following year.
 
A quilt of stories emerges
“Buddies” and “An Early Frost” opened up AIDS and HIV as subject matters for film and television.
They begat two lanes of HIV storytelling that continue to this day.
The first is an approach geared to mainstream audiences that tends to avoid controversial issues such as sex or religion and instead focuses on characters who grapple with both the illness and the stigma of the virus.
The second is an indie approach that’s often more confrontational, irreverent and angry at the injustice and indifference AIDS patients faced.
The former approach is seen in 1993’s “Philadelphia,” which earned Tom Hanks his first Oscar. The critically and commercially successful film shares a number of story points with “An Early Frost”: Hanks’ character, a big-city lawyer, finds out he is HIV positive and must confront bias head-on. HIV also features prominently in later films such as “Precious” (2009) and “Dallas Buyers Club” (2013), both of which, like “Philadelphia,” became awards darlings.
The edgier, more critical approach can be seen in the New Queer Cinema movement of the 1990s, a film movement that developed as a response to the epidemic. Gregg Araki’s “The Living End” (1992) is a key film in the movement: It tells the story of two HIV-positive men who become pseudo-vigilantes in the wake of their diagnoses.

Somewhere in between is “Longtime Companion” (1990), which was the first film about AIDS to receive a wide release and tracks the impact of the epidemic on a fictional group of gay men throughout the 1980s. The film was written by gay playwright and screenwriter Craig Lucas and directed by Norman Rene, who died of AIDS six years after the film’s release.
 
Studios still leery
In many ways, television is where the real breakthroughs have happened and continue to happen.
The first television episode to deal with AIDS appeared on the medical drama “St. Elsewhere” in 1983; AIDS was also the subject of episodes in the sitcoms “Mr. Belvedere,” “The Golden Girls” and “Designing Women.” “Killing All the Right People” was the title of the latter’s special episode — a phrase the show’s writer and co-creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason heard while her mother was being treated for AIDS.
More recently, producer Ryan Murphy has made a cottage industry of representations of queer people, particularly those with HIV. His stage revivals of “The Normal Heart” and Mart Crowley’s 1968 play “The Boys in the Band” were later adapted into films for television and streaming. He also produced “Pose,” a three-season series about drag ball culture in the 1980s that stars queer characters of color, several of whom are HIV positive.
Yet for all of these strides, representations of HIV in film are still hard to come by. In fact, out of the 256 films released by major distributors in 2024, the number of HIV-positive characters amounted to … zero.
Perhaps movie studios are less willing to risk even a character with HIV given the drop in movie theater attendance in the age of streaming.
If you think it’s an exaggeration to suggest that people might not want to be seen going to the theater to watch a film about characters with HIV, the results of a 2021 GLAAD survey may surprise you.
It found that the stigma around HIV is still very high, particularly for HIV-positive people working in schools and hospitals. One-third of respondents were unaware that medication is available to prevent the transmission of HIV. More than half didn’t know that HIV-positive people can reach undetectable status and not transmit the virus to others.
Another important finding from the survey: Only about half of the nonqueer respondents had seen a TV show or film about someone with HIV.
This reflects both the progress made since “Buddies” and “An Early Frost” and also why these films still matter today. They were released at a time when there was almost no cultural representation of HIV, and misinformation and disinformation were rampant. There have been so many advances, in both the treatment of HIV and its visibility in popular culture. That visibility still matters, because there’s still much more than can be done to end the stigma.

(Getty Images)Health insurance rates will increase sharply for the 4 million-plus Floridians who rely on so-called Obamacare plans or small employer health insurance coverage in the coming weeks, according to data released by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.
The OIR reported late last month that, beginning Jan. 1, 2026,  Florida health plans had been approved for double-digit increases in monthly premiums people pay for the individual policies sold on the federal health insurance exchange (healthcare.gov). Florida leads the nation in the number of people enrolled in the exchange.

A 28-year old adult living in Duval County earning $35,000 annually and enrolled in a silver-level individual health insurance plan may pay $281 a month starting Jan. 1, up from $149 now.
Premiums for a family of four earning $85,000 in Duval County will increase to $864 a month after tax credits in 2026, up from $558.
A 28-year-old- living in Miami-Dade County could pay a $322 monthly premium; premiums for such a person in Hillsborough County could total $298 a month. Family premiums in those counties will be $1,019 a month and $932 a month, respectively.
Rates in rural counties will be even higher. Okeechobee County has the dubious distinction of facing the highest premiums in the state: A family of four could pay $1,630 a month and an individual $484 a month.

The OIR posted the information “for illustrative purposes only” on Aug. 25 but did not otherwise publicly announce that it was available online for people to review in advance of open enrollment for 2026 coverage, which starts Nov. 1.
“Posting them on our website is making them public,” OIR spokesperson Kylie Mason told the Florida Phoenix in an email.
The increases in the costs of coverage — coupled with reductions to Medicaid in the 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act (also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill) and programmatic changes to the ACA  — could increase the number of uninsured residents in the state by as many as 730,000 in the next 10 years, a KFF analysis shows. 
Most of those people, 500,000, could become uninsured because of changes to Obamacare — formally the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — and the elimination of enhanced advanced premiums tax credits first made available in 2021 to further lower out-of-pocket costs for people in “silver” level plans.
If the enhanced advance premium tax credits expire, the number of uninsured residents in Florida could increase by another 1.2 million people, the same KFF analysis indicates. Those additional tax payments for co-payments and deductibles are set to expire at the end of the year. The Florida Hospital Association and other organizations want Congress to extend them.
“We’re approaching a healthcare cliff right now,” Florida Decides Healthcare spokesperson Karol Molinares told the Florida Phoenix. The organization is pushing a ballot initiative to place Medicaid expansion before the voters.
“That means ERs being clogged up, people not being able to see their primary-care doctors, uncompensated care. Costs for hospitals are going to skyrocket, which the state is going to be on the hook for. You’re also going to have 50,000 medical jobs that are going to be lost. It’s a whole chain reaction.”
More details
The rate increases affect small-employer coverage, too, because the ACA requires certain benefits and coverage to be included in the health plans small employers offer their staffs.
The rate increases for small businesses aren’t as great as those for individuals and therefore the premium increases aren’t as severe, but remain substantive. The OIR data show costs rising from an average $728 per individual in 2025 to $821 in 2026.
Although Republicans in Florida have not expanded Medicaid to lower-income childless adults, as the ACA allows, the federal health law is popular with residents who annually have flocked to the marketplace for health coverage.
The health exchanges represent a key component of the law, which changed how health insurance can be priced. The law bans insurance companies from medically underwriting the policies and allows rates to be based on four factors only: age, tobacco use, geographic location, and family size. 
Eighteen companies write in the state’s individual health insurance market, including the Community Care Network, a Department of Veterans Affairs health plan providing care outside of VA facilities that operates in Broward County only.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, operating under the Florida Blue moniker, offer policies across Florida’s 67 counties. Its affiliate, Health Options, provides HMO coverage in  64 counties. Centene Venture Co. Florida, meanwhile, is offered in 63 counties.
The OIR released 2026 county breakdowns of potential premiums for a 28-year-old individual earning $35,000 annually and potential premiums for a family of four earning $85,000. (Note: The 2025 county breakdowns showed premiums for individuals earning $34,000 and families of four earning $84,000.)
The OIR examples illustrate the costs of plans as well as costs after the advanced premium tax credits that reduce premiums. The numbers are based on the silver-level health insurance policy, the only plan that qualifies enrollees for additional credits to lower out-of-pocket costs. 
Florida is not alone in these rate hikes — insurers nationwide are filing double-digit increases. A KFF review of marketplace plans submitted by 312 insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia shows that the median proposed increase for 2026 is 18%, more than double last year’s 7% median proposed increase.
Insurers cited rising costs, utilization of services, and the loss of enhanced advanced premium tax benefits as reasons behind the rate increases, according to KFF.
Medicaid expansion needed
According to the most recent OIR data, most people in Florida who purchased health insurance policies in 2023 bought individual coverage on the federal health insurance exchange.The 2023 data show that more than 5.8 million people maintained commercial health insurance policies, and most of those people, 3.6 million-plus, had individual health insurance. 
Nearly 1.8 million people had large-group plans — those sold to businesses with more than 51 employees. Small group policies insured another 400,164 lives in 2023. 
The soaring rates, Molinares said, underscore the need for Florida to expand Medicaid to low-income, childless adults, Molinares said.
“I think Medicaid expansion is the last tool in the tool box to avoid a healthcare cliff that we are barrelling toward if the ACA tax credits don’t get renewed,” she said.

Ned Lamont’s decision to order flags flown at half-staff in honor of Charlie Kirk is not only baffling —it is a disgrace.
In bestowing one of our state’s most solemn honors on a man whose public life was defined by cruelty, bigotry, and division, Lamont has insulted vast numbers of his own constituents—particularly people of color, women, LGBTQ+ folks, and immigrants—whom Kirk worked tirelessly to marginalize and silence.
Let’s be clear: flying the flag at half-staff is not a trivial gesture. It is a civic ritual meant to honor individuals who have served their country or community with distinction, who have elevated public life, who have helped us move closer to our ideals. It is a symbol of collective mourning for someone we believe made us better.
Charlie Kirk did the opposite. He built a career by inflaming our divisions, trafficking in racist and misogynistic rhetoric, and mocking the very people Connecticut claims to protect. As the founder of Turning Point USA, he led a campaign to harass educators, undermine public institutions, and spread conspiracy theories that corrode democratic trust. He did not serve this nation—he desecrated its promise.
While Lamont referenced President Trump’s proclamation that federal buildings fly flags at half staff in his order to do the same at state buildings, Trump’s proclamation is in no way binding on the state of Connecticut. At least two states, including near neighbors New York and New Jersey, appeared to be flying at full staff on Friday. Others simply extended, without comment, their order to lower flags in honor of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. Others mentioned “victims of political violence,” including  Mellisa Hortman, the Minnesota lawmaker assassinated earlier this year. Lamont’s appears to be a deliberate decision to join Trump in honoring a person at odds with the values of the majority of the people of Connecticut, with no connection to the state.
There is no shortage of community heroes in Connecticut who have spent their lives in service who never received such a gesture. Even just under  Lamont’s tenure, we have lost so many organizers, advocates, legislators, and others who all worked toward building solidarity and improving the lives of the people around them, and they were denied the honor that Lamont is now bestowing on a professional bigot.
Connecticut dignitaries like Martin Luther King Jr. associates Thirman L. Milner and Rev. Robert W. Perry, labor organizer and Connecticut House Minority Leader David Puldin, Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn, senior and care workers’ advocate and State Senator Edith Prague, and more have all died in the last several years with no such state honors.
Yet a man who compared the LGBTQ+ community to “a threat to civilization,” who cheered the rollback of women’s rights, who planned a dedicated campaign to chip away at the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., and who applauded political violence now receives state-sanctioned mourning? Why does Kirk, a provocateur with no ties to our state and a legacy of division, deserve more?
Even if Governor Lamont intended this as a gesture of political neutrality, he cannot hide behind decorum when the symbolism is so profoundly wrong. Neutrality in the face of hate is complicity. Mourning Charlie Kirk as a public servant worthy of reverence sends a clear message: that the pain he inflicted is less important than the political convenience of honoring a well-connected figure on the national stage.
This isn’t about partisan politics. It’s about values. It’s about deciding who we lift up, and who we mourn. Should Charlie Kirk have been murdered? No. Should we pretend that he was anything more than the shit-stirrer than he was? Also no. 
Honoring a man like Charlie Kirk with a public display of reverence is a deep betrayal of the communities he harmed —and a troubling sign of whose pain matters to this administration.
Governor Lamont must answer for this choice. And Connecticut residents should demand that our symbols of honor reflect the best of who we are —not the worst of what we’ve allowed.

(Al Persicke / The Reveille) U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Gov. Jeff Landry were among the participants at a vigil LSU held Friday evening for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. 
The event was organized by the LSU chapter of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization Kirk founded and built into an immense political force. 
Kirk, 31, was known for holding events at universities across the country where he engaged in debate with students. Though he was successful in mobilizing young people to support conservative causes, Kirk was a controversial figure for his often inflammatory comments about race, sexuality and religion. His events often sparked outrage from students. 
“I think Charlie Kirk contributed more positive contributions to the free marketplace of ideas than anyone in his generation, and probably in many generations,” Johnson said about Kirk, who he described as a close friend. 
Utah Valley University was Kirk’s first stop on what was meant to be a multi-state debating tour that included a stop at LSU on Oct. 27. 
Kirk was shot within minutes of the event starting. His death sparked immediate condemnations of political violence from across the political spectrum, as well as some further polarizing statements from both far-right and far-left corners. 
“It is important to recognize that the very idea of a representative republic is to allow for the free exchange of ideas that can be debated in a peaceful setting, so that we don’t have to fight it out in the street,” Landry said in a post on X in the aftermath of Kirk’s shooting. 
Kirk’s killing also prompted political figures and universities to rethink security measures for public events. LSU’s vigil required security screenings and was staffed by dozens of law enforcement officers from Louisiana State Police, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office, the Baton Rouge Police Department and the LSU Police Department. 
A suspect in Kirk’s death was arrested Friday and charged with aggravated murder, a capital offense in Utah. Authorities say they intend to pursue the death penalty for 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Little is known about his motivations. 
Savannah Harrison, a Landry aide and former president of LSU’s Turning Point chapter, held back tears while speaking about the impact Kirk had on her life. 
“I was the girl ripping Trump hats off of my classmates’ heads. But through Charlie’s influence, I went from doing that to proudly wearing my own,” Harrison said. “I … embraced the values that still ground me today – God, family, country, and, as Charlie would say, in that order.” 
LSU announced Friday it would launch a lecture series promoting civil engagement and diverse viewpoints in Kirk’s memory. The LSU Foundation is seeking donations to support the series. 
“In the wake of the assassination of American political activist and media personality Charlie Kirk, LSU seeks to be the first university in the country to tangibly re-assert its commitment to civil discourse and freedom of speech,” LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard and interim President Matt Lee said in a joint statement. “LSU has a long history of visible support for free speech … We are therefore well-positioned to take leadership on this front.” 
Lee said he hoped donations would soon come in to support the lecture series but did not know when it would start. 
Some conservatives have sought retribution against those who celebrated Kirk’s death. The Louisiana Republican Party issued a news release highlighting an LSU student who allegedly posted on social media “World famous fascist Charlie Kirk is dead. Rejoice,” and called on the university to take action against the student. 
Ballard said that while he is sad a student feels that way, they have a right to free speech.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ahead of an expected run for governor, former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor is asking the state’s campaign finance regulator to exempt him from a law that requires he disclose who is renting apartments in several Anchorage buildings he owns.
Treg Taylor and his wife Jodi Taylor own the Inlet View Tower in Anchorage as well as two other apartment complexes in South Anchorage and near Midtown.
Under state law, public officials must file an annual financial disclosure form that lists the sources of their income, including rental income, if it is above $1,000. The Alaska Public Offices Commission, which collects and publishes that information, can waive the requirement that a public official provide the identities of his or her renters.
Taylor filed a request for an exemption in March, but that request came after the deadline to submit his 2024 disclosure form.
The Public Offices Commission is perennially underfunded and understaffed, and its electronic submission process doesn’t work properly with rental income, according to a staff report. 
Only 15 out of roughly 1,200 filers have rental income, commission staff said in a written report, and of those 15, only four have more than 20 tenants. The Taylors claim to have 234 renters. 
In a Wednesday hearing, Jodi Taylor asked commissioners to grant the Taylors the waiver, saying that people have tried to talk to their tenants about them.
“I felt like, in this case, people are trolling,” Jodi Taylor said.
She said one of her employees had been threatened with a gun, and that she believed disclosure could pose a safety risk.
Treg Taylor did not participate in the hearing on Wednesday.
Commissioners, who have not yet ruled on the request for a waiver, appeared skeptical of Jodi Taylor’s arguments.
Heather Hebdon, director of the commission, said there was “no legal justification” to exempt disclosure and that there was a substantial public interest in the information.
“The purposes of public official financial disclosures in part are to assure that public officials and their official acts are free from the influence of undisclosed business interests and to allow the public to have access to the information necessary to judge the public officials’ credentials or performance in office,” she said.
Taylor resigned as Alaska Attorney General last month, a position he held since 2021. His last day in office was Aug. 29, and his public appearances both before and after his resignation resemble those of currently registered candidates for the 2026 governor’s race.

Sfraga announced the federal decision in a campus-wide email on Thursday.

Sfraga said the funding cut for UAF is estimated at $2.9 million, and the full effects are still under review. More than 20%, or an estimated 1,450 students at UAF are Indigenous, Sfraga noted. 
The full extent of the grant funding freeze across the University of Alaska system is still being analyzed, said Jonathon Taylor, UA director of public affairs, by email on Friday.
UA President Pat Pitney said in an emailed statement on Friday that the university will continue to create a welcoming environment for all students. 
“We are evaluating the impact these changes will have on our services to Alaska Native students, and are communicating directly with students, staff, and faculty who may be affected,” Pitney said. “A significant part of UA’s identity is our commitment to Alaska Native culture, language, art, heritage, business, and tribal management and governance; that remains unchanged. We proudly embrace our global leadership in Alaska Native and Indigenous studies, and will continue to sustain a welcoming environment where all – including our Alaska Native and Indigenous students – can thrive and succeed.”
Taylor said the University of Alaska Southeast has at least one grant-funded program on the Sitka campus aimed at improving student services, and university officials are waiting to hear whether it will be eliminated. Taylor said the University of Alaska Anchorage does not have any programs funded by this federal grant.
As of fall 2024, there were 3,254 students enrolled at the University of Alaska that identified as Alaska Native or American Indian, and 266 that identified as Hawaiian Native or Pacific Islander, according to the university, and 19,629 students total across the UA system. 
The University of Alaska announcements came after the Trump administration said Wednesday it will withhold an estimated $350 million of congressionally-approved funding for minority serving colleges and universities, saying the money will be allocated elsewhere. The measure continues President Donald Trump’s initiative to eliminate programs that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Sfraga said the federal government is allowing up to a year to close out the programs. UAF has multiple grants which fall under the program, Sfraga said, and most are under the College of Indigenous Studies and the UAF Community and Technical College.
Sfraga said the grant program does not fund student aid, but it does support degree programs and support services like student advising and recruiting, workforce development and student success initiatives across campuses. 
University officials report that to date, the Trump administration has cancelled $6.6 million in research grants and almost $45 million has been frozen.
Each year, the university receives an estimated $250 million in federal research funds, Taylor said, adding that “95% of the university’s broad research portfolio remains intact. UA has experienced only minor disruptions as a result of the rapidly shifting policy picture in Washington, D.C., and we are closely monitoring developments as they evolve.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC09160-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 20:56:50.709425

Jim Pillen’s announcement last month that Nebraska is bringing a federal immigration detention facility to town.

Miguel and Mayra Camacho said they’ve heard other other area merchants describe similar commercial declines. Some Latinos they know have uprooted from southwest Nebraska, spurred by what the couple believes is fear and uneasiness over an increased ICE presence.
“And it’s not even open yet,” said Miguel Camacho, of the facility branded the “Cornhusker Clink” by federal officials. “Of all the 50 states, why here?”
‘People want to know’
Comments the Camachos made this week from their Carniceria — a few miles from where a state prison that holds up to 200 beds is being converted into a 300-bed ICE jail — reflected the sentiment of dozens who spoke against the project during a Friday hearing at the Capitol so full it required an overflow area.
The meeting was hosted by the Legislature’s Urban Affairs Committee. Chairman Terrell McKinney of Omaha offered the space after the chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee declined to hold a public hearing, calling the request premature.
McKinney, a member of both committees, said that while he had been offered a private briefing by the Pillen administration, he opted for a broader discussion open to the public.

He and other committee members said they were concerned about scant information shared about the state-federal plan to repurpose the McCook-based Work Ethic Camp into an ICE detention center for migrants. The state is still trying to relocate the camp’s remaining 155 inmates to different state prisons. Officials said they expect to start housing federal detainees in October.
“Our people want to know, and they’re asking,” said State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, who also sits on both committees. 
“What happens is that when there’s no information provided, negativity and misinformation run rampant,” said State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, the lone Republican committee member who attended the hearing.
On Friday afternoon, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services issued a statement saying that Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys had spoken Thursday with McCook Mayor Linda Taylor and City Manager Nate Schneider about public safety and community impact.
Among the answers Corrections said it provided:

The converted ICE detention center will house an adult population with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies. 
Up to 65 staff positions will be added, all state positions, including additional medical personnel.
The state is exploring options for electronic translation services to assist non-English speaking detainees.
A perimeter fence and intruder petition system will be added, as well as armed patrols around the perimeter.

A formal contract between Nebraska and the federal government is still being hammered out, Correctional Services officials said. 
 Four hours of testimony 

At the four-hour Urban Affairs hearing, about 40 people testified, none in support of the prison conversion that many worry could exacerbate state prison crowding elsewhere to accommodate the feds’ deportation push. 
Many said they were embarrassed. Some choked back tears. Others said they were angry to learn in news reports that the state had invited the Trump administration to consider Nebraska for such a facility.
Nebraskans packed a hearing on a plan to convert a Nebraska prison into an ICE jail. More than three dozen Nebraskans who could not fit into the room waited outside. The front row was reserved for Gov. Jim Pillen staff, which declined to attend, saying the committee lacked jurisdiction to examine the topic. Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Not present were members of the Pillen administration, which told the committee in a Thursday letter it would not participate, arguing that the the Judiciary Committee and not the Urban Affairs Committee had the legal jurisdiction and oversight authority to examine the issues at hand. Pillen’s staff did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
McKinney said he plans to ask the Judiciary Committee chair once again to hold a public hearing that he hopes Pillen’s staff would attend. 
Kenny Zoeller, Pillen’s policy research director, wrote in the Thursday’s letter that McKinney had wrongly suggested that the future migrant population at the center would trigger an overcrowding of the correctional system. Zoeller wrote that an emergency declaration is required when the prison population systemwide is over 140% of operational capacity. He said the average now is about 115%.
“We have flexibility within our current corrections facilities to accommodate this new mission,” Zoeller wrote.
Spike Eickholt, representing ACLU Nebraska, said Nebraska leaders for a decade have debated what to do about state prison crowding. Currently, Nebraska is building a new $310 million-plus prison in Lincoln.
“Why are we committing to an investment of a new prison while giving up a current one?” he asked.
Other speakers lamented the loss of the Work Ethic Camp’s rehabilitative focus and programming aimed at transitioning criminal offenders for successful re-entry into society.
 Nebraska’s role in deportation

But most of Friday’s testimony centered on Nebraska’s role in Trump’s push for mass deportations. Pillen has said he is proud to be part of the president’s effort to “make sure we keep our community safe.”
“This stuff hits close to home and hits every corner of this state an country,” the governor has said.

“Are we willing to risk that and be made a joke nationally as the ‘Cornhusker Clink’ — for money that we may or may not get — and that breaks all values of Nebraska?” she asked.
Guillermo Enrique Peña Valladares of Grand Island said he comes from a family of immigrants and that federal enforcement tactics have created anxiety and intimidation even among those legally in the country for generations.
“Should I fear saying my name?” he asked, voice cracking. He said his family works in meatpacking plants and his mom speaks broken English. “Every day we have to ask ourselves, ‘Are we going to be alright?’”
As his family’s first college graduate, Peña said, he felt a responsibility to speak out.
“You are trying to imprison the agricultural hands of Nebraska. They are already battered and bruised,” he said.
Anne Wurth, associate legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said a worry is the “lack of planning” and demeaning behavior by ICE toward migrants.
She said her nonprofit saw it first hand, representing several of the 78 workers detained in the June 10 immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods. Wurth described, for example, the early 48 hours when some families did not know where relatives were being held and said some wounds went untreated.
“Their goal is to terrorize immigrants,” she said of the federal government. “They continue to demean and dehumanize a population that is integral to the state of Nebraska … We must not do this for them.”
 ‘Pissed off grandmas’ 

Don Hooper, a retired educator, was among several who decried the politics. He said he does not want “Cornhusker Clink” to join Nebraska’s “good life” and “home of Arbor Day” signs on the highway.

If the facility comes, he said: “It should be named … ‘Pillen’s prison’ in honor of the individual who wants this in Nebraska.”
McKinney said he appreciated a petition opposing the immigration detention center coordinated by Nebraska Appleseed, as it reflected statewide opinions. Appleseed’s Ruby Mendez said the effort collected more than 18,000 signatures from people in nearly 400 Nebraska communities.
Faith Colburn said she drove in from North Platte with concerns about legal and other services that migrants would have available in McCook. 
“I’m here representing 50 people,” she said. “Many of them are furious, pissed off grandmas.”
About 650 people also submitted written testimony to the Urban Affairs committee. Because it was for an interim hearing, McKinney said, the correspondence had not been categorized into opponents, proponents or neutral.
 Carniceria survival plan  

In McCook, Miguel and Mayra Camacho said they would not close shop, and hope that business picks up.

The family’s move six years ago from Kansas to the Nebraska community of about 7,200 people was calculated, they said. The area has a Walmart and other key stores that draw residents of surrounding towns.
Their two kids attend local schools, and have felt a sting from the proposed ICE facility. A classmate asked their daughter if she had seen her “new house,” said Camacho.
The small business owners said they are trying to form a group to provide information and support to Latinos in the community. They said they’ve enjoyed the McCook area and their patrons. 
The couple rode out the COVID-19 slump, opening the Carniceria’s doors every day. Gesturing toward the empty store and restaurant, Camacho said the plan now is to do the same: “Stay here, protect it, survive.”
He added, ‘If the community tells me I’m not welcome, we’ll move.”

The Nature Conservancy conducted a three-year pilot project on the technology. (Photo by Dale Maxson/The Nature Conservancy)Cattle at a nature preserve in eastern Iowa appear to roam the land freely — no fences or cowboys on horseback patrol their movement. 
Instead, these cows wear special collars that keep them from grazing beyond the boundaries their owners designate via a phone or computer. 
The Nature Conservancy has studied this form of virtual fencing with cattle at its Land of the Swamp White Oak Preserve for the past three years with the hope that the technology can be integrated into other ranchers’ operations. 
Amy Crouch, The Nature Conservancy’s Little Sioux project director who headed the virtual fencing project, said the collars can give ranchers peace of mind, reduce labor on managed grazing operations and help put cattle onto more land.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With the collars, producers can do things like easily keep cattle from grazing — and therefore defecating — in vegetation near a stream, which protects water quality. They also know where a cow is if it gets out of bounds, and they are alerted if a cow has not moved for a certain period of time. 
Crouch said she grew up with milk cows and remembers the feeling of being tethered to the farm to take care of the cows. 
“I imagine it’s the same for a lot of these producers who do the intensely managed grazing, where they’re moving them all the time,” Crouch said. “If they could have this labor-saving device, so they can concentrate on doing other things too, how tremendous.”
But, the technology is still relatively new to the country, which is why Crouch said The Nature Conservancy decided to run a pilot project. Now, interested Iowans have somewhere to learn about the technology and how it might work on an Iowa landscape. 
How does the virtual fence work? 
Crouch said The Nature Conservancy project started around 2021 when a company from Norway appeared at a Practical Farmers of Iowa event and told her about the virtual fence technology. 
“Think of it like an invisible dog fence,” Crouch said, explaining how the virtual fencing works. “But a little more sophisticated and complicated.” 
Cows are suited up with a GPS-enabled collar that sits on their necks like a stereotypical cow bell.
Then, cattle are moved into a traditionally fenced paddock, but with one open side. Operators use a computer or smart phone to set the virtual fence around the open side so the cows can learn how the fence works.

When cattle get a certain distance from the virtual fence line, they’re sent an auditory tone, then another louder tone as they get closer and finally if they get too close the collar gives a vibration. Crouch said the collar doesn’t give a shock, but the vibration is unpleasant to the cow. 
“They catch on so fast,” Crouch said. “They hear that tone, and they don’t even stop grazing, they just change direction and go a different way. So it’s really, really easy on them, and it’s easy on the farmer too.” 
Once the cows are trained on the collars, farmers can move the cows to a fully virtual-fenced paddock and use the technology to move the cattle, gradually through different grazing areas. 
The collars are solar charged, so once they’re on the cows, farmers don’t have to worry about trying to wrestle with a cow to switch out a battery. 
Crouch said occasionally they have had issues with cattle sitting under tree shade most of the day and losing charge on their collars, but she said ranchers in more open spaces might not have to worry about that as much.
Benefits of virtual fencing
Producers who use highly managed grazing techniques, or grazing that strategically moves the cattle through different pastures to balance manure and plant regrowth, typically move their cattle every day or every couple of days. Crouch said the virtual fence would save hours of labor for these types of operations, which are believed to improve soil and water quality. 
At the Land of the Swamp White Oak Preserve, Crouch said staff used the virtual fence to encourage cattle to chomp down on areas with an invasive species and then to stay out of sensitive areas like a wetland. 
But even for producers who don’t move their cattle as frequently, Crouch said the virtual fence alleviates a lot of time and a lot of worry, because farmers can see exactly where each head of their herd is with one glance at the application. 
It also saves time on fence management. With a virtual fence, farmers no longer have to spend time setting up and repairing fence lines.
Research into virtual fencing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Northwest Climate Hub found the technology could even be beneficial to ranchers who operate in areas susceptible to wildfires. While traditional fencing would burn, farmers could quickly adjust their virtual fence boundaries to keep cattle away from burned areas, or areas susceptible to fire. 
“Theoretically, you could have a cornfield in the middle of your pasture and they’d stay out — well, you know, as much as cattle can resist that,” Crouch said with a laugh. “The push and pull of the unpleasantness (from the collar deterrents) or corn.” 
A herd equipped with a virtual fence system could also graze the cover crop on a neighboring field, or the back corners of a field that would otherwise be too hard to put cattle on with traditional fencing. 
“The potential for all of that is just huge,” Crouch said. “…that’s one of the huge things, getting cattle back on the land.”
Implementing
Crouch said the collars and technology are slightly more expensive than the cost of installing a new fence. But, she said the year-to-year cost of fence maintenance and labor, give the virtual fencing an advantage over traditional fencing. 
Crouch said she has been “very impressed” by the durability of the collars even though they’re outside and on a cow 24/7. 
“They’re dunked in water tanks and rolled on the ground and smacked on trees and they’re fine,” Crouch said. 
The hardest part, she said, is learning to put the collars on. 
That’s why The Nature Conservancy wanted to launch a pilot project. Now, farmers who are interested in implementing the technology have someone local to turn to with questions. 
Each August, the conservancy has led a field day for interested parties to learn about the collars and how they have worked on an Iowa landscape, though this year’s field day was canceled due to flooding. 
The field days give farmers the opportunity to see how the technology works, before they decide to invest thousands of dollars to implement the system in their operation. 
“They’re able to see it practically before deciding whether they want to implement it on their own place,” Crouch said.

(Photo courtesy of Public School Employees of Washington.) School is finally back in session following a three-week delay at Evergreen Public Schools in southwest Washington, after unionized staff approved a deal with district administrators. 
Members of  Public School Employees of Washington  SEIU Local 1948 initiated the first strike in the union’s 57-year history on Aug. 26 following months of failed contract negotiations. 
The union represents 1,400 paraeducators, bus drivers, security officers, maintenance workers and other “classified” non-teacher staff at Evergreen Public Schools. They demanded that the district adequately compensate paraeducators, who assist teachers with classroom instruction, and address what the union described as critical understaffing.
“This agreement is the product of incredible strength and unity from Evergreen’s classified staff,” said Mindy Troffer-Cooper, president of the Evergreen chapter of Public School Employees of Washington.
The  Evergreen Public Schools board last week authorized its legal team to take “all lawful steps necessary” to end the strike, including filing a request in Clark County Superior Court for an injunction to force striking employees back to work. 
The district and union negotiators reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday, with union members voting to approve the agreement Thursday night. 
Class resumed on Friday, Sept. 12. The district has about 22,000 students.  
“Our members stood strong in the face of legal threats and misleading tactics because they knew what was at stake: stability for students, livable wages for staff, and respect for the work that keeps schools running,” Troffer-Cooper said. 
She attributed the success of the strike to solidarity across the labor community, thanking teachers, parents, students, community allies and other labor partners for supporting Evergreen’s classified staff. 
La Center educators to return to class, as Vancouver workers authorize a strike
Teachers at La Center School District in southwest Washington ended a week-long strike on Thursday after reaching a tentative agreement with the district. 
Members of the teacher’s union began striking Sept. 3. They sought higher wages to retain and attract quality staff and compete with neighboring districts.   
Union members planned to vote on the agreement on Friday. If approved, school will reopen on Monday, Sept. 15. Classes started in La Center on Aug. 27 and paused on Sept. 3. 
“We are looking forward to welcoming students back to their classrooms,” said Superintendent Peter Rosenkranz. 
Meanwhile, classified staff at Vancouver Public Schools voted Thursday to authorize a strike. 
A start date for the strike had not been announced as of Friday afternoon. 
Members of the Vancouver Association of Educational Support Professionals failed to reach an agreement after months of negotiations and have been without a contract since Aug. 31. 
The union represents over 800 paraeducators, clerks, secretaries, tech support specialists, maintenance workers and other staff. 
Union members are asking for additional training, increased staffing, shortened time between salary increases, and pay hikes for inclement weather and work-related injuries. 
“We deeply respect our VAESP labor partners and appreciate schools cannot run without these staff,” Vancouver Public Schools says on its website, adding that bargaining is “especially difficult right now” due to funding not matching the actual costs of operations. 
 
“We are all left trying to find a way to make sure our students and staff get what they need, and deserve, even with our very limited resources,” Vancouver Public Schools adds in its statement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/535236158_1176010081225818_3430053679891650139_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634
,California,2025-09-12 23:36:44+00:00,CalMatters,California Legislature overrides local zoning to boost transit-oriented development,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/09/neighborhood-transit-upzoning/,"The bill, among the most controversial housing proposals in recent memory, overcame opposition from local governments, organized labor unions and many legislative Democrats.","In summary
The bill, among the most controversial housing proposals in recent memory, overcame opposition from local governments, organized labor unions and many legislative Democrats.


California lawmakers just laid the groundwork for a highly targeted building boom.
Senate Bill 79, authored by San Francisco Democrat Sen. Scott Wiener, would “upzone” neighborhoods immediately surrounding train, light rail and subway stations in many of the state’s most populous metro areas. That means apartment developers will be able to construct residential buildings — some as tall as 75 feet — regardless of what local zoning maps, elected officials or density-averse neighbors say. 
In a legislative year teeming with controversial housing bills designed to kick-start more construction in California, SB 79 has been among the most controversial. Because it would override the planning decisions of local governments, the bill had to overcome opposition from a host of city governments and their defenders in the Legislature, while fracturing the Capitol’s reigning Democratic Party over questions of affordability, labor standards and who ultimately has the final say over what gets built where.
The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom who supporters expect will sign it.
Wiener’s bill is meant to address two crises at once: The state’s long-term housing shortage and the financial precarity of its public transit agencies. By allowing taller and denser development, the legislation is meant to pave the way for more apartment developments in areas closest to jobs and services. By centering that development around public transit stations, it’s meant to steer more people away from cars and towards buses and trains. 
“Decades of overly restrictive policies have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people away from jobs and transit and into long commutes from the suburbs,” Wiener said in a statement after Friday’s vote. “Today’s vote is a dramatic step forward to undo these decades of harm, reduce our most severe costs, and slash traffic congestion and air pollution in our state.”
SB 79 would also give transit agencies the ability to develop their own land, giving them another potential revenue source — a financial model common across East Asian metros.
Making it easier to build on and around public transit stops has been a career-spanning effort for Wiener, who first introduced a version of the idea in 2018. That measure died in its first committee hearing. Wiener tried again in 2019 and 2020, but was never able to push the idea out of the Senate. 
That’s all helped to bestow the proposal with a kind of mythic status in California’s legislative housing wars. Its success at last slaps a symbolic bow on a year marked by the state Legislature’s unprecedented appetite for pro-development bills. Earlier this year lawmakers made national news in exempting most urban apartment projects from the state’s premier environmental review law.
California YIMBY, one of the sponsors of the bill and a vocal force in the Capitol for pro-construction legislation, was quick to take a victory lap after the final vote in the Senate this afternoon.
“Today, California YIMBY achieved one of its founding goals — legalizing apartments and condos near train stations,” said the organization’s CEO Brian Hanlon in a written statement. “We won many victories over the past eight years, but the dream of passing a robust, transit-oriented development program has long eluded us, until now.”
For opponents of state-imposed density measures, the vote marks an equally weighty defeat. 
Susan Kirsch, founder of Catalysts for Local Control, a nonprofit that advocates for the preservation of municipal authority over housing policy, predicted that the legislation would have a “devastating impact” on California’s low-rise neighborhoods, describing “extreme seven-story buildings next to single-family homes with nothing that the community can do about it.”
Amended to victory
The secret to Wiener’s success this year after so many past failures may be his willingness to whittle the bill down.
Over the course of the year, the proposal underwent 13 rounds of amendments — more than any other policy bill. Many of those changes were made to convince powerful interest groups to drop their opposition. That often meant reducing the bill’s scope.
The legislation would only apply to  counties with at least 15 passenger rail stations. According to its sponsors, just eight counties fit the bill: Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Santa Clara, Alameda, Sacramento, San Francisco and San Mateo. 
That’s a concession that likely softened opposition from rural and suburban legislators. 
Rather than applying to every major bus line in the state, as the 2018 iteration did, SB 79 only targets homes within a half mile of train stations, subway stops and “high-frequency” light rail and commuter rail stops. Buildings within the nearest quarter mile of Amtrak stations, Bay Area Rapid Transit stops and Los Angeles subway stations can top out at roughly seven stories. But parcels further out or surrounding less-trafficked light rail stations would be capped at more modest heights.

The legislation also comes with asterisks about the kinds of projects that can make use of its provisions. Developers, in select cases, must hire unionized construction workers — a provision that convinced the powerful State Building and Construction Trades Council to drop its opposition. 
Projects must also set aside a modest share of homes for lower-income residents (at least 7%) and replace any rent-controlled units that are destroyed during construction. Lower-income neighborhoods also have more time to plan for the rezoning with the new rules not taking effect until at least 2032. That compromise led a number of tenant rights,“housing justice” advocacy groups and other affordability advocates to stand down earlier this week.
Case in point: Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat who, as chair of the Senate’s Housing committee, nearly killed the bill earlier this year, was the second to speak in favor of it on Friday. 
In a fig leaf to ticked off local governments, the bill also allows cities that are already planning for transit-oriented apartment buildings at a significant scale, such as San Francisco and Sacramento, to stick with those plans rather than abide by the full scope of the new law. 
“If you look at the bill and you read the bill, I actually view it as a thoughtful, relatively narrow-in-scope bill,” Oakland Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland and frequent political ally of Wiener’s on housing matters, said on the Assembly floor Thursday. 
Reshaping the American Dream
Many of her fellow legislators, Democratic and Republican alike, disagreed.
The Senate ultimately passed the bill by the narrowest possible margin, with Wiener only claiming his final vote from Bakersfield GOP Sen. Shannon Grove after a few tense minutes. The Assembly vote was equally close, with just 43 of the chamber’s 80 members supporting it. 
“This blunt, one-size-fits-all bill will not work for a district like mine,” said Assemblymember Rick Chavez-Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat who represents portions of Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Hollywood. “For many Californians, living in a single-family neighborhood fulfills a lifelong dream — the American Dream.”  
Placing apartment blocks in those neighborhoods “has the potential to fundamentally reshape my district without the benefit of careful land-use planning,’ he said.
Zbur was partially channeling opposition from his counterparts in local government. Last month, a narrow majority on the Los Angeles City Council voted to oppose SB 79, which members characterized as a Sacramento power grab and a giveaway to real estate developers. The city is one of dozens of municipalities that came out against the measure.

Supporters counter that deferring to local governments on land use decisions has resulted in a chronic undersupply of new housing, as local elected officials have historically catered to the interests of change-averse homeowners. 
Marc Vukcevich, a policy director for the LA-based transit and pedestrian advocacy group Streets For All, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he didn’t think the city of Los Angeles’ opposition to the measure carried much weight.
“The Legislature knows that LA is a deeply unserious actor when it comes to housing,” he said.
Most significant housing bill ever?
For all the concessions Wiener made along the way, backers of the bill are still calling the proposal historic.
“It’s by far the biggest housing bill the California Legislature has passed,” said Matthew Lewis, a spokesperson for California YIMBY. “There’s more to do, but it’s a major, major step. And honestly, I feel like as people start to see what is actually going to happen, the politics will start to change too.”
“The fear is Hong Kong. I think the reality is going to be something closer to Copenhagen — not everyone is going to build the maximum demand,” he said.
Whether homeowners in Palo Alto, mid-city San Diego and the San Fernando Valley ultimately come to appreciate the new apartment developments in their communities will depend on whether any get built in the first place. 
Past upzoning efforts in California have proven to be more ambitious on paper than in practice. In 2021, state lawmakers passed Senate Bill 9, a measure that both supporters and opponents said would end single-family zoning in California by allowing homeowners to build up to four units on their property. Four years in, the law has resulted in precious few units. Housing advocates point to costly requirements and loopholes that made the law difficult for property owners to actually use.
Simon Büchler, an economist at the Miami University in Ohio who has studied the results of different upzoning policies, said developers are generally keen to build around public transportation stations, making SB 79 a promising approach.
“The success of upzoning depends crucially on where it happens,” he said in an email. “Ideally, you want to upzone in high-demand areas with strong transit connections, since those are the places where added density will translate into meaningful increases in supply.”
In any case, the changes will be gradual. “Supply increases take time (often many years) to materialize, even in the right places, so these policies are far from an overnight solution,” he said.
Cobbling together enough single-family homes in a desirable transit-adjacent neighborhood is easier said than done, said Mott Smith, a developer and board member of the California Infill Builders Association. Land values are steep. Finding enough sufficiently large land all in one place requires a fair bit of luck. Both make it hard to profitably build a six-story apartment building. 
“We will probably see in the next five years 20 to 30 SB 79 projects around the state, that’s my wild guess,” he said. “Both the opponents and the proponents of the bill are probably overstating how much this is going to change the built environment in California.”
That could be especially true in the current economic climate. Tariffs on building goods, immigration crackdowns targeting construction workers and high interest rates show no sign of abating, factors that make it hard to build — close to a train station or not.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_Oakland-Housing_AW_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers decided Friday to release withheld funding to 40 cities and towns and give them extra time to update the state on required water and sewer system audits.
The decision came after the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee spent two hours debating whether to give the municipalities further grace for their unfiled 2022 audit reports, which were due to the state July 1, 2024. Each municipality must provide the delinquent report to Arkansas Legislative Audit by Dec. 31 or an engagement letter with a certified public accountant promising the report will be submitted by that date. Lack of compliance will result in the state withholding funds again.
Local governments receive two types of “turnback funds” from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
In order to receive turnback funds, municipalities must file audits of their water and sewer systems with Arkansas Legislative Audit no later than 18 months after the end of the audit’s fiscal year. Act 453 of 2023 states that lawmakers can ask the state treasurer to withhold the funds if a municipality misses the 18-month deadline, and the funds can only be restored if the municipality submits all its reports through the most recent fiscal year.
The Counties and Municipalities subcommittee of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee voted in July to authorize the treasurer’s office to withhold these funds from 43 cities and towns whose 2022 water and sewer audits were outstanding at the time.
Since July, the municipalities of Delight, Horseshoe Lake and Pollard had their funding restored after submitting their reports for fiscal years 2022 through 2024, according to a list of delinquent municipalities Deputy Legislative Auditor Joe Archer provided the Advocate.
Of the remaining 40 municipalities, 14 have submitted their 2022 audit reports, according to the list, and nine have also submitted their 2023 audit reports. The remaining 26 municipalities have yet to submit any water and sewer audit reports for the past three fiscal years.
Turnback funds are disbursed on the 10th of every month, meaning the 40 municipalities did not receive their usual September disbursement. The two months of withheld funds from the municipalities total $477,797.71, according to data treasurer’s office fiscal director Kathie Williams provided the Advocate.

 
 Committee debate

Sen. David Wallace, R-Leachville, was one of Act 453’s sponsors. He proposed the grace period until Dec. 31 and the release of the 40 municipalities’ turnback funds at Thursday’s Counties and Municipalities subcommittee meeting.
Wallace’s motion passed the subcommittee, but members of the full committee balked Friday when asked to approve the subcommittee’s actions.
Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, proposed that the committee vote separately on the turnback funds issue because the subcommittee’s decision might be “in direct conflict with state law.” Womack’s motion failed on a roll call vote.
There were no representatives present from the Attorney General’s office to comment on the legality of Wallace’s proposal. Legislative Audit Legal Counsel Emily White said the proposal implied that the 40 municipalities were “in compliance” with Act 453 “when based on our interpretation of the law, they might not be.”
White pointed out that Act 453 does not give the state treasurer’s office any discretion not to withhold turnback funds if lawmakers notify the office that a municipality’s audit reports are late.
Wallace said lawmakers’ responsibilities include making decisions outside of regular legislative sessions and “not to hide behind the bureaucracy.”
“If we can’t come down here and make decisions that affect our state, we might as well go ahead and stay home and play dominoes,” Wallace said.
The committee accepted the subcommittee’s report, including the release of the turnback funds, on a roll call vote with 16 members voting yes. The decision authorized the Republican co-chairs, Rep. Robin Lundstrum of Elm Springs and Sen. Jim Petty of Van Buren, to notify the treasurer’s office that the body rescinded its July referral of the delinquent municipalities.
Lundstrum was among the 12 lawmakers to vote against the motion, calling it “dangerous uncharted territory” for the committee to effectively change a provision of a law.

Rep. Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, also opposed the motion. She said she disagreed with Wallace that lawmakers can make decisions about how to apply laws outside legislative sessions.
“Whether you like the law or not, that’s what we voted on as legislators,” Mayberry said. “If it needs to be changed, then we need to do something to do it the right way. This is not the right way to do it. This is allowing a small, little group of people the power to override the rest of the members here.”
 Local impact

Lawmakers who supported releasing the turnback funds said cities and towns in their districts were struggling and would continue to struggle if they lost more monthly income.
Rep. Mark McElroy, R-Tillar, said “small towns in the Delta” have few accountants at their disposal. He also said local governments have higher priorities than completing audits, such as providing safe water and sewer services.
Rep. Howard Beaty and Sen. Ben Gilmore, both Crossett Republicans, also said the withheld funds directly impact their constituents. 
“We’re not changing law by taking this action,” Beaty said. “We’re giving grace to some communities that need it, some of the most impoverished communities that we have in the state.”
Beaty and Gilmore represent Lake Village, a city of about 2,000 people that had nearly $34,000 withheld in August and September.
The city froze its spending and hiring in response to the funding shortage, Lake Village Mayor Eddy Bush told the Advocate. He said the city has already provided the state a letter of engagement with an accountant promising the completion of the required audits by Dec. 31.
Bush and Elaine Mayor Lisa Hicks-Gilbert both said they were relieved to learn that their cities will receive their regularly scheduled turnback funds for the rest of the year.
The roughly $4,000 per month in turnback funds makes up the largest revenue source for Elaine, Hicks-Gilbert said. The city of just over 500 people is in McElroy’s district and has no local sales tax to bring in additional revenue.
Elaine residents rejected a ballot measure to create a local sales tax last year. Hicks-Gilbert said she urged citizens to support the measure in case the city’s state funding stopped or became precarious.

The funding shortage forced the city not to make some purchases, and it would have had to make budget cuts if lawmakers hadn’t decided to restore the funding, Hicks-Gilbert said.
“$4,000 or $5,000 is not a lot of money, but it is when it’s all you have to fall on,” she said.
Like Lake Village, Elaine has obtained letters of engagement from accountants who should complete the audits by year’s end, Hicks-Gilbert said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wallace_MJohnson-scaled-e1757717723194-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)BELLEVUE — Top U.S. House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries traveled here Friday to decry rising health insurance costs he says are driven by recent actions from congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.
Low-income Americans face the combination of steep cuts to Medicaid in the years to come and the looming expiration of federal tax credits that help them afford insurance coverage. 
Premiums for individual insurance bought on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange through the Affordable Care Act are set to rise an average of 21% next year, state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer announced this week. 
This hike is in line with similar jumps across the country. Last year’s average rate increase was 10.7%. The state has to approve the rate increases if they’re actuarially justified. 
Jeffries said he’s willing to risk a government shutdown if Republicans don’t reverse what he sees as an assault on health care. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government.
“Democrats will support a bipartisan spending agreement that is negotiated between the House and the Senate, if it lifts up the quality of life of the American people, with a focus on three areas, their health, their safety and their economic wellbeing,” said Jeffries, a New York congressman. “We will not support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people.”
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday he and Jeffries are united in opposing any funding plan that doesn’t include their health care demands.
Jeffries appeared at a press conference at Overlake Medical Center, alongside Gov. Bob Ferguson, state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer and U.S. Reps. Suzan DelBene and Kim Schrier.
“It’s great to be with folks who are smart and strategic and substantive and be able to say I’m in Washington at the same period of time,” Jeffries quipped.
He was set to participate in a Seattle-area fundraiser Friday evening for DelBene hosted by state Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove. DelBene chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Subsidies set to expire
Nearly 300,000 residents buy health plans through the exchange, which serves people who don’t get coverage from their work or don’t qualify for public programs like Medicaid, known in Washington as Apple Health, or Medicare. Three-quarters of those Washingtonians qualified for federal premium tax credits that helped drop annual premiums an average of $1,330. For seniors, those savings jump to more than $1,900 annually, according to Ferguson’s office.
But those subsidies, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic, will expire at the end of the year without congressional action. In July, the exchange reported the expiration would lead to 80,000 people in Washington choosing to forego coverage. 
Those who choose to go without insurance are more likely to be healthy, likely fueling further premium hikes for those who remain insured, as the insurance pool would be less healthy overall and more risky for insurers. Nationwide, costs for insurance on the marketplace are estimated to rise more than 75%, with more than 4 million people going uninsured, according to the nonpartisan health research group KFF.
Some Republicans have expressed an openness to extending the tax credits, even if just for one year.
The uninsured rate in Washington was 4.8% as of 2023. For years, the state made progress getting more people health insurance, but officials say that headway is now threatened.
“We’ve come far in making healthcare more accessible and affordable, but we still have much more work to do,” said DelBene, D-Medina. “We should be talking about what we do to go forward, not going backward.”
Overlake CEO and President Jon Duarte anticipates hospitals will have to deal with providing more uncompensated care, straining their finances, if the subsidies are allowed to expire.
Kuderer said Congress needs to act quickly if lawmakers are going to extend tax credits, as her office would need to approve revised rates in time for open enrollment, which begins Nov. 1 and lasts until Jan. 15.
The Washington Health Benefit Exchange Board plans to ask the state Legislature for tens of millions of dollars in funding to mitigate the loss of the tax credits.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Meanwhile, the state is also bracing for drastic cuts to Medicaid that Congress passed in the so-called “big, beautiful bill.” 
The stated goal is rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the insurance program for low-income Americans. 
Critics here in Washington say new work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and other changes in the law could cost the state billions per year in federal funding, force hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians to lose coverage and strain hospitals. 
The work requirements don’t take effect until January 2027, so it will take a while to know the effects of the law, a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy agenda.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4463-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

Sept. 11, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz/Michigan AdvanceANN ARBOR – At the intersection of Fuller Road and Medical Center Drive outside the University of Michigan hospital in Ann Arbor, a wave of chants criticizing the health care institution echoed alongside shouts and honking of drivers.
The scene was a show of frustration and anger, all in support of transgender youth who will now be denied gender affirming care due to the hospital system’s decision to end that care.
At least one hundred demonstrators, carrying signs and waving transgender flags, were there among students and community members who gathered Thursday afternoon to protest the decision following federal pressure.
The statewide hospital network in August said that it would stop providing medically necessary gender affirming health care services – such as prescribing puberty blockers and gender affirming hormones – for patients under age 19. University of Michigan Health and its Michigan Medicine brand argued the decision was made due to an ongoing federal “criminal and civil investigation into gender-affirming care for minors.”
“The [system] is one of multiple institutions across the country that have received a federal subpoena as part of a criminal and civil investigation into gender-affirming care for minors,” said Mary Masson, senior director of public relations at Michigan Medicine, in a statement in response to the rally. “In light of that investigation, and given escalating external threats and risks, we will no longer provide gender affirming hormonal therapies and puberty blocker medications for minors.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In mid-July, the U.S. Department of Justice issued several subpoenas to dozens of health care institutions and doctors across the country “involved in performing transgender medical procedures on children.”. The action by the federal government under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, seeking to limit funding for hospitals and providers offering gender-affirming care to minors, are aimed at what the administration has called “gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth.”
At the rally Thursday, demonstrators were joined by a series of speakers, including community leaders, local politicians, and hospital officials, all focused on the vital importance of these services for many transgender youths. They also touched on the threat posed by the decision and the ripple effect for other Michigan health institutions, bolstered by anonymous testimonies from affected transgender minors.

Washtenaw County Commissioner Yousef Rabhi, a former state representative and the legislative director for the Michigan Nurses Association, said transgender youth in his community deserve necessary and life-sustaining care. Taking that away from them was “a crime.” 
“And at the end of the day, I want to remind us all of the people who make the decisions at this university,” Rabhi said. “They’re elected by all of us. Every two years, you have an opportunity to elect regents. Use that opportunity to hold them accountable.”
Christina Helou, a doctor of physical therapy at University of Michigan Health, told Michigan Advance that restricting access to gender-affirming care was irresponsible. 
“This decision is not based on fact, Helou said. “It is not based on science. It is not based on medical health care evidence. It is strictly based on political pressure from this administration because they’re transphobic.”
Although the university didn’t specify details of the federal subpoena it received, a report from Talking Points Memo showed that the justice department’s  requests received on July 14 was similar to those sent to Philadelphia’s Children’s Hospital, where “individual doctors received a hold order not to destroy documents” and the DOJ was “pursuing a civil and criminal investigation.” 
Doctors are now worried they could face heavy legal fees and potentially lose their medical licenses.
The report, published on Aug. 25, also explains that U of M members were already aware that they would receive new federal requirements a few weeks in advance, and DOJ lawyers were investigating doctors suspected of misusing their authority to prescribe medication, among other potential charges.
Within these federal requests, the New York Times reported that, based on the subpoena sent to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the justice department requested detailed personal information of minor patients, including their names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and parents’ information. Additionally, information about hospital staff, contractors, and affiliates involved in gender-affirming health services, as well as communications between the hospital and providers, was also required.
On Wednesday, Corewell Health released a statement to its patients announcing it, too,would no longer provide gender-affirming hormonal therapies and puberty blockers to minors, arguing a “serious risk of legal and regulatory action.” Corewell is now the latest Michigan health care system to discontinue gender-affirming care for minors under federal pressure.

On Friday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said she was deeply disappointed in Corewell’s decision.
“They have chosen to capitulate to the federal administration’s discriminatory campaign against the trans community, despite Corewell not being a target of any federal action in this realm,” Nessel said in a statement. “Corewell’s shortsighted approach to conform their treatment options and ‘obey in advance’ fails to adequately consider the long-term consequences to the health, safety and well-being of their patients. Michigan law has not changed; gender affirming care remains legal and is approved healthcare by leading healthcare associations.”
Nessel also said the hospitals have chosen to disregard science, best practices, and the recommendations of every major medical society in the nation. She said that created a dangerous precedent that could long-lasting implications on all patients, not just transgender youth.
“We have seen virtue signaling from the federal administration that they intend to detrimentally attack many other areas of public health and medical treatment,” Nessel said. “We must ask ourselves: what other medical practices or care will this Administration target next – reproductive care, vaccines, scientific studies – and will our healthcare institutions quickly succumb to such pressure each and every time?
Parents of transgender children have been left in a state of uncertainty and frustration.
“She had her exit appointment last Thursday, and after that, she became aware that the world is coming to get her. She is devastated,” said Kami Michels, 46, a board member of the Jim Toy Community Center, who told the Advance about hardships her 16-year-old transgender daughter has felt since U of M stopped her gender-affirming care after five years.

Even though Masson specified that U of M is working closely with all impacted patients, and that they “will continuously support the well-being of our patients, their families, and our teams,” for Michels, the reality looks different. 
Although her daughter was able to secure a prescription that will last for years, Michels feels guilty because not everyone has been as fortunate. 
“I have already secured her ongoing care, which not everyone is going to be able to do,” she said.
Michels also criticized the university for abandoning transgender children, claiming that the university’s words of support for the community do not reflect actions in line with federal guidance. 
“Don’t send us another email about how much you care about civil rights,” Michels said. “You say you won’t tolerate totalitarianism; then why are you letting it run your hospital? We are coming for your pocketbook. … Not a single cent of our money will go to you because we know that’s all you really care about. We will not stand by while you abandon the kids who need you most.”

The federal program, which funds nutrition and exercise education for eligible recipients, will end Sept. 30, eliciting worry from officials and providers.

The SNAP-Ed program — which focuses on nutrition education and overall wellness for people on food stamps — will end Sept. 30, cutting off hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual grants that supported programming across all Vermont counties, including recipe demonstrations, meal kits and active-living guides.
The program’s elimination was part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget adjustments that passed on July 4 in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. As the state’s food assistance network finds its way through a new landscape of shortfalls, officials worry more residents will fall through the cracks.
SNAP-Ed is an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which has experienced a number of cuts across the board. Instead of providing funds for individuals to purchase food, SNAP-Ed’s much smaller grants focus on community education and initiatives to improve eligible households’ engagement with 3SquaresVT — Vermont’s name for the larger body of resources under SNAP. 
“Just providing food for people is not the whole answer to food security,” said Suzanne Kelly, who was the SNAP-Ed coordinator at the Vermont Department of Health for a decade until last month. Her former position, and another related role, will soon be discontinued.
“SNAP-Ed is sort of that extra bit of information to really make sure that people can access the food, can use the food, and can enjoy it over time,” Kelly said.
The program is deeply focused on health outcomes, she said, including prevention of chronic conditions and disease, and promoting wellness through nutrition and exercise.
Kelly is concerned about the immediate impact on Vermonters. 
“These are decisions that trickle down to the most vulnerable people in our communities,” she said.
Kelly referenced a SNAP-Ed needs assessment earlier this year that identified certain populations in the state with a disproportionately high need for food assistance, including rural Vermonters and people with disabilities. Outreach programs that meet people where they are geographically will be an especially big loss, Kelly said.
The end of SNAP-Ed has already had tangible effects in recent weeks, causing the imminent shutdown of a food pantry in Holland and contributing to the Vermont Foodbank’s recent staff cuts. Of the seven employees the food bank let go, three were specifically operating SNAP-Ed programs, according to Chris Meehan, the company’s chief impact officer.
Vermont residents received over $147 million in SNAP aid last year. The projected allocation for Vermont’s SNAP-Ed budget in 2026, which the Department of Health received May 30, was less than half a million. Five weeks later, Kelly learned that the program was canceled.
‘We’ll have to be really creative’
Meehan said the SNAP-Ed cuts will effectively end the Vermont Foodbank’s VTFresh program, which has reached every county in the state with initiatives to increase access and understanding around nutrition. The program provided a space for people to exchange knowledge about cooking, recipes and budgeting, and was often particularly useful for families, she said.
While the food bank employees who ran the initiative are no longer with the organization, the program’s existing resources will remain on the Vermont Foodbank website. VTFresh’s continuing presence, Meehan said, will be “more passive than active.”
Meehan is grateful for the infrastructure that VTFresh has left behind — it has been “transformational” for the food assistance network in the state, she said. 
Denise Walton, a Concord resident who is a lead volunteer at Sid’s Pantry in town, said VTFresh recipe materials had been invaluable in allowing her community to make better use of fresh foods. It’s common, she said, for people to ask questions about how to prepare food as they’re taking it.
“I think people want to cook,” said Walton, who herself is on food stamps. “They may not have learned, or been taught, or had the time.”
Walton said she would keep trying to provide resources to help people fully use the food they’re receiving — but that it will be more challenging going forward. 
“We’ll have to be really creative,” Walton said.
Vermont Foodbank’s situation is par for the course statewide at smaller food assistance providers.
The Vermont Garden Network will lose its dedicated nutrition educator, according to executive director T Hanson, one of only five staff at the organization. Come Alive Outside, a nonprofit which used SNAP-Ed funds to reach thousands of school-age kids in Rutland County with tips on how to stay active, has told its staff it may not have sufficient funds to pay everyone in six months, according to Executive Director Arwen Turner. 
Meanwhile, in Burlington, the People’s Farmstand will continue as a purely volunteer effort, according to founding Director Nour El-Naboulsi. There hadn’t been salaried roles, he clarified, but they had previously been able to offer staff — primarily farmers — a stipend for their time. The organization offers free fresh produce (both self-grown and donated) at weekly open events but has also been conducting educational outreach through its Veggie of the Month program. 
El-Naboulsi said the initiative features a combination of staple Vermont crops and “culturally relevant produce — things from Nepal, Somalia, Iraq (and) other places in the Middle East and East Africa.” The organization serves a relatively large proportion of immigrant and refugee populations, he said, and the program is designed to combine familiar food with information about how to prepare local produce.
With the loss of SNAP-Ed funding to the People’s Farmstand and sister organization Village Hydroponics, El-Naboulsi said he has had to reprioritize.
“We kind of lose the capacity to do supplementary education, recipe preparation, outreach,” he said.
‘A great return on investment’
Keith Robinson, a pediatric pulmonologist at UVM Children’s Hospital, emphasized a connection between SNAP-Ed and health outcomes for families. He’s the hospital’s vice chair for Quality Improvement and Population Health and built the provider’s screening platform for food insecurity.
“We are trying to go deeper and further upstream to make sure that we’re solving the root causes of food insecurity in Vermont,” Robinson said.
For him, nutrition education has been a big part of that work — that’s why the end of SNAP-Ed is such a blow, despite the small scale of previous funding.
“It’s gonna make communities potentially less healthy, and it’s also gonna create gaps in the systems that we need to have around families,” he said. “While the dollar value may not be great, the impact of those dollars is extraordinary.”
Robinson referenced a state report on SNAP-Ed last year, calling survey data that indicated diet and exercise changes for participants “a big deal.” Roughly a third of people who received direct nutrition education reported they ate more fruits and vegetables each day, and 20% said they exercised more, according to the report.
“That’s a great return on investment,” Robinson said.
Modifications and cuts to the SNAP program at large have been made in the name of eliminating “waste, fraud, and abuse” — a narrative that Kelly disputed. 
“The strategies that are used (in SNAP-Ed) have shown outcomes — real outcomes,” she said.
A page addressing cost concerns on the USDA website references studies showing that for every dollar spent on SNAP-Ed and similar programs, 10 times that can be saved in future health care costs. The total nationwide cost of the program would have been $550 million in the 2026 fiscal year.
“It’s probably not the best idea to be cutting programs that are going to eventually help reduce costs way further down the line,” Kelly said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to requests for comment.
A document briefly detailing SNAP overhaul from the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture called SNAP-Ed a program that has wrought “no meaningful change” for its target population. The committee cited a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office that appears to primarily conclude that the effectiveness of the program is difficult to properly evaluate due to uneven standards of reporting from state agencies and a lack of coordination at the federal level. 
“When federal benefits get cut like this, we need to think about how to bolster connections in our community, and think differently about how to fill those gaps,” Robinson said. 
Jeanne Montross, executive director of Helping Overcome Poverty’s Effects, or HOPE, in Middlebury, said her organization has been seeing the effects of staff and program cuts elsewhere in the state’s assistance networks. Montross’ nonprofit is primarily funded by private contributions.
“It always ends up flowing down to HOPE,” she said of increased need in her local community.
Anore Horton, executive director at Hunger Free Vermont, said the state’s food assistance network “cannot in any way mitigate the loss of all of these different sources of funding.”
Any solution to a problem of this scale must be “collective,” Horton said, but must also involve significant new assistance from the state government. But in a situation this urgent, Horton said it wouldn’t necessarily make sense for the state to replace nutrition education funding.
Walton said Sid’s Pantry has also been increasingly relying on community support and donations.
“We’re very fortunate to have a little buffering like that,” she said, “especially for an aging community that needs healthy food and needs access to things out in the rural areas.”

The decision issued earlier this month comes in a lawsuit filed more than four years ago challenging delays in the state’s court system associated with obtaining civil complaints.

A federal judge has granted an injunction against the Vermont judiciary in a legal action brought by news outlets aimed at curbing delays when seeking newly filed civil lawsuits.
The ruling issued this month by Judge Christina Reiss is the latest turn in the lawsuit brought by news outlets and other First Amendment advocates more than four years ago.
The judge added in the ruling that she would now consider whether to grant attorneys fees to cover the expenses of the lawyers who argued the case on behalf of the organizations, a figure that is expected to total more than $1 million.

Reiss, in the four-page order, wrote that the process the judiciary had used to screen lawsuits for potential confidential materials before making them publicly available delayed the release of the records and violated the First Amendment rights of the news outlets. 
According to the legal action, the timely access to the filings allows for the public to understand what’s happening in the court system, provides for accountability and informs people about matters of public concern.
“Plaintiffs have a presumptive right First Amendment right of access to newly filed complaints, which attaches upon the court’s receipt of such complaints,” Reiss wrote in the ruling.
Courthouse News Service, a Pasadena, California-based company, was joined by news outlets across Vermont in its lawsuit filed in May 2021 in federal court in Burlington. 
Courthouse News Service, according to its website, “covers news, both national and international, that moves society and its many elements in one direction or another.”
Jonathan G. Fetterly, a California attorney who argued the case on behalf of parties bringing the action, said in a statement this week that Reiss’ ruling was a “great victory for public access” following years of “hard fought litigation.” 
The parties joining in the legal action were the Vermont Press Association and the New England First Amendment Coalition, as well as the parent entities of VTDigger.org, Seven Days, the Burlington Free Press and WCAX-TV. 
Other participants signing onto the case were the Vermont Community Newspaper Group, which operates weekly newspapers in several communities including Stowe, Morristown, Shelburne, South Burlington and Charlotte, and the parent company of the Rutland Herald/Barre-Montpelier Times Argus.
“This is another important victory for the public when it comes to transparency at the courts all across Vermont,” Mike Donoghue, executive director of the Vermont Press Association, said Friday of the ruling.
Teri Corsones, Vermont’s state court administrator, said in a text message Friday, “The Judiciary certainly values the public’s right to access to court filings, while also taking important steps to protect sensitive information.”
Corsones referred specific questions related to the ruling to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which represented the judiciary in the lawsuit. In turn, the Attorney General’s Office, later Friday, referred specific questions about the ruling to judiciary officials. Leda Moloff, general counsel for the Vermont judiciary, wrote in a text late Friday that judiciary officials had no further comment.
The lawsuit has been working its way through the court system for years, including a stop at the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals before landing back in federal district court in Vermont earlier this year. 
Courthouse News Service, in a filing more than two years ago, stated that the attorneys’ fees and costs associated with bringing the action already totaled more than $1 million. 
Reiss, the judge, asked the parties to submit a briefing schedule related to attorneys’ fees by later this month regarding the issue.

(Caspar Benson / Getty Images)A 19-year-old New Mexico man is facing federal charges after admitting to the FBI that he posted violent threats online in the wake of the recent shooting death of Charlie Kirk, including a threat toward an Ohio City Councilor, federal prosecutors announced Friday afternoon.
Jace Allen, of Jamestown, N.M., began making threatening posts on X, shortly after Kirk’s assassination at an event at Utah Valley in Orem, Utah on Sept. 10. Some of the exchanges mentioned Kirk’s death, including one from Allen, in which he said: “I will harm anyone who has something bad to say about Charlie.”
In more than a dozen posts, Allen said he was going to “commit mass murder” targeting Black, Jewish and liberal people, as well as other individual people on line he said he was “coming for,” according to the criminal complaint. Many of the posts are still online. The account has 0 followers.
Bomb threats to New Mexico lawmakers sent via email, police say

An FBI agent in Toledo, Ohio, received a tip about the posts Thursday, including one against an Ohio City Council member that said, “You’re going to be one of the first to die. I’ll be seeing you soon,” according to the criminal complaint.
The Ohio FBI agent tracked the account to a home in Jamestown and notified an FBI agent in Gallup, according to the complaint. Around 6 p.m. yesterday, the agent interviewed Allen at his home, where Allen said he identifies as a Neo-Nazi, according to the complaint. 
“Allen believes a civil war is inevitable in the United States and wants to help spark the civil war by terrorizing people online,” FBI agent Michael Dalpini wrote in the complaint filed Friday.
Allen allegedly told the agent that, while he does not own a gun, he wanted to buy a rifle with a scope that is the same make, model and style of the kind police say was used to assassinate Kirk, according to the complaint. 
However, when Allen gave the FBI agent consent to search his phone, police found two videos from mid-August of him shooting a rifle and handgun at an unknown location, according to the complaint.

The awards honor excellence in digital journalism around the world.


CalMatters was named the best medium-sized newsroom in the 2025 Online Journalism Awards. CalMatters’ new Director of Product Andrew Losowsky won the association’s Impact Award. The honors were announced Friday at the Online News Association awards ceremony in New Orleans.
In addition, one of CalMatters’ board members, Robert Hernandez, was honored with the Rich Jaroslovsky Founder’s Award.
First Place, General Excellence
CalMatters won first place for general excellence among medium-sized newsrooms. 
Judges said they “chose to honor the innovative Digital Democracy project and the comprehensive multi-platform Voter Guide, recognizing a winner that fully meets the criteria for general excellence. These useful, hands-on tools and their stories that led to real-world impact stood out as fulfilling their mission to demystify California government.”
Neil Chase, CEO, accepted the award for CalMatters and said, “It is deeply meaningful to be cited for this work by people who know better than anybody else what we do and why it matters. I’m accepting this on behalf of the 80 people at CalMatters and all the other folks who work with us: the partners we have around California, around the country — a number of whom are in this room — the broadcasters and news organizations in California who help us get this news out to people.”
Here are some highlights of CalMatters’ work over the past year:

Our stories and tools made government actions and decisions relatable, held leaders accountable and gave Californians vital information to engage with their government – resulting in impact felt across the state. In journalism, impact can take seconds or it can take years. When it comes to big issues we bring persistent, accountability coverage, and this year, we’ve seen that result in widespread impact: a California state audit (triggered by a 2023 CalMatters investigation) found that a law meant to reveal who funds state legislators’ sponsored travel is falling short, state legislators advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight (directly citing an ongoing CalMatters investigation on conditions inside homeless shelters), and California’s political watchdog fined a former lawmaker $106,000 for campaign finance violations (after a 2020 CalMatters story). This is only a fraction of the impact we’ve had.
Our Voter Guide has been a powerhouse resource that has helped Californians figure out how they want to vote. In 2024, we reached our widest audience thus far, by meeting voters where they were. We created TikTok videos and filters, launched an interactive ballot preview tool, partnered with local publications to show readers articles relevant to their ballot, created magazine-style quizzes that hundreds of Californians used at 40+ in-person events, printed a Voter Guide zine, added Chinese and Korean translations in addition to Spanish, and a version for English learners. One in five California voters used our guide.
Our Digital Democracy platform, launched in 2024, shows video and transcripts from every hearing, logs every vote, provides data on lobbyists and an easy way to track bills. We’ve also trained journalists in 20+ newsrooms on how to use our AI-generated tipsheets. With the help of our tipsheets, CBS News partnered with us to reveal that California’s one-party supermajority legislature systematically avoids transparency and accountability by killing controversial legislation without voting on the record. Digital Democracy has been awarded an Emmy and won the Poynter Institute’s Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation.

Congratulations to finalists ProPublica, Mother Jones/Center for Investigative Reporting and The Texas Tribune.
CalMatters was a finalist in the same category of general excellence among medium-sized newsrooms last year, won by ProPublica. The Markup, now part of CalMatters, won the award last year among small-sized newsrooms.
Finalist, Social Media Engagement
CalMatters was a finalist for excellence in social media engagement among medium-sized newsrooms.
Last year, CalMatters used TikTok to share nonpartisan Voter Guide information and to meet younger voters where they are:

Made-for-Gen Z TikToks: We experimented a lot, failing multiple times before we found our first viral success when we started breaking down California propositions using a call center format. We created skits where a reporter played both a confused voter and a call center prop expert. TikTokers started paying attention, and we kept going, making and trying out organic ways to reach young voters on TikTok.
Launching our own TikTok filter: Like in previous elections, we created online interactive quizzes that helped California voters figure out where they stood on each of the statewide propositions. But in 2024, after being inspired by lighthearted beauty industry TikTok filters that asked viewers to vote for makeup by tilting their heads, we created a series of CalMatters TikTok filters asking you if you thought the rent was too damn high — and other similar questions — that could help TikTokers decide how they’d vote on the state’s ballot propositions this year. (Our demo.) Our quiz filters were used over 20,000 times in the two weeks before the election.
Working with California influencers: For the first time ever, CalMatters worked with influencers to help make sure our voter guide reached young voters on TikTok. We selected six influencers based on common criteria — they were in California, they normally posted lifestyle videos, and they thought of young adults as one of their main audiences. We also asked them to clearly disclose that CalMatters was sponsoring their post, to create videos in their own voice, and to tell their audience about our voter guide.

Congratulations to The Marshall Project, who won, and our fellow finalists, National Geographic and The Baltimore Banner. This is CalMatters’ first honor in the excellence in social media category.
Impact Award
CalMatters’ new Director of Product Andrew Losowsky won this year’s ONA Impact Award. The honor is for “a trailblazing individual whose work in digital journalism and dedication to innovation exhibits a substantial impact on the industry, regardless of their tenure in journalism.”
Rodney Gibbs, an ONA board member, presented the award and said, “Andrew’s work on developing The Coral Project … brought the comment section into the modern era, and it created a system that dozens of sites still use today. …[Now] in his new role at CalMatters, he’s bringing that organization’s award-winning journalism to a broader audience, and through development of tools and processes, he is helping to give Californians more agency and more access to what’s going on inside their state.”
Accepting the award, Losowsky said, “True impact occurs when journalism improves the lives of the communities it serves. … A real community is a lot more than an audience. Communities are groups of people who engage, interact and support each other. Communities are how we build trust, how we create common knowledge, how we share our humanity, how we feel less alone.”
He continued, discussing recent attacks on independent journalism, “For our industry, for this nation, for every single one of us in this room and out there, if and when [targeted attacks on individuals and journalists] come, I look forward to us standing strong, in community, together.”
Before joining CalMatters, Losowsky was the founding head of Coral, a community platform used by more than 500 major news websites in 28 countries. He ran Coral for ten years, managing its acquisition by Vox Media, and overseeing community strategy across the organization.
Losowsky is the co-creator of Perspectives, a project that helps journalists find inspiration from a broader range of work and practice, and generates connections with experts in other industries. He is also an advisor to Documented, and a founding member of the News Product Alliance.
Jaroslovsky Founder’s Award
The award, bestowed on CalMatters’ board member Robert Hernandez, is for someone who “has significantly advanced or made lasting contributions to the field of digital journalism through their work in the industry, and who exhibits extraordinary commitment to the mission, value and vision of ONA.”
Hernandez is a professor of professional practice at USC Annenberg who focuses on exploring and developing the intersection of technology and journalism. His work emphasizes empowering people through informative reporting and storytelling, community engagement, growing content distribution models, and supporting journalism financially.
Accepting the award, Hernandez said, “Despite my chaos muppet energy, they gave me this award. I am a misfit that often feels out of place, but I’ve been a blessed misfit where people have looked out for me. They welcomed me to places and that really shaped me.”
Hernandez reflected on how he has learned over his career that whenever he’s in the room where decisions are happening, he has the daunting responsibility to have the courage to speak up, and that journalists have the responsibility to speak up.
“You have to speak up and challenge each other with love and respect,” Hernandez said. “Use your voice, no matter how shaky it may sound.”
Sisi Wei, chief impact officer of CalMatters and The Markup, shared that she has known Hernandez since  she was a journalism student trying to narrow down her interests.
“He was so supportive of journalism students everywhere, not simply those who had the pleasure of taking his classes,” Wei said. “He wanted everyone to experiment, to get opportunities, to push themselves, and to push the industry. And through his own work, he did just that. And he did it in a way that included and elevated his students.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225-ONA-WINNER-GH-CM.png?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 18:57:34.980891

Nearly 60% of Vermont faces severe drought. Officials say reporting drought impacts help collect data and shape a response.

As drought conditions worsen in Vermont, state officials are asking residents to report the impacts.
On Thursday, the Agency of Natural Resources encouraged Vermonters to communicate information on dry wells and water supplies, farm losses, crop damage, low water levels in rivers, lakes and recreational areas, and other issues related to water quality or availability.
These reports help the state assess the severity of the drought, identify where and what type of assistance is needed, and make plans to address drought impacts.

The U.S. Drought Monitor shows that almost 60% of Vermont is in severe drought conditions, up from 34% last week. When people report drought impacts to state officials, the data also informs the drought severity to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which can trigger action from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Internal Revenue Service to support Vermonters who may be significantly affected.
“There are actually six types of droughts, and we’re in all of them right now,” said state climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux, a geography professor at the University of Vermont and chair of the Vermont Drought Task Force.
“The one that is particularly concerning right now is the hydrological drought, which is when we look at how dry the lakes, ponds, streams, and wells and groundwater supplies are because that’s the one that had been at these record low levels even going back to last fall,” she said. The state is now experiencing both short- and long-term hydrological drought, she added.
According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, this past August has been the driest on record in Vermont since 1895.
Occasional rains or thunderstorms won’t be sufficient to reverse the current conditions, as some areas of Vermont have seen nearly 8 inches less rain than usual in the past four months, and the soil moisture level is 60% to 80% below average, Thursday’s press release by the Agency of Natural Resources states.
The drought task force, composed of state and federal representatives, continues to meet regularly to monitor the situation and provide new recommendations.
People can consult the agency’s drought resources for a list of contacts to report drought conditions. The task force also recommends reducing water consumption at home.
“Any sort of drought-related impact, I think it’s important for us to hear about so that we can start deploying the resources that need to be deployed as a response,” Dupigny-Giroux said.

Defense […],"Pictured is a Swadley's Bar-B-Q restaurant in Midwest City on Feb. 8, 2024. (Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A restaurant owner charged with defrauding the state is accusing Oklahoma’s attorney general of using a pending criminal case to bolster his gubernatorial bid.
Brent Swadley is seeking to have Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office removed from the case and to have a judge prohibit them from publicly speaking about it.
Defense attorneys argue Drummond has used his position to publicly declare Swadley guilty, predict his imprisonment and paint him as “a symbol of government corruption,” according to court filings.
But in court documents, Drummond argues the accusations and request for gag order amount to an unpermitted stall tactic to delay criminal proceedings. He denies wrongdoing.
In February 2024, the state’s multicounty grand jury indicted Ronald Brent Swadley, Curtis Ray Breuklander and Timothy Raymond Hooper with one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state.
The charges stemmed from a controversial contract the state had with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen to operate restaurants in some state parks. Prosecutors allege the state was provided with false invoices, and a restaurant supplier was directed to fabricate invoices with inflated amounts.
Swadley is the company’s owner. Hooper served as the company’s chief operating officer and Breuklander is a former vice president. 
A spokesperson for Swadley’s said Hooper and Breuklander were no longer with the company.
The three men have denied wrongdoing. 
When reached for comment Friday, Drummond’s office pointed to court briefs filed in response. Drummond’s statements are allowable and a response to a media campaign by Swadley, the filing said. Swadley fails to present evidence the statements will prejudice the fact finding process, the response said.
In a motion, Drummond said Swadley is using an amended motion to disqualify “as a procedural weapon to delay these proceedings.” 
He wrote the court should deny both the gag order and removal requests because they’re attempts to delay the trial, which had been scheduled for November.
A judge pushed back the trial date over the state’s “strenuous objection.” It had not been rescheduled as of Friday.
Swadley’s attorney could not immediately comment on Drummond’s allegation about delaying the trial, a spokesperson said.
The state has also sued Swadley in civil court. Swadley has countersued.
Swadley’s filing accuses Drummond of violating the Rules of Professional Conduct for attorneys.
Drummond’s remarks are also interfering with Swadley’s business relationships, the brief said.
“These statements, which were delivered at public events, on the campaign trail, in press releases, on social media and quoted in media articles, go far beyond permissible public information and strike at the heart of Swadley’s” right to a fair trial, the motion said.
Swadley says Drummond told a banker’s group in March that people who are wealthy and well connected in Oklahoma can break the law. He also said that Brent Swadley is going to go to prison for about eight years, according to filings.
A few weeks later, a bank to which Swadley had applied for a loan terminated his application, according to the filing.
In April, Drummond said Swadley “washed invoices” and took $6 million from the state, according to the motion.

‘We take this seriously’: ISDA director on out-of-state boat traffic, Idaho quagga mussels

After detecting the invasive species first in 2023 and again in 2024, Idaho officials treated the river with a chemical to kill the mussels.
But officials with the Idaho State Department of Agriculture say the amount of the river in which quagga mussel larvae were detected this year, about 3.5 river miles, is 51% lower than last year’s range, which was 7.2 river miles. Officials say that is progress, and shows the agency’s treatment strategy is effective.
“Quagga mussels pose a serious threat to Idaho’s water infrastructure, ecosystems and economy,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt said in a statement. “Full eradication remains the goal, but even reaching a level of containment is uncommon in other U.S. systems. (The agency’s) treatments are critical to prevent widespread impacts to agriculture, power generation and Idaho’s aquatic environments.”   
The announcement came two years after Idaho officials first found the invasive mussel species in the Snake River near Twin Falls in September 2023. 
This year’s detections are located near Shoshone Falls, according to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.

 After copper-based chemical treatment in Snake River, Idaho officials planning ‘targeted treatment plan’ for this year

In response to detections in 2023 and 2024, officials and contractors applied a copper-based chemical called Natrix to the river, which is meant to kill the mussels but also kills fish. Officials also boosted other prevention and monitoring efforts, including water craft inspection sites and public education to clean water crafts.
The Idaho State Department of Agriculture is preparing a “targeted treatment plan” for this year, officials announced in a news release. 
The treatment will likely involve the copper-based chemical Natrix, “as it has been proven to be effective,” agency spokesperson Sydney Kennedy told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
The agency spent $1.5 million on Natrix in 2023 and $2.1 million in 2024, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
In a joint statement, officials from the city of Twin Falls and the counties of Twin Falls and Jerome said their communities “are proud to stand alongside the Idaho State Department of Agriculture in this critical fight against quagga mussels.”
Thanks to the agency’s “swift action and expertise, the infestation has been contained to a small stretch of the Snake River, and we are encouraged by this progress. Protecting our waterways from quagga mussels is essential to our farms, residents and the entire Magic Valley community, and this partnership is key to safeguarding the future of our region,” read the statement by Twin Falls Mayor Ruth Pierce, Jerome County Commission Chairman Ben Crouch and Twin Falls County Commission Chairman Don Hall.
The State Department of Agriculture reports it has inspected roughly 159,000 water craft this year. 
In the area of the Snake River that is infested, officials say the agency conducted more than 450 samples out of more than 4,500 across the state.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A Rhode Island federal judge Friday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from awarding grants to applicants responding by a one-week deadline to a drastically revised notice for funding to build housing for people experiencing chronic homelessness.
HUD’s new notice issued Sept. 5 superseded a funding notice issued in May and served as yet another example of chaos unleashed by the Trump administration on the courts, U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy said at the Zoom hearing. The deadline for applications was 3 p.m. Friday, a half hour before the hearing began.
“It’s unfortunate that we are here on these things that are done so last minute by these agencies, but here we are,” McElroy told attorneys representing the plaintiffs in a case filed Thursday by attorneys for National Alliance to End Homelessness and Providence based Women’s Development Corporation (WDC).
Lawsuit over federal housing grants filed in Providence federal court

The plaintiffs are suing HUD and HUD Secretary Scott Turner over new eligibility criteria for applications for $75 million in Continuum of Care Build grants. They claim the new rules are unconstitutional and unlawful because applicants are prohibited from being so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” for immigrants, providing “harm reduction” services for drug users and having inclusive policies for transgender people. The revised grant funding notice indicated that grants would be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.
The case, National Alliance to End Homelessness v. Turner, et al., asks the court to block HUD’s unlawful funding restrictions and restore fair access to federal housing funds for providers nationwide. The lawsuit claims projects in 36 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are now ineligible for Continuum of Care Build grants under the Trump administration’s criteria.
Kristin Bateman, senior counsel with Democracy Forward, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, argued that the abrupt reissue of the funding notice violated the HUD Reform Act, which requires new funding opportunities to be issued with 30 days notice.
“Here there was a seven-day turnaround with no justification,” Bateman said.
Joshua Schopf, a trial attorney for the Department of Justice’s civil division, argued that the HUD secretary had 30 days to publish his reasons for waiving the standard notice with a federal register.
“This happened Sept. 5… he has until Oct. 6 to publish his reasons,” he said. “We haven’t violated procedure because it’s still ongoing.”
Bateman also took aim at the revised eligibility criteria that prohibit applicants from having policies supporting transgender people, which she said conflicts with existing federal law barring discrimination against non-cisgendered people.
“There’s no way someone could comply with those federal laws and this eligibility criteria treating sex as a binary thing,” she said.
“We’re not going to defend that particular condition,” Schopf told McElroy.
WDC had been informed in August by the office of U.S. Sen. Jack Reed that it would receive a $7 million Continuum of Care Build grant for a project to build 14 units for individuals escaping domestic violence in five new buildings in Providence’s West End. It had applied for the funding in May. But the nonprofit developer said it would be ineligible to apply for the new notice issued Sept. 5 since it has no control over the city or state’s stance on immigration and other policies nor could it reapply with only a one-week turnaround.
“The new conditions, if they’re precedent, you could argue that nobody in Rhode Island would be eligible if this applies to other grants,” WDC Executive Director Frank Shea told Rhode Island Current Friday afternoon.
Shea said he was pleased the court issued the restraining order and that the grant fund won’t go elsewhere for the time being. 
“That was the fear, it would be hard to undo,” he said.
During the hearing, McElroy said she was convinced that HUD’s new grant eligibility criteria caused irreparable harm.
“The irreparable harm is that these funds would be lost forever by anybody that intends to apply,” McElroy said.
“The court’s decision provides significant relief for communities in vulnerable circumstances and for the principle that federal housing funds exist to serve people in need, not to advance partisan goals,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, in a statement issued Friday just as the 54-minute hearing concluded. “The administration cannot unlawfully weaponize essential housing resources. We are proud to fight alongside our clients and partners as the case continues.”
The Trump administration now has 14 days to ask for a preliminary injunction. McElroy also tasked the DOJ with a briefing schedule and suggested hearings could be held in person in Providence instead of virtually if Shopf would like.
“Rhode Island’s lovely in the fall, not so much in February when it rains constantly,” she said.

The threats, which targeted the home and office of Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and the home of Majority Floor Leader Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe), also prompted one school evacuation and a lockdown at City Hall. No explosives were found at any of the three locations, according to Santa Fe and state police departments. 
The bomb threats followed Wednesday’s fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, and came amid similar threats across the country, including at numerous Historically Black Colleges and University campuses, leading to lockdowns and canceled classes. 
One of the emails was sent to the Santa Fe Mayor’s office, and is under investigation by Santa Fe Police. 
Mayor Alan Webber told Source NM in a phone call that he could not provide a copy of the threat emailed to his office Thursday, but said the email’s tone was “very matter of fact,” and contained no expletives.  
“In broad strokes, the email was describing what the sender was alleged to have put into the mailbox, and that it resembled a pipe bomb, how it had been constructed and essentially what the timetable was for doing harm,” Webber said. 
He told Source NM this kind of email was not common. 
“This is a fairly rare occurrence for people to make a threat like that in the first place, thankfully, or would think that the way to get it to the public or to the intended target is by sending an email to the mayor’s office,” he said. 
Webber said the day was already emotional, noting the anniversary of 9/11 and Kirk’s death – and said that he thought the timing of the threat was related to one or either of those events. 
“We’re all in this together and disagreeing is fine, but violence is never the solution,” he said. 
Webber said Santa Fe Police decided not to issue emergency alerts about the threats to prevent further threats to evacuated children, and noted that the affected streets were not “busy thoroughfares.” 
Santa Fe Police Deputy Chief Ben Valdez told Source NM the department acted out of caution, and to prevent the locations of school evacuations and pick-ups.   
“We don’t know if it is a legitimate threat or if it is a threat that is trying to solicit a response where now they expose students or faculty to danger,” he said. 
New Mexico State Police declined to make anyone available for an interview, but said in an email that the threats were emailed, and directed only at the specific lawmakers. Source NM has pending public records requests for the emails and police reports with both agencies.
State Police alerted Santa Fe police to the emailed threats, and was also in contact with the Legislative Council Service Director Shawna Casebier. 
Casebier, who is also the chief staff for the interim Capitol Security Subcommittee, told Source NM in a phone call that members met in closed session in June, Casebier said — following the assasination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband — and may meet again before the 2026 January session. 
“Regardless of what happens in other states or in the national landscape, capital security, security of legislators, staff, public, in the building is of the highest priority and concern,” Casebier said. “We are constantly evaluating to ensure that the security protocols and infrastructure are appropriate to address concerns.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WirthReena-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-09-12 17:58:03.387932

Joe Lombardo said at a Friday press conference.
The governor said the “bad actor” involved is believed to have received “information through our internal system, not public based or distinct personal information. It’s information on data that is endemic to state processes or state inventory or state databases.”
He added, “Right now, the breadth of that has been identified.”
Lombardo said he could not provide specific details, echoing past press conferences where he has emphasized that the investigation is ongoing and that state and federal officials must balance transparency with security.
When asked about the motive of the attack, the governor responded, “Well, obviously it’s a ransom, right? To achieve monetary gain as a goal.”
Lombardo did not provide any details of the ransom or whether it has been paid.
Lombardo said 90% of state public-facing websites are back online.
 
Information on the current status of various state services can be found at oem.nv.gov/recovery.


Of those that remain down, the state is prioritizing “public safety and consistent impact,” he added. Among services still down: background checks needed for certain people attempting to buy firearms, the state’s victim notification system, and the sex offender registry lookup.
“While we are not yet at the finish line, we are moving there faster than expected,” added Lombardo.
Lombardo said the state received 150 million hits to its firewall in the 72 hours after his first press conference — 300% more than it typically receives.
He also said phishing attempts spiked after recent news reports about the state forcing all state employees to reset security credentials and passwords.
Lombardo highlighted the incidents while making a point about the need to withhold information about the technical details and nature of the cyber attack.
The governor expressed support for a legislative cybersecurity working group announced by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager earlier this week.
“I would support any endeavor by the Legislature to identify some sort of solution to help us in this endeavor,” he said, adding that it could involve hardware, software or monetary solutions. “In my opinion, [it] has risen to an emergency, and I think it’s necessary that we address it sooner than later.”
Details on that working group are forthcoming, according to a press release from the Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus.

U.S. Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, and his wife stand behind Rollins. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)YUKON — With no active cases of New World screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working to prevent its spread from Central America, a Trump administration official said Friday. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins outlined the Department of Agriculture’s plan to prevent the spread of screwworm to the United States, including a partnership with the government of Mexico, during a stop at Express Ranches in Oklahoma. 
New World screwworm is a fly that lays eggs in the wounds of living animals and its larvae burrow and feed on healthy flesh, causing illness or death. The insect usually infects livestock and is typically found in South and Central America, but one case was detected in a human this summer who had returned from travel to El Salvador. 
“President Trump’s America First agenda means our (agricultural) community deserves unwavering support in the face of critical threats like this one,” she said. “As the situation evolves, we will continue our efforts to keep vulnerable livestock ranchers and the rest of America safe. The U.S. has defeated the New World screwworm before, and we will do it again.”
Earlier this sumer there was a confirmed case of screwworms in Mexico about 370 miles from the U.S. border, south of Texas. The USDA halted live cattle crossing at the border and got “really serious” about preventing the spread, Rollins said. 
No cases of screwworm have been detected in livestock in the United States. 
“So again, we’ve got plan A, plan B, plan C, plan D, but we are not messing around with any of them,” Rollins said. “We are getting fully prepared at every single level for whatever comes.”
The USDA’s plan to prevent the spread of screwworm includes investments of up to $100 million for innovations to find new ways to combat the insect and $750 million to create a facility in south Texas to sterilize flies and combat the spread. 
Releasing sterile flies was a technique used to eradicate the pest in the 1960s to disrupt the reproduction of screwworms and is being used again today. The hope is that those sterile flies will then mate with wild ones, producing infertile eggs, experts said. 
Another $21 million is being invested to renovate an existing fruit fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, to produce more sterile flies.

Rollins estimated the facility in Mexico will be functioning again in the coming months, but the Texas facility will take 12 to 18 months to produce. Combined, these facilities will produce up to 400 million additional sterile flies per week. 
Agents from the USDA will also monitor the U.S.-Mexico border as “Tick Riders” along with dogs to detect infested livestock, Rollins said. 
In order to prevent screwworm from crossing the southern border, the U.S. partnered with Mexico. Mexico has waived duties on eradication equipment being sent across the border and allowed for the U.S. to complete aerial drops of sterile flies, Rollins said. 
“I’ve only been on the job about seven or eight months, but many have said that our partnership with Mexico right now is as strong and as transparent as it has been in decades,” she said. 
The USDA will also inspect animals and carcasses for signs of New World screwworm infection to protect the country’s food supply. 
Screwworm was more widespread in the United States in the 1960s, but it was later eradicated. 
U.S. Representative Frank Lucas, R-Oklahoma, said it’s a “critical battle” to prevent screwworms from reaching the United States again. 
“The battle on new world screwworms [is] the chief threat we face in the livestock industry,” he said. “I was too young to remember it firsthand, but I listened to my late father and grandfather talk about going out every day all summer long with a bottle of stuff to paint newborns’ navels and treat every wound on an animal. I’ve listened to my old retired game warden point out to me that before these were eradicated in the 60s, we had dramatically fewer deer and other wildlife because they attack all animals.”

(Photo for Kentucky Lantern by Sarah Ladd)A Kentucky judge has declined to issue a preliminary injunction in a case challenging a new state law that blocks the use of public funds for inmates’ elective medical treatments and takes 67 transgender inmates off hormone therapy. 
U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove said in his Friday ruling that the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which is representing an incarcerated person, “has not shown at this preliminary stage a constitutional violation that warrants enjoining the enforcement.” 
Court documents say the ACLU’s client, Maddilyn Marcum, was “diagnosed with gender dysphoria and placed on HRT five years prior” to incarceration. HRT refers to hormone replacement therapy. The ruling says that the client was ineligible to receive HRT post sentencing due to not being on it when entering Department of Corrections custody.  
“This decision is disappointing, but we will continue to litigate our case on behalf of Ms. Marcum and all transgender people who are incarcerated in Kentucky.” Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement. “We will continue to demonstrate to the court how this cruel policy violates our clients’ right to receive medically necessary healthcare.”
Ban on public funds  for KY prisoners’ transgender care becomes law without Beshear’s signature

The ACLU is challenging Senate Bill 2 from the 2025 legislative session, saying it violates the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits the use of cruel and unusual punishment. 
The law, a high priority in the Republican-controlled legislature, says public dollars cannot be used to fund a “cosmetic service or elective procedure” for Kentucky inmates. It also says if a health care provider documents that ending a treatment would harm an inmate, use of the drug or hormone may be “systematically reduced and eliminated.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, let it become law without his signature. 
The case will continue, an ACLU spokeswoman said. This ruling means the law will be in effect as the case makes its way through the courts.

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers, economists and community leaders met in Augusta on Friday to begin a new approach to address Maine’s property tax burden. 
While there is bipartisan agreement that the burden is too high, the Legislature held off on any substantial reform this past session to first convene a task force to holistically study the issue.
The initial meeting of what will ultimately be a two-year study of the issue largely consisted of an overview of the current property tax structure and assistance programs. However, discussions already indicated a range of ideas, such as reevaluating current non-taxable properties and exemptions as well as looking to other states for possible answers. 
For example, Rhode Island added a tax on non-owner-occupied properties assessed at $1 million or more, what is being referred to by some as the “Taylor Swift tax” because the singer has a vacation home on Watch Hill, said Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and a nonvoting member of the task force.
Republican Sen. Bruce Bickford of Androscoggin pointed to the Florida Constitution authorizing its Legislature to allow counties and municipalities to grant exemptions to certain people who are 65 years old or over. 
The ultimate goal of the Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force — which has 13 voting and two nonvoting members — is to determine the source of the problems with the current system of property taxation, identify who is most negatively affected by the current system and how those people are impacted.
An interim report detailing preliminary findings and recommendations is due to the Legislature’s Taxation Committee by Jan. 15. A final report, including suggested legislation, is due by Dec. 15, 2026. The group has to meet at least four times but no more than eight, though that doesn’t include subcommittee meetings. The next meeting has yet to be determined. 
Legislators suggest task force tackle challenge of property tax reform

What’s been tried?
The state has made several changes to try to address the property tax burden over the years. 
The state budget has taken on a lot of that responsibility, Allen said, pointing to Maine only recently meeting its requirement to fund 55% of K-12 municipal costs, which have been rising. 
The state has also added new assistance programs, though some not for long. 
In 2024, lawmakers expanded eligibility to the Property Tax Fairness Credit — which provides refunds for property taxes or rent paid. The cost of this credit to the state has gone from $15 million in 2018 to a projected $100 million in this fiscal year, according to Allen. 
That expansion, as well as the creation of a Property Tax Deferral Program, in 2024 was meant to soften the blow from the short-lived Property Tax Stabilization Program that allowed older Mainers to freeze their property taxes. 
The Legislature repealed that program after just one year in effect, following skyrocketing cost projections, concern about wealthy property owners taking advantage due to a lack of income restrictions and the administrative burden it left on municipalities.
Lawmakers considered a host of changes earlier this year, including several Republican proposals to reinstate the stabilization program, which were ultimately rejected. Proposals to collect extra taxes on short-term rentals also failed. 
Other bills are being carried over into the next session, which begins in January. Some of those plans include expanding the Property Tax Fairness Credit, expanding property tax assistance for veterans and their survivors and increasing the state’s tax exemption for homeowners. 
Many of these suggestions would tweak existing programs, such as the Homestead Property Tax Exemption, which provides a reduction for property tax purposes of up to $25,000 from the value of a home for those eligible. 
“Are those programs achieving the aims that they originally set out to?” asked task force member Vinnie Caliendo, president of the wholesaler Native Maine Produce and Specialty Foods. “Are any of them being either abused and not benefiting the right parties in the way that was the original intention or, conversely, are they and could they be enhanced so they do so better?”
Bipartisan efforts to expand property tax exemptions face pushback from Mills administration

Current factors
Property taxes have long been a concern in Northeast states, which tend to rely more significantly on them for revenue to fund public institutions such as schools. But Allen said during the Friday meeting that the burden of such taxes has become more of an issue across the country since the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s not just that the value is going up,” Allen said. “It’s that the value on residential is increasing [while] commercial property values were declining, so more of the burden of the taxes is being pushed onto residential properties.” 
Maine was hit harder than some other states because a lot of people moved into the state during the pandemic, he added.  
Allen also provided context to recent reports that have ranked Maine as a state with the highest property tax burden. 
If all property taxes in the state are divided by the population, Maine lands around the tail end of the top ten. If all property taxes are divided by personal income, that rank moves up. Allen says the latter is problematic because Maine residents don’t pay all property taxes. That calculation doesn’t factor in wealthy people who have second homes in the state. 
Historically Maine has topped census lists of the percentage of housing units vacant because they are used as second homes, with northern New England neighbors closely following. 
“We’re an outlier, and again, if you’re just going to take those total properties and divide them by our personal income — this is one reason why we’re going to be number one,” Allen said. “We’re Vacationland.” 
But Allen clarified, that doesn’t mean Maine doesn’t have high property taxes. 
Right now, possible increases in valuations are worrying many across the state.  
“The thing that seems to get people that I’ve talked to in my community wound up is the change in value,” said task force member Robert Nutting, the Republican representative of Oakland. 
Many towns are now getting caught back up with delayed revaluations that reflect post-pandemic jumps in residential property value. 
Increased assessments don’t necessarily mean higher property taxes, rather they determine the proportion each property owner pays of a town’s taxes. Typically this means while some residents will see higher taxes, others will see them lowered, and some will see them remain the same. 
How are property taxes determined in Maine?
Property taxes are how municipalities in Maine raise money. The money mostly goes toward three buckets: county, schools and municipal expenses. In most towns, schools constitute the majority. 
If a town wants to raise money, assessment changes must be approved by a public vote. Tax rate is then determined by dividing the amount to be raised by total taxable value. 
Under the Maine Constitution, property tax must be assessed at its “just value,” which courts have interpreted to mean fair market value. This just value clause is one of the most consequential provisions in the property tax world, according to Peter Lacy, director of the property tax division in Maine Revenue Services and a non-voting task force member. 
“There is a fair amount of discretion for assessors in determining what just value means,” Lacey said, “but it is, at least in theory, a somewhat stable value.”
Municipalities must also follow the assessing standards outlined in state law. For example, one requirement is that the total local valuation of taxable property can’t fall below 70% of fair market value. 
If the state Legislature passes a statutory exemption, the state is on the hook to reimburse at least 50% of the tax loss. If the Legislature requires additional municipal work for a new program, then the state is required to reimburse municipalities for at least 90% of the cost of that additional work.
Those will have to be among the many factors the task force considers in determining its recommendations.

After the pandemic, inflation and cost of housing made starting to teach in Montana very difficult.
But a new program, passed by the 2025 Legislature, has already boosted starting teacher pay and kept districts from struggling with open positions, according to school leaders. In fact, the program has become so successful that nearly every district has been able to leverage it to help retain early-career teachers.
But it was House Bill 252, Student and Teacher Advancement for Results and Success Act, or “STARS,” passed by the 2025 Legislature, that helped boost the starting pay. For districts, it meant a stretch of the budget: The new law says that for districts to qualify for the funding, the starting teacher salary must be 62% of the district-wide average. This helps teachers get to the average level more quickly.
During the Legislature, teachers told of not being able to teach school without a second job, or struggling to find housing even somewhat affordable. A look at most national metrics showed Montana hovered somewhere near the bottom of the nation when it came to starting-teacher salaries — below most nearby states.
For years, Montana had been accused of favoring mid- and later-career teachers at the expense of newly minted professionals. Most districts rejected that notion, but said that unions and schools had more teachers with experience pushing for competitive wages while teachers who were dissatisfied left quickly, leaving fewer voices to advocate to unions and school districts to raise the minimum. Moreover, routine annual raises of 2% to 3%, during the course of a teaching career compounded to better salaries in the cycle of raises, meaning that those who had made it past the first few lean years of teaching salaries were more likely to see an affordable wage.
Erwin Garcia, the superintendent of Billings Public Schools, the largest public school district in the state, said that his district was seeing as many as 100 teachers per year leaving. He noted that not all of the pressure was coming from the pay.
“Most people referred to the mental health of students and the behavior,” Garcia said.
And statistics bear that out: The district recorded the number of times a student struck a teacher — in 2013, the number was zero; last year, it was 33. Eighty-eight percent of those instances were in elementary school, with many being in kindergarten. Garcia believes what children are experiencing at home is brought into a classroom, and teachers begin to modify and teach better behavior.
 Lance Melton, the chief executive officer of the Montana School Boards Association, gave an example of how the new program works. He said Kalispell’s starting pay was 56% of the average salary, so the base salary was increased by roughly 6% for new teachers. He said the goal is for the starting salary to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of average pay for districts to retain the most staff. He said the program has given districts the flexibility to scale their own pay scale, because, for example, the base cost of living in Bozeman or Missoula may be different than Billings or Miles City.
Melton also said that previous efforts looked at the average teacher salary, but that often ignored the base salary, meaning it was harder to recruit and retain teachers.
Garcia said the Billings district did other things to help the school year, including trimming some programs in order to fund fully priorities. For example, one other item Billings Public Schools tried is shortening the school year by increasing the teacher-pupil instruction time. In other words, the length of the school day extended, but the number of days shortened, making it more attractive to teachers as well as parents who want a longer summer break.
Even since the program was implemented, the number of vacancies dropped in Billings from 100 to 30.
While Billings had to stretch to make the budget work, Garcia said all districts in Montana and beyond are struggling, the smaller raises were not keeping pace with the cost of living. The STARS program brings the base level up.
“So when we were giving the teachers a raise, we were not just doing them a favor, we were being fair because $40,000 in 2020 is not what $40,000 is in 2025. What we were really giving, as a district, was being eaten up by inflation,” Garcia said.
He said getting starting teachers earning more is also a quality-of-life-issue: He said he knew teachers working an extra job after school and one on weekends.
“It’s pretty depressing if you have to work a second or a third job. Your quality-of-life is diminished,” Garcia said.
Melton said that the Legislature was able to thread the fine needle between state help and local control. While the state doesn’t mandate any district use STARS, almost every district has in order to bring starting salaries up. He sees that as the surest sign of success.
Montana’s demographics also make it difficult, Melton said. In 1996, public schools had 165,000 kids enrolled — roughly 17.4% of the population. Since then, the overall population has grown, but the number of school-aged children has dropped, causing the percentage to shrink to just above 14%. Those percentages may not sound drastic, but that’s an 11% decrease, and funding is figured on a per-student basis.
Melton said the decline in students hasn’t necessarily meant that districts could cut 11% their budgets because of inflation and overhead costs. As an example, a classroom of 23 where three students leave, means a loss of more than $25,000 for the district, but the resources needed, including a teacher, will not decrease by the same amount.
If Montana’s school-aged demographics had simply kept pace, Montana would have nearly 217,000 students enrolled in public schools. While the population decline is substantial, the amount of money schools get has also decreased.
“When COVID came along, it was an inflection point because we were already behind and then we fell behind because of inflation,” Melton said. “COVID relief funds kind of masked it, but we were already falling behind.”
He said the new increases help put districts back in a position to be competitive.
“This helps with attrition, gives teachers a better of vision of having a comfortable lifestyle,” Melton said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-525409577-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

(Photo courtesy of WEDC)Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation Secretary and CEO Missy Hughes will step down from her position in the Evers Administration on Sept. 19, according to a Friday announcement. 
Hughes was first appointed to the position in 2019 and was confirmed by the state Senate in 2021 and in 2023. She is the first woman to serve in the position. Prior to that, she served as general counsel and chief mission officer at La Farge dairy cooperative, Organic Valley.
Hughes thanked Evers in a statement for “his vision and support for our efforts to build an economy for all.” 
“Each of our state’s successes serves to inspire more development, more innovation, and more growth,” Hughes said. “People start seeing something good happening in their communities, and they want to keep it moving forward. Opportunities to be in the national news for positive accomplishments show companies and talent that Wisconsin competes on the global stage. Every day, Wisconsin is solving problems for the world, and we’ve made sure the world has us on its mind. I’m incredibly grateful to have been a part of this work and the Evers Administration.”
According to Evers’ office, WEDC during Hughes’ tenure has worked with companies to commit over $8 billion in planned investments and to create or retain over 45,000 jobs. 
Hughes’ departure comes as she considers a run for governor in 2026, in the first open race since 2010, though she made no indication of her future plans in her statement. 
Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to run so he can spend time with his family has left a lane for Democratic leaders across the state to consider a run. So far, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez entered the race first and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley launched his campaign this week. Others considering include state Sen. Kelda Roys, Attorney General Josh Kaul and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison).
Evers said Hughes has played an important role in his administration’s focus on “building an economy that works for everyone, investing in Wisconsin’s homegrown talent and Main Streets, and supporting and expanding some of our state’s most iconic brands and companies while attracting new industries and opportunities here to Wisconsin.”

(Courtesy Bill Banowsky/ ""A Savage Art"")When political cartoonist and Australia native Pat Oliphant won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1967 — just a few years after moving to the United States — he wasn’t pleased. He didn’t like the cartoon that won and, as such, didn’t enter the contest again and used his platform to criticize the Pulitzer Board. 
Oliphant’s refusal to hold any person or institution beyond reproach can be seen in most if not all of the more than 10,000 cartoons he’s created over the course of a career spanning 10 presidents, by way of measure. A new documentary, “A Savage Art: The Life & Cartoons of Pat Oliphant,” captures the independent mind behind the work. 

 Pat Oliphant cartoons 








OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA
























































The New York Times notes in its positive review of the recently opened film that even people unfamiliar with Oliphant’s name have probably seen his cartoons. But at least one person wasn’t as familiar with his work before he met Oliphant personally: Bill Banowsky, the documentary’s director. Both Banowsky and Oliphant, now 90 and suffering from macular degeneration and glaucoma, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is how they met, after Banowsky and his wife moved to the city about 10 years ago. 
“I didn’t really know a whole lot about his cartooning until I met him, and then we became fast friends after that,” Banowsky, who has a background as a film producer, lawyer and movie theater owner, told Source NM.
The film also delves into the history of political cartooning, and its intersection with politics and journalism. “A Savage Art” is currently playing in Santa Fe at Banowsky’s movie house, Sky Cinemas, and will be showing in theaters across the country starting Sept. 12 and into the fall. The following interview has been edited for concision and clarity.
 
Source: Were you a fan or buff of political cartoons in general before you met Pat Oliphant?
Bill Banowsky: Not particularly. I think I really kind of came to appreciate the importance of political cartooning as a form of satire, because I am very interested in politics and incredibly disturbed by what is happening in our political world. It’s more disturbing now than in my entire lifetime, and I’m somewhat obsessed about that. The work Pat did and the work great cartoonists are doing today to highlight the outrageous things our government is doing…is needed because the Democrats aren’t meeting the moment in the way that I think an opposition party could and should. So, having this additional line of defense, if you will, is important, and I’m glad that there’s still good work being done. 
Pat Oliphant drew more than 10,000 political cartoons, and won the Pultizer Prize for editorial cartoons in 1967. (Film still/courtesy Bill Banowsky)
How did you approach profiling an artist you admire but also thinking about what his work represents?
Pat was not partisan. One of my favorite cartoons is shown in the very early part of the intro section, and it shows Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty —these two big Humpty Dumpties are identical. One has a T-shirt that says Democrat and one says Republican, and they’re just hugging each other. And this guy asks Alice, ‘Do you know who you’re going to vote for?’ 
I think that really represents Pat’s feeling about partisan politics. He was as brutal toward Bill Clinton as he was toward Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. My feeling in terms of what we wanted to impart in this film is: He’s opposed to greed and to avarice and to overreach and to bad behavior, regardless of who it’s coming from. 
Now, if he were working today, he would be working overtime, because we’ve never seen such greed and avarice and overreach and bad behavior as we’re seeing now. We are, I think, in  uncharted waters. But if you look over the history of his work, going back from [Lyndon B. Johnson] to [Donald Trump], you’ll see that he wasn’t partisan. And he really just touched on Trump — he was losing his eyesight by the time Trump was elected the first time around. Some of the Trump cartoons we have in our film actually are from 2011/ 2012 and [Barack] Obama was president, but Trump was on the stage…and ever the fool. And so he did characterize him in some cartoons back then. But what I love about Pat is his integrity in his work. He called a spade a spade, and it didn’t matter whether it was a Democrat or Republican.
Do you think that approach would work in today’s environment?
No, I think he would be a little bit more brutal toward the Republicans in today’s environment. I don’t think there’s any question about it. He would also point out how feckless the Democrats are. And he did point out how they anointed Hillary Clinton. And then they just did it again with Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. A lot of the problems we’re in right now are the results of the choices of the Democratic Party, and allowing those decisions to be made as they have against the will of the Bernie Sanders’ element of the Democratic Party.

Does the film, then, have a call to action?
I hope so. We want to be part of the resistance to all of the authoritarian impulses that are flowing through our society in our politics right now. We want to inspire people to say no. We want to inspire people to get their voice out in whatever ways they can to stand up to horrible behavior.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oliphantsupremecourt-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

“Unfortunately, I faced very strong resistance to my candidacy this cycle due almost entirely to the stigmatization of mental health in America,” Caraveo said in a statement. “I hope that one day we will see more acceptance and understanding of illnesses like depression, and that leaders at all levels will be able to support those in need in actions and not just words.”
Caraveo was elected in 2022 as the first-ever representative for the 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission after Colorado was awarded an additional congressional seat following the 2020 census. The district encompasses parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County and is the state’s most competitive.
Other Democrats left in the race include state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Westminster, state Treasurer Dave Young, and Amie Baca-Oehlert, former head of the Colorado Education Association. The Democratic primary election will be in June 2026.

Larson relied on familiar themes, faces and places as he began a campaign unlike 13 previous runs for reelection.","Congressman John B. Larson relied on familiar themes, faces and places Friday as he arrived in a union hall in East Hartford to begin a campaign unlike 13 previous runs for reelection: At 77, Larson faces his first serious challenge for the Democratic nomination since winning an open seat in 1998.
Campaign kickoffs are theatrical pieces, and Larson’s featured themes of loyalty, experience and seniority — attributes that made challenges unthinkable in other years in Connecticut, a state historically hostile to primaries against incumbent Democrats.
As the congressman stepped to a microphone on a crowded riser to formally become the fifth Democrat to declare their candidacy in the 1st Congressional District, a snippet of a 1970s pop hit played: “We’re still having fun, and you’re still the one.”
Both notions have been tested this summer. Four challengers, including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, opened campaigns that found no fault with Larson’s liberal, pro-labor voting record but insisted the time had come for new leadership in a struggling Democratic Party.
Larson ignored his challengers to focus on a desire to return to Washington for a 29th and 30th year to fight President Donald Trump on immigration, gun control, student debt, health care, women’s rights, climate and the congressman’s favorite issue, the preservation of Social Security.
“It’s time for Democrats to unite and stand together, because we’re in a fight. You know it, and I know it. So I ask you, are you ready for a fight?” Larson said, pausing briefly for the certain affirmative answer. Smiling, he added, “I officially announce my campaign for congressman from the First District.”
He promised action on his agenda in the first 100 days after Democrats retake the majority in the House, though Republicans would still control the White House and  most likely the Senate.
East Hartford is home to Larson and his large extended family. He began his career more than 45 years ago as a school board member, then was elected to the council and state Senate. His brother, Tim, is a former mayor and state senator. He grew up in Mayberry Village, public housing.
The current mayor, Connor Martin, once worked at Goodwin University for another Larson brother, Dan Larson. And Larson was introduced by his niece, Arianna Larson. To launch the campaign, he chose a familiar setting, the International Association of Machinists hall across the street from Pratt & Whitney.
“The thing about a big family and loyal friends — when you attack one of us, you attack all of us, and we stick together,” Larson said.
An old friend, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, sat in the front row near Joe Suggs, a retiree who competed with Larson for the congressional seat in the 1998 primary. Kevin Sullivan, a former state Senate leader and lieutenant governor, also came to show support, as did former state Sen. Eric Coleman. Sullivan and Coleman are in their 70s. Clyburn is 85.

Martin, the mayor, turns 34 next week. He said the congressman and two of his brothers have been mentors.
“His story is not very different than mine, and probably many of us in the room, growing up in public housing, right? Not having generational wealth, right?” Martin said. “His family, having to work two to three jobs to take care of their family is a common story in America, especially with middle class America.”
Larson called out the two establishment figures at the top of his campaign: the chair is Daniel Papermaster, a lawyer and former aide to two former senators, Chris Dodd and Joseph Lieberman; and the finance chair is Alan Lazowski, a wealthy philanthropist and chief executive of Laz Parking.
Lazowski was a key supporter of Bronin’s in Hartford.
“But John has been a dear friend for over 40 years, and he’s always delivered for our district, for all 27 towns, for Hartford,” Lazowski said. “And I believe that he’s the right leader we need to get things done. His seniority in Congress is unparalleled, and you can’t just come in as a freshman and have an impact.”
Lazowski said he tried to talk Bronin out of running, and he dismissed concerns about Larson’s age. His father, Rabbi Phillip Lazowski, is 95 and working on his 16th book.
“He works harder than anyone I know, and John has that spirit,” Lazowski said.

Joe Toner, the executive director of the Connecticut Building Trades Council, which represents 30,000 union construction workers, said the council already has Larson, an old friend. 
“He’s been by our side for the last 27 years, 28 years, and that’s not going to change. He’s never been a bad vote for us in the building trades. Quite frankly, he’s never been a bad vote for the district,” Toner said. “So we’re honored to support him. We’re going to stick with him. This is no time to make a change.”
Ruth Fortune, 37, a Hartford school board member, filed campaign papers July 3 and was quickly followed by Councilman Jack Perry, 35, of Southington. By the end of August, the field included Bronin, 46, and the 43-year-old Gilchrest.
On Friday, Bronin said Larson’s announcement was evidence that time has passed him by. Pledging action in 100 days on an agenda he cannot deliver was wrongheaded, Bronin said.
“While I have an enormous amount of respect for John Larson, I don’t think John Larson recognizes the moment that we’re in,” Bronin said. “Voters don’t want empty promises. They don’t want to be misled. Voters want to see that we recognize that if we’re going to deliver the things that our country needs, we have to build a different kind of political movement.”
Bronin waited to talk to reporters at a riverside park in East Hartford after Larson’s event. Gilchrest offered a similar critique in an emailed statement, expressing admiration and a demand for a change.
“I’m not running for Congress as a referendum on John Larson — I’m running because Congress as a whole isn’t listening to the voices of everyday people and has failed to deliver the change families need,” she said. “We can’t keep expecting the same people to do better next time.”
“Our families deserve a representative who will meet this moment with urgency and deliver real solutions — as I’ve done here in Connecticut on paid leave, gun safety and reproductive freedom. We can’t wait any longer.”
Larson left the union hall for a fundraising lunch at Cafe Aura, the Manchester restaurant owned by Geno Auriemma. Larson reported having less than $300,000 in his campaign account as of June 30. Bronin reported raising $500,000 in his first week.
The next campaign finance reporting period is in October.

(Photo by Jeff T. Green/Getty Images)The federal government is unenthusiastic about cranking up its biggest cleanup project next month at the Hanford nuclear site in south-central Washington. But it will meet an Oct. 15 deadline to bring the so-called glassification facility online, the U.S. Department of Energy said Thursday. 
Whether the department may move later to shut down the facility, which will be used to turn radioactive waste into glass, is still hazy.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., talked with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Wednesday about earlier reports the Department of Energy wanted to back out of firing up the long-delayed Hanford plant by Oct. 15 and go to an undefined alternate method to neutralize 56 million gallons of radioactive waste.
That waste is stored in 177 leak-prone underground tanks in the center of the Hanford nuclear reservation and is at risk of seeping into the Columbia River.
Wright acknowledged to Murray that he wants to stall work on, or possibly eliminate, a completed facility to convert 20 million to 25 million gallons of the least radioactive tank wastes (dubbed “low-activity wastes”) into a benign glass. The process involves mixing the wastes and glass flakes and melting them together.
The department’s Thursday statement and Wright’s discussion with Murray contain ambiguous statements that, while promising glassification will begin by Oct 15, do not rule out the Department of Energy switching directions later. 
Murray’s office acknowledged these ambiguities and said the Department of Energy still needs to answer many questions to clarify its intentions and thought processes. In its statement, the Department of Energy’s Washington, D.C. headquarters did not address the Washington State Standard’s questions about the lack of clarity.
“I need to see real evidence that this administration is moving forward on our decades-long effort to turn nuclear waste into glass at Hanford. I also need an explanation for the conflicting information I have gotten from the Department over the last 48 hours—and I need the Deputy Secretary to sign off on key documents so the completion of hot commissioning at the Waste Treatment Plant can move forward,” Murray said in a statement on Friday morning.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, in a written statement Thursday, said that if the federal government backs away from its glassification plans at the site, it would be a “stunning waste of resources, a violation of multiple legal agreements and a slap in the face to the workers who have brought us to this point.”
“We will be challenging this decision. There’s too much at stake for the people of Washington and our environment,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson planned to discuss the issue further at a press conference on Friday afternoon in Kennewick.
On Wednesday, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is monitoring the situation, including preparing to leap in if the federal government tries to stray from its legal obligations on this project.
Washington State Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said he’d seen news reports and heard from Murray’s office that the federal government has decided to abandon its efforts to commission the waste treatment plant. 
“If these reports are accurate, it would violate legally binding agreements,” Sixkiller said. “We are now just days away from beginning to treat low-activity radioactive waste at Hanford, and any delay or change in plans would threaten years of work and billions of dollars in investments.”
‘I am not satisfied’ 
Murray said that Wright “admitted to me during a phone call that the Department of Energy is planning to curb hot commissioning at the Waste Treatment Plant at Hanford — an astonishingly senseless and destructive move and a threat to the entire nuclear cleanup mission at Hanford.”
The secretary’s comments, Murray said, didn’t track with “positive news” from the lead contractor on the project, Bechtel, that safety reviews and technical tests for one of the waste treatment melters were completed, and the facility was on track to begin operating next month.
“Not only has this facility already been built, but commissioning is ahead of schedule. Secretary Wright claimed that moving forward with hot commissioning is an issue of safety, but records do not corroborate his assertion,” Murray added. 
Wright did not elaborate to Murray about the nature of the safety issue. The Department of Energy did not reply Thursday to emailed questions on this and other matters.
“Whether Secretary Wright was given bad information or is simply confused about how the (glassification) facility works, I can’t say, but I am not satisfied by his explanation for why DOE has suddenly decided to stall progress on the Waste Treatment Plant,” Murray said.
Murray also said she’d put a hold on the nomination of Tim Walsh to oversee Hanford.
Walsh is Wright’s intended replacement for Roger Jarrell, who was fired Monday from his position as principal deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management, which oversees Hanford’s cleanup. 
Politico E&E reported that Wright wants to replace Jarrell with Walsh as part of a move to take Hanford’s cleanup in a different direction.
Decades of cleanup still ahead 
Hanford has been looking at glassifying its tank wastes since the 1990s. 
It began construction in 2002, with the first glassification plant legally scheduled to go online in 2009 — 16 years before it actually will. This first plant is supposed to take care of 40 to 50 percent of the tanks’ “low-activity” wastes. 
The master plan has been to build two low-activity glassification plants plus a third to handle the site’s 5 million to 6 million gallons of high-level radioactive tank wastes. 
The entire project’s original budget in 2002 was $4 billion. This has grown to roughly $30 billion. The first low-activity waste plant cost slightly more than $9 billion. 
Hanford’s cleanup is governed by a frequently modified 35-year-old legal contract among the Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state ecology department, plus some federal court decrees — meaning the cleanup schedules and standards are legally locked in. 
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs, including those exploded in New Mexico and over Nagasaki in 1945. 
That development work created many billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive wastes, the worst 56 million gallons of which were pumped into 177 underground tanks. About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
The tanks are considered the worst radiological contamination problem in the Western Hemisphere. 
Hanford’s current legal target calls for glassifying all wastes by 2052. The Department of Energy has internally moved those targets back to 2069, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office. 
After four years of closed-door negotiation, the Department of Energy, the EPA and the state agreed to try encasing the contents of 22 tanks in grout, which is a cement-like substance.
The Government Accountability Office has been bullish on the grout idea. 
Since 2017, the watchdog agency has issued three reports strongly recommending that the Department of Energy look at replacing the second low-activity-waste glassification plant with a plan to grout the roughly 50 percent of low-activity wastes not handled by the first low-activity plant. Grouting is theoretically a faster and cheaper option.
Washington officials have always been skeptical about grout, citing its lacking of track record with the types of wastes found in Hanford’s tanks. The Department of Energy has been mum in the past about its preferences.
The 2024 agreement calls for grouting to be used on low-activity wastes found in 22 tanks that also contain high-level wastes. A decision on grouting technology — which will then lead to budgeting and scheduling — is due by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, all 149 single-shell tanks and the majority of the 28 double-shell tanks are way past their design lives. So far, only one double-shell tank has sprung a leak, in its inner wall, and thus can no longer be used. 
Roughly one-third of the single-shell tanks are confirmed leakers and cannot be used to store wastes. At least 1 million gallons have leaked into the ground, with some already reaching the Columbia River seven miles away. 
If leaks occur in more double-shell tanks, that could delay glassification by several years and create further problems. It would take seven years and $1.5 billion, the Government Accountability Office has reported, to build four 1-million-gallon double-shell tanks.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/radioactive-waste-sign-hanford-1024x605.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Despite a last-minute scramble, California Senate leaders failed to fix an environmental law rollback for advanced manufacturing, leaving pollution concerns untouched as session ends. 


In June, California Democrats rushed to significantly roll back the state’s landmark environmental law to clear the path for land development.
Environmental justice advocates weren’t happy. Because of changes signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, certain developments now are exempt from environmental reviews, which advocates fear will cut out tribal community feedback, threaten endangered species and lead to more pollution for some of the state’s most at-risk residents. Facing backlash, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire promised a fix.
“That is an issue that we’re going to need to continue to focus on in the weeks and months to come before we leave this session in September,” McGuire told his fellow senators in June.
He’s now run out of time. With just hours until the legislative session ends, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and McGuire have not agreed on how to meaningfully address those environmental concerns, punting the discussion to the fall. 
“This is a complex policy issue and we must get [it] right for Californians,” said Nick Miller, a spokesperson for Rivas, when asked why the talks stalled. “Our assessment is it needs to go through a public process with input and discussion.”
The differences laid bare the growing rift between the pro-development Assembly, which has pushed to cut red tape to build more housing faster, and the Senate, which has been more skeptical about private development without labor and environmental protections. 
The lack of progress has angered environmental justice advocates and lawmakers, who said the leaders failed to make good on their promises. 
“To say that the trust has broken is, I think, is a little bit of an understatement,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat who was among 35 lawmakers to urge legislative leaders to fix the law in August. “Several of us have asked to have this fixed, and we were told that it was going to get fixed, and now we’re here and we’re told that it’s not.” 
This week, California leaders negotiated and released a budget-related bill to implement the June updates with minimal changes. But the Senate’s budget committee shelved the bill Wednesday amid senators’ criticism that it didn’t go far enough to regulate pollution, and environmental groups called the bill “premature and harmful.” 
‘To say that the trust has broken is, I think, is a little bit of an understatement.’Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat
In a symbolic move, Senate leaders announced Wednesday a separate, last-minute measure to reinstate environmental review requirements for some high-polluting manufacturing plants within 300 feet of homes and schools, despite knowing it did not have time to pass this year. 
“We thought it was really important for the public to see that when we made that commitment, we meant it. That we were not just talking about it,” said Senate Budget Committee Chair Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and a major champion of the environmental review exemptions and housing construction. 
“We would prefer to do it now,” he added. “But we need a three-party agreement to do anything.”
That going-nowhere proposal did not satisfy environmental groups. High-polluting plants have the potential to harm residents far beyond 300 feet, which amounts to half a city block, said Asha Sharma, state policy manager for Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.
Adding to the chaos, Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a San Rafael Democrat, on Friday introduced an uber-last-minute measure that largely reflected what environmental groups say they want. The proposal would restore environmental scrutiny for projects like hotels and resorts, developments on habitats for protected species and most advanced manufacturing plants. 
That proposal could not be voted on until next year.
Polluting facilities pose a ‘massive problem’
The June update exempts “advanced manufacturing” facilities such as hydrogen production facilities, plastic recycling facilities and lithium mining sites from environmental reviews as long as they are located in industrial zones and not on protected lands. 
In the months after, several advanced manufacturing projects have been proposed, including facilities on the San Bruno Mountain and in Solano County.
Environmental justice groups say restoring environmental reviews for projects like these is a priority, because those facilities are some of the most hazardous and polluting facilities and are often located near low-income communities of color. The environmental review process is typically the only chance residents get to voice concerns about developments near their homes, Sharma said.
Some lawmakers said that’s why they won’t vote this week for the budget bill to allocate money to implement the June reform. Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat on the budget committee, called the manufacturing exemptions “incredibly expansive” and a “massive problem.” 
“Most of us thought: ‘Why would we possibly want to vote for this bill … when the commitments in terms of cleanup legislation haven’t been met?” he told CalMatters.
Frustrations grow over last-minute dealmaking
Talks to tighten environmental regulations stalled amid the governor and legislative leaders’ fast-moving secret negotiations on major energy and climate deals this week, a common occurrence near the end of the legislative session.
The stifled effort contrasts how quickly California’s top Democrats scaled back the environmental rules in June. The governor at the time threatened to reject the state budget if the deal did not come through. The rollback was tucked into budget trailer bills — a tool leaders have increasingly used to rush major policies through with little public scrutiny.
“That is so ironic, because apparently it was totally fine to jam everyone on an exemption for advanced manufacturing … but God forbid you rush a cleanup bill,” Delfino said.
The rushed nature of the June deal, critics say, is why a “cleanup” is necessary.
“It was rammed down everyone’s throats,” Allen said. “It’s probably why we feel the need to push back on this particular issue because … this was a particularly aggressive and out-of-whack set of changes.”
“I continue to be extremely disappointed with anyone who takes advantage of this notion that delay gives leverage,” said Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Torrance Democrat who said he didn’t cast a vote on the June rollback because of the manufacturing exemptions. “It prevents us from having a more open, transparent and democratic process to fully debate these important policy proposals.”
Even those who did vote for the rollback argue for more limits placed on manufacturing. Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, said he grew up next to a manufacturing plant and suffers from asthma to this day.
“It needs to be addressed immediately. …We are not in the 1970s and ‘80s anymore,” he said in a hearing Thursday.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/041323-CONSTRUCTION-MHN-CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin ExaminerThe U.S. Department of Education has abruptly terminated nearly $11 million for two grant programs that have been helping Wisconsin serve children with vision and hearing loss and others receiving special education services, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
Wisconsin is one of several states to be affected by the cuts to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part D grants. Others include Washington, Oregon and a consortium of New England states including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, according to ProPublica.
Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly called on the Trump administration to reconsider the decision in a statement this week. 
“Make no mistake, losing these funds will directly impact our ability to serve some of our most vulnerable kids,” Underly said. “Wisconsin had planned work with these funds that includes direct support for deafblind learners and their families and efforts to recruit and retain new special education teachers.”
According to DPI, the Trump administration said the programs “reflect the prior administration’s priorities and policy preferences and conflict with those of the current administration.” 
The first program to be affected is the Wisconsin Deafblind Technical Assistance Project, which provides assistive technology tools, coaching, family support and professional training for young people up to the age of 21 with vision and hearing loss. The program currently serves 170 students, and of those, 85% have four or more disabilities. 
The funding cut comes in the middle of a five-year grant cycle. Wisconsin was supposed to get a total of about $550,000 that was expected to last through September 2028.
“These are kids who depend on specialized support just to access their guaranteed right to a free and appropriate public education,” Dr. Underly said. “Losing these dollars at this point in the year will be devastating for the kids who need these supports the most.”
The other program being cut is the State Personnel Development Grant, which focuses on helping address Wisconsin’s critical special education teacher shortage as well as assisting with recruitment, retention and development.
The grant funds from the program, which totaled $10.5 million, was helping to fund a number of programs, including the Special Educator Induction Program. In its first year, the state program helped 280 new special education teachers. 
“At a time when schools in every corner of the state are struggling to find and keep special educators, cutting this support is unconscionable and harmful to every student with an IEP,” Underly said.
According to DPI data, only 46% of new special education teachers in Wisconsin remain in the field after seven years. 
The state agency plans to appeal the Trump administration’s decision.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland GovernorNew Hampshire is the only New England state not participating in a regional effort of Northeastern states to create vaccine guidance separate from the federal government. However, Massachusetts Health Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein said this week his team is “actively communicating” with New Hampshire’s public health agencies about the effort.
Neither the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services nor Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office responded to the Bulletin’s requests for comment.
In August, a group of public health officials from eight states — Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — met to discuss banding together and creating their own set of recommendations for vaccines separate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The effort comes amid concerns about the actions of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic appointed by President Donald Trump. In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. In June, he fired 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing many of them with vaccine skeptics. And, in August, he cut $500 million across 22 projects that sought to research mRNA vaccines for respiratory illnesses like influenza and COVID-19. Health officials throughout the country have decried the moves as dangerous and argued they’re not based in scientific fact.
Goldstein, speaking to a group of health journalists in Boston Monday, said the states’ August meeting was a continuation of discussions that had been ongoing all year.
“Back in January and February, states across the Northeast came together to start thinking about how we can operate and not replace CDC,” he said, “but backfill if parts of CDC start to fail and augment where CDC maybe wasn’t doing a good job in the first place.”
Goldstein described the group of state health officials as “a collaborative that has no name and a collaborative that is very cautious.”
“Nevertheless, we are a collaborative that has worked together on real, concrete issues,” he said.
Despite New Hampshire’s absence from the collaborative, Goldstein said communications continue with New Hampshire and other states.
“We’re having real conversations with red states, and they appreciate what we’re doing and lean on what we’re doing,” Goldstein said. “And also they can’t politically be the ones who are publicly coming out with the guidance.”
Goldstein said he expects the collaborative to expand. Indeed, since August’s meeting, Delaware has joined the group, Delaware Public Media reported this week.
“Folks in other parts of the country know what we’re doing,” he said. “They’re listening to us. They are interested in our recommendations, and I think we may end up as a much larger collaborative at the end.”
Earlier this morning, a group of Western states — California, Oregon, and Washington (Hawaii has since joined) — announced a similar but separate effort called the West Coast Health Alliance. That group of states have been more forthright in identifying their collaborative as a response to Kennedy and Trump’s. The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington released a joint statement: “President Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people. The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences.”
Many in the public health field have expressed mixed feelings about the effort. They’re afraid of the impacts of Kennedy’s policies and the turmoil he’s created in the federal government’s public health apparatus, but also fearful of how conflicting health recommendations and guidance will confuse Americans.
Dr. Debra Houry was the chief medical officer and deputy director at the CDC until she, along with a group of other high level officials, resigned in protest over the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez. Asked by a Bulletin reporter about these two collaboratives, Houry said, “I get why people are doing it, but it’s going to cause some confusion and haves and have-nots.”
She also worries about “medical tourism by states” if providers decide to offer vaccines or other care only where it is recommended.
Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, called this “a balkanization of public health.” She compared it to gun policy.
“With firearms, they flow across state lines, which is why we see higher rates of firearms homicide and suicide in California after there are gun shows in Nevada,” Ranney said. “Similarly vaccinations, if you don’t have a group vaccinated in one state, it’s not like everyone in that state stays in that state. People move across state lines all the time.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vaccineassociation.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Josh Stein on Friday. (Photo illustration of a COVID-19 vaccine by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Gov. Josh Stein signed an order Friday afternoon allowing eligible North Carolinians to receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine without obtaining a prescription.
This includes senior citizens as well as adults over 18 who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list of high risk conditions, including asthma, COPD, diabetes, ADHD, heart disease and cancer.
“Right now, North Carolina is one of only a handful of states where people must get a prescription before they can get a shot at the pharmacy,” Stein said. “This is unnecessary red tape. It is time for North Carolina to get in line with other states across the country.”
Pharmacies may ask the patient certain questions or ask them to attest to the conditions that would make them eligible, but medical documentation is not necessary.
The Medicaid program is currently paying for COVID vaccines for individuals who are beneficiaries, said Larry Greenblatt, state health director and chief medical officer at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
“Vaccines are one of the most effective means available to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death,” NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said. “They help protect the health of children and adults, their families, and the entire community from the spread of infectious disease.”
Following state law, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina can administer those vaccines recommended by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) , but ACIP has yet to give its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines this season, NC Newsline previously reported.
ACIP is expected to release recommendations later in September, according to Stein’s office.
The governor’s office shared a list of retail pharmacies that have announced they have the updated COVID-19 vaccine available, to date: Brisson Drugs, Carlie C’s, Central Pharmacy of Durham, Costco, CVS Pharmacy, Food Lion, Hope Mills Pharmacy, Fairmont Drug Company, Ingles Markets, Med Smart Pharmacy, Med Source Pharmacy, Publix Pharmacies, Sam’s Club, Walgreens and Walmart.

SC grand juries join calls to allow cellphone signal jamming in state prisons

The three-person Federal Communications Commission will vote at the end of the month on whether to change a longstanding rule barring states from blocking cellphone signals in prisons.
Acting U.S Attorney Bryan Stirling pushed for the change for 12 years as head of the prisons agency — including making trips to Washington to testify — without getting anywhere due to pushback from the telecommunications industry. He’s pleased to finally see real movement, he said.
“I was frankly stunned, and happily so,” Stirling told reporters Friday.
Stirling and other law enforcement officials have long pointed to the dangers of allowing inmates access to contraband cellphones. Using the devices, prisoners have run drug rings, operated scams and ordered hits on people’s lives, officials have said.
Last month, the state grand juries joined the calls for action after signing off on numerous indictments of people already serving time for another crime.
“It’s a matter of public safety,” Stirling said. “It’s safety for the prisons, it’s safety for the public, it’s safety for the state of South Carolina.”
The change is far from final. If the commission votes Sept. 30 to move forward, people will have an opportunity to offer public comment on the possible change. The commission must then vote again before officially changing the rule.
If the change is approved, South Carolina will be ready, said Stirling and Joel Anderson, who took the agency’s helm in April.

Over the past two years, legislators have spent $18.5 million to install and maintain technology in state prisons that can identify cellphone signals, which agency officials can then report to the phone numbers’ carriers to get the phones shut off. But that’s a tedious process.
The same company providing that technology can add on a feature blocking all cellphone signals, Stirling and Anderson said. Stirling made sure that was written into the contract when the state bought the technology to prevent starting a $34 million project from scratch if the rule changed, he said.
“One of the things I wanted to make sure is we didn’t have to go back and rip all the equipment out and redo it,” Stirling said.
South Carolina was the first state in the country licensed to use the method of tracking and shutting down each individual cellphone, which officials have compared to a game of “Whac-A-Mole.” Last year, the technology resulted in 2,600 phones being shut off within the six prisons that used it, Anderson and Stirling said.
But reporting each phone is time-consuming, and it didn’t stop more phones from coming into the prisons, Anderson said.
Jamming can also block Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals necessary to fly drones over prisons’ 60-foot netting, which inmates use to deliver drugs and other contraband, Anderson said.
“What we have today, it’s really helped us a lot, but it can be better,” Anderson said. “That’s what we want. We want it better.”
The use of cellphones inside prisons has endangered prison officers as well as the general public, Stirling and Anderson said.

In 2010, inmates ordered a hit on anti-contraband officer Capt. Robert Johnson, who survived being shot six times at his Sumter home. In 2018, Army veteran Jared Johns died by suicide after becoming the target of an inmate-run extortion scheme. And in 2022, a man was charged with setting fire to the home of Lt. Francisco Collazo in what authorities believe was an inmate-ordered hit following a contraband bust.
Prisoners used cellphones to run a massive international drug enterprise that resulted in convictions for 40 people, both inside and outside of the state’s prison system. Unmonitored phones also make it possible for inmates to coordinate the smuggling of drugs into the prisons, which can hinder the rehabilitation process for prisoners struggling with addiction, Stirling said.
Cellphones put prisoners themselves in danger. If an inmate faces threats at one prison, officials used to be able to transfer them and keep them safe. Now, other inmates can communicate their feuds across the state, making sure threats follow a prisoner wherever they end up, Stirling said.
“This is something that I think is just vitally important for the public safety in South Carolina,” Stirling said.
The prohibition on jamming cellphone signals relies on a part of the federal Communications Act of 1934 barring anyone from interfering with any “authorized” radio signals. Prisoners’ illicit cellphones shouldn’t qualify because they’re not authorized to be in prisons, argues a commission report on the possible rule change released this week.

Federal prisons are allowed to jam cellphone signals, since the law bars only states from interfering with radio signals. That rule never made sense to Stirling, especially in places like Bennettsville, where federal and state prisons sit less than three miles apart, he said.
“If the federal government can do it, why can’t the states?” Stirling said.
Inmates would still be able to call their families using prison-supplied-and-monitored telephones and tablets, which will be able to get through the jamming, Stirling and Anderson said. The signal blockers also won’t affect officers’ radios used to communicate throughout prisons, the directors said.
“I’m telling you, jamming is the answer for these cellphones,” Anderson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3863-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Lawrence McClure talks to reporters following a Legislative Budget Commission meeting on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s budget outlook for the coming year is stable, but the prospect of potential deficits in the near future led the state House budget chief to suggest Friday that his chamber once again seek to lower state spending.
Lawmakers earlier this year clashed over the budget, leading to a lengthy stalemate that pushed the 2025 session into overtime. At the time, House Republicans claimed the state had been spending too much money and needed cuts to avoid future budget shortfalls.
In the end, the Legislature passed a smaller budget paired with substantial tax cuts designed in part to limit how much money the state receives from taxpayers.
A new long-range financial outlook for the state shows that Florida legislators should have a nearly $3.8 billion budget surplus for the 2026-27 fiscal year, which opens on July 1. But that surplus is projected to turn into a deficit the following fiscal year year and grow to a $6.57 billion hole in 2028-29 fiscal year.
The Legislative Budget Commission, which annually must approve a long-range financial outlook, heard a presentation on the projections before voting to approve it at its Friday meeting.
After the vote, House Budget Committee Chair Rep. Lawrence McClure, R-Dover, said it was his intention to have the “House dig even deeper this year for efficiencies, waste, and ineffective programs. I believe it to be our duty.”
“Everyone understands that we’ve got to keep chipping away at this,” McClure said.
McClure did not mention any specific areas for cuts, but noted that healthcare and education were the largest portions of the budget. Many “cost drivers” could be looked at, including the health insurance program for state workers that is once again projected to go into the red over the next few years, he said.
But McClure added that one way for legislators to tackle future deficits is to refrain from “spending as much of the new money.”
“We’re not at a place yet where we have to go in and cut services to the core,” he said.
Legislators sign off on a new outlook each September. The Legislature won’t begin work on a new budget until next year’s session starts in January.
The House and Senate squabbled over the budget this past spring as House Republicans insisted that spending had been growing too much the previous few years under Gov. Ron DeSantis and previous legislative leaders.
House Republicans pushed for billions in tax cuts as a way to reduce the amount of money in government coffers. After an extended session, the Legislature wound up passing a more than $115 billion budget that was smaller than the 2024 budget. But lawmakers did not cut taxes nearly as deeply as House Speaker Daniel Perez wanted.
Senate Majority Leader Jim Boyd, who also sits on the legislative budget commission, told McClure that the Senate “shares your concern and desire for fiscal responsibility.”

(Photo via Getty Images)Rhode Island has joined the growing list of states, including its two New England neighbors, in taking steps to ensure state residents can access the latest COVID-19 vaccine, despite more limited federal criteria. 
Gov. Dan McKee on Friday announced two separate state measures that counteract recent federal criteria adopted in August by the Food and Drug Administration, which restricted updated booster shots to people 65 and older, or with underlying health conditions. The FDA’s policy is far more limiting than in past years, prompting strong pushback by established medical organizations and some state officials.
“We are taking action in Rhode Island to ensure that the public health turmoil at the national level does not affect the ability of Rhode Islanders to access vaccines that keep us healthy and safe,” McKee said in a statement. “It’s crucial that people who want to get the COVID-19 vaccine have the ability to do so in Rhode Island.”
 A new Rhode Island Department of Health order explicitly authorizes pharmacists to continue giving COVID-19 shots to all patients ages 3 and older. The four-page order, which remains in place until withdrawn or replaced by something else, suggests that pharmacists can give the shot as an “off-label” use to those who don’t meet the more restrictive federal criteria. That aligns with recommendations by major medical organizations, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for last year’s vaccine. The CDC has not yet issued guidance on the 2025-2026 vaccine, though its advisory panel on immunization is slated to meet at its Atlanta campus on Sept. 18 and 19.
“We will continue to make the COVID-19 vaccine available, and we will continue to be the source of science and fact-based information about vaccines in Rhode Island,” Dr. Jerry Larkin, state health director, said in a statement.
A separate notice issued Friday by the health department and Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner requires health insurance companies to keep covering COVID-19 shots. Insurers have already told state officials they intend to comply with this directive, according to McKee’s office. 
“Access to the COVID-19 vaccine promotes public health and mitigates outbreaks of disease that raise insurance costs and strain our hospitals and health care providers,” Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King said in a statement. “Vaccine coverage without patient cost-sharing eliminates financial barriers for consumers and preserves necessary access.”
Last week, Massachusetts became the first state in the country to defy federal restrictions by ensuring state insurers provide coverage for COVID-19 shots. On Wednesday, Connecticut followed suit with a pair of policies authorizing pharmacy distribution and mandating insurance coverage.
Other states have adopted similar policies this week, including Delaware, Virginia, New Mexico, Arizona, Maine and North Carolina.
State medical leaders backed McKee’s decision in separate statements, including Dr. Kara Stavros, president of the Rhode Island Medical Society, and Dr. Scott A. Rivkees, president of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Evidence of the COVID-19 virus rose in recent weeks, according to state monitoring of wastewater facilities. In the week of Sept. 6, the virus level was considered “high,” while emergency department visits and hospital admissions have started to tick up, according to online data. More than 90 people have died from COVID-19 this season, while 60 died due to the flu.
State vaccination rates for the 2025-2026 flu season have not been made publicly available.
The latest COVID shot is expected to be available at primary care provider offices in the coming weeks, according to McKee’s office. Adults can also get boosters at retail pharmacies or health centers, though children between six months and five years old should go to a pediatrician or family physician.
More information about where to get vaccinated, including arranging transportation, is available on the state health department website.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) The line at a local food bank’s weekly distribution in Albuquerque’s International District has increased in the last few years, organizers say, as neighbors in nearby homes join the queue alongside the growing population of unhoused residents.
Marissa Brown, who runs the Roadrunner Food Bank distribution, says the line has increased by approximately 50 households to 225 each week. She estimated a line once composed mostly of unhoused people pushing carts is now probably 60% people with roofs over their heads.
“We are just seeing more of our neighbors who are housed coming, too, because it’s just hard for everyone,” Brown told Source New Mexico as people worked their way through the line Friday morning. “We’re really pleased that we can just expand that reach to anyone who might need it, but it certainly has expanded.”
Even before cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program contained in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” take effect, President Donald Trump’s second term has already hurt the food bank’s ability to feed hungry people in a state where more than one in five residents has food stamps, food bank officials told Source New Mexico on Friday. 
By the #s: More than half of NM groceries, convenience stores at ‘high risk’ due to SNAP cuts

For example, inflation has reduced how much food Roadrunner can buy with donations or grant funding, and the federal “Department of Government Efficiency” cuts to emergency food assistance programs earlier this year by 30 truckloads of food worth a little more than $1 million, according to Roadrunner officials. 
On Friday, that reduced budget meant food recipients had less variety to choose from, she said, as they walked through the line at the International District Library, though the food bank did happen upon a donation of flower bouquets, giving recipients a “surprise gift of joy.”
Still, Brown called it “frightening” to consider what will happen if the food bank has to rely solely on donations as people lose SNAP benefits, both at the distribution she runs and at food banks and other nonprofits across the state. 
“Even though the SNAP cuts haven’t quite happened yet, the [existing] benefits are not lasting as long,” she said. “So folks always do express how grateful they are that we’re here week after week, because they just wouldn’t be able to make it through the month.”
Food banks across New Mexico have previously warned that they don’t have the capacity to feed all New Mexicans if SNAP goes away. 
Jason Riggs, Roadrunner Food Bank’s director of advocacy and public policy, told Source New Mexico in a phone interview Friday that the Albuquerque food line, which is growing and feeding an increasingly diverse group of people across the income spectrum, is a harbinger of the near future after SNAP cuts go into effect. 
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

“Whenever there’s changes to SNAP, we see food lines grow,” he said. 
New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee analysts told lawmakers at an interim legislative meeting Wednesday that one-in-four New Mexico children live in households without consistent or adequate food. 
Of the roughly 460,000 New Mexicans who receive SNAP benefits, more than 36,000 could lose them entirely due to their immigration status or new work requirements, according to the LFC analysts. 
The Legislature will convene Oct. 1 in a special session primarily to discuss how the state will adapt to the federal cuts. 
Riggs said he hopes the Legislature focuses immediately on how it will mitigate the impacts of SNAP’s new work requirements, which go into effect Jan. 1. 
“Within months, there’s thousands of people that are suddenly going to be subject to work requirements,” he said, and the state has to figure out how to explain what’s happening and identify resources as soon as possible. 
“All that has to happen extremely quickly in order for thousands not to just flat out lose SNAP. So regardless of where we point the finger for people losing SNAP, our concern at the food bank is people suddenly losing their food resource and relying more on our food pantries.”

One of the people who could lose benefits is Kyle Neri, a military veteran who has lived on Albuquerque streets for the last few years with his dogs Mama and Bailey. He picked up a bag of mandarins and tins of beans and oatmeal Friday morning, along with a Ziploc bag of dog kibble. 
He said a car crash a few years ago damaged his spine, but he was denied disability assistance. He’s making do with $120 a month in food stamps, he said, along with a veteran’s disability payment of $700 for his Army service in the late 1990s. But inflation is already making it nearly impossible, he said, to feed himself while trying to save for permanent housing. He said he’s “of course” worried about losing food stamps amid rising food costs.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-12 19:30:55+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Special education schools fail to provide required services,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/12/report-special-education-schools-fail-to-provide-required-services/,State auditors wrote that some private special education schools in CT are failing to give students all the services they need.,"Auditors raised concerns on Wednesday that some private special education schools in Connecticut are failing to give students all the services they need, hiring staff without background checks and relying on substitutes who lack certification. 
State auditors looked at records from five special education schools across the state — The High Road School of Wallingford, Adelbrook Academy in Cromwell, the Grace S. Webb School in Hartford, University School JPE in Bridgeport and the American School for the Deaf. In each case, the auditors reviewed services rendered for one fifth of the students at the school. 
The report found that the High Road School of Wallingford, for example, provided to its students less than a third of the individual services for fine motor skills that were required in their students Individualized Education Plans, or IEPs — documents created by school districts that outline exactly what services a student should be receiving each year. The school also provided less than half of the individual and group counseling services that its students’ educational plans demanded. 
The Grace S. Webb School in Hartford, part of Hartford Hospital’s Institute of Living, provided about half of the group counseling services that its students’ plans demanded and 68% of individual counseling services required in those plans. 
In their responses to the audit, the schools argued that chronic absenteeism prevented them from being able to offer all the services that their students were required to receive.  
“We serve students who struggle with chronic truancy, as defined by the State,” the Grace S. Webb School responded in a statement to the audit, adding that they offer specialized programs that attempt to reduce student absenteeism that can be driven by psychiatric or emotional problems. “Given the population of the students who struggle to maintain consistent attendance at school, we often deliver services in non-traditional settings as students can tolerate, which may not have always been captured fully in documentation.” 
The High Road School of Wallingford gave a similar response. 
“Chronic absenteeism and other attendance challenges are common among our referred student population and can significantly limit our ability to deliver scheduled services,” they wrote, adding that they have added in a new monitoring system meant to help the school reach out quickly if a child is not attending or engaging. 
A spokesperson for the High Road Schools told CT Mirror that most of the school’s students come in mid-year with intensive needs and high levels of absenteeism. 
“One of our main priorities is creating a safe, welcoming and positive school culture that encourages attendance and drives students’ willingness to learn,” she wrote. She said they are in “close communication” with the local school districts and review the services that students receive each month. 
The Adelbrook Academy in Cromwell, which serves 80 students, mainly with autism spectrum disorder, appears to have done better than the others, providing more than 85% of services for motor skills and language and communication skills. But the auditors noted that the academy did not provide any record of the counseling services that were being offered through the school. 
Alyssa Goduti, president and CEO of Adelbrook, said that they don’t bill counseling services separately, since they consider them part of services every child receives. She said their data has since been updated.
In response to the audit report, the State Department of Education said they were “concerned” about the allegations but said it was the responsibility of the local school districts to make sure special education students were getting the appropriate services. 
The High Road School of Wallingford is one of four High Roads schools across the state. Last March, the four schools were the subject of a report from the Office of the Child Advocate and Disability Rights CT that revealed more than 1,200 reports of students being placed in restraints and seclusion within one year. Nearly half of those took place at the High Road School of Hartford Primary/Middle School. 
The report found that the students at High Roads were “grossly underserved both in terms of educational planning and service delivery.” 
“The investigation revealed widespread student disengagement and chronic absenteeism across High Road locations, failure to adequately assess and support students’ educational needs through individualized service delivery and, perhaps most alarmingly, gross deficiencies in the number of certified special education teachers and other credentialed educational staff working with children and systemic failure to ensure and/or document that staff had undergone employment checks and criminal and child welfare background checks,” the report stated. 
In September 2024, the Office of the Child Advocate and Disability Rights CT filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs claiming that the state Department of Education had failed to properly monitor what was happening in private special education schools. 
The Department of Education had said it  “vigorously disagree[d] with the conclusions” of the report and said they had not received any complaints about the school during the time period the report took place. The High Roads Schools said the report did “not accurately reflect the academic and behavioral supports at our schools” and that they had outlined their plans for improvements. 
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Connecticut Children’s Advocacy Center and the former Child Advocate, said she was concerned that the High Road’s report was a “canary in the coal mine” that indicated widespread problems of accountability within the industry. 
“You can’t have services and a system of care for highly vulnerable people that nobody oversees without bad things happening. And we do not learn that lesson despite being taught that over and over and over and over again,” Eagan said. 
Eagan said that while the local school district was responsible for making sure that a student was getting the special education services they were required to have by law, it was the state’s responsibility to oversee the districts. 
Matt Cerrone, director of communications for the state Department of Education, said the agency was reviewing the audit to determine next steps. In July, the state announced the hiring of an outside firm to review the agency’s system around special education and how it responds to complaints. 
Another concern Eagan raised was that certain schools were not conducting required background checks or hiring qualified teachers. She said one of the issues they found in the High Road report was a lack of credentialed staff and long-term uses of temporary substitutes. The High Roads spokesperson told CT Mirror that the school does background checks on hiring and that they have a department dedicated to hiring documentation.
The audit found that one school in particular, University School JPE in Bridgeport, did not show any evidence of background checks being done for any of the nine teachers that the auditors reviewed. 
The school responded that they had purchased the school from another company shortly before the 2023-24 school year commenced and that they kept the employees from the previous school. They said they had been unable to get anyone to conduct fingerprinting on their employees but that they had all been submitted to background checks in April 2024. 
“At the time of the audit, USJPE had been in operation for less than one year and had not had the opportunity to conduct recurrent background checks. Background checks are completed upon hire and recurrent background checks will occur April 1st for anyone employed for one or more years,” the school said. 
The auditors also raised concerns around the American School for the Deaf and the Grace S. Webb School for a lack of policies and internal controls around background checks for their employees. According to the auditors, four of six American School for the Deaf staff who were hired before July 2019 did not have a records of a national criminal history records check, and one of seven staff at the Grace S. Webb school hired before that date lacked the same record.
The American School for the Deaf said its current policy requires background checks for new employees and for any promotions. The Grace S. Webb School said they plan to implement a process to ensure that periodic background checks are conducted.  
“The Grace Webb School has long been a place of healing and learning for students who need specialized psychiatric support,” said Tina Varona, spokesperson for the Grace Webb School. “The students who attend the school face unique challenges that make it difficult to integrate into mainstream classrooms and are often unable to attend a traditional school.”
Jeff Bravin, the executive director of the American School for the Deaf, told CT Mirror that the school was using a new tracking system to make sure students were getting all their services and that they had created stricter protocols, including a new tracking system, that would confirm that “every staff member has undergone the necessary checks and verifications before beginning their work with students.”
“The safety and well-being of our students are the highest priorities at the American School for the Deaf. We take the audit’s findings very seriously and want to assure our community that we have already taken appropriate steps to address all issues raised,” Bravin told CT Mirror.
The schools, with the exception of Adelbrook. were also found to have various degrees of non-compliance with the requirement for employment history verification, and all the schools except the High Road school had multiple staff members without prior work references in their files. 
The auditors warned that a lack of background checks put students’ safety at risk and noted that not having employment verification history would increase the risk that one of their staff members might have been fired from or left a previous job, or had their credentials suspended because of “an allegation or substantiation of abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct.”
Goduti said that although Adelbrook was compliant with all background checks, they were implementing ways to conduct recurring background checks to maximize safety. 
“Ultimately, kids need to feel safe. Families need to feel safe when they’re sending their students to us. So that is something that we prioritize,” she said. 
In a review of teaching certifications, four of the eight teaching staff that the auditors reviewed at Wallingford’s High Road School were long-term substitutes not certified to teach special education. Two of the four teachers the auditors reviewed at the University School JPE did not have evidence of a certificate in education, and the school principal did not have a state certification in either education or administration.  
The High Road School responded that they followed state requirements around hiring, and that people hired temporarily without certification were given mentorship and professional development. The school noted that they continued to try and recruit for positions, but said a nationwide teacher shortage required them to have “flexibility.” 
The University School JPE said the two teachers without a certification had bachelors degrees in their respective fields, and that the principal had a master’s degree from Fordham, had taught at Sacred Heart and Fairfield University and had worked for the prior owners of the school since 1984. 
Data from the State Department of Education shows that staffing vacancies at approved private special education programs have decreased by about 400 over the last two years, but that there are still 2,500 vacancies at programs across the state. 
Goduti said that while Adelbrook wasn’t facing staffing challenges, she was well aware of the shortage of special education teachers. She said her school does internship programs and they travel to high schools and universities to promote special education as a choice for young people. 
“We need to figure out how to get more incredibly talented young people to want to go into special education as a career. It’s a hugely rewarding career. So we’ve been thinking creatively about how we can incentivize and really encourage folks to work in this field,” she said. 
Goduti said Adelbrook appreciated the auditors’ work and that they were always trying to improve. But she said the report also didn’t show the dedication of their teachers or their students’ successes. 
“ We serve kids that really have had a lot of doors close on them in their lives. We try to meet them with compassion and commitment and rebuild the sense of trust and help them to think about what are their dreams and how do they get there,” she said. “All those beautiful parts of our service system, which we gladly showed the auditors when they came to visit, it just doesn’t come out in an auditor’s report that only identifies deficiencies but not successes or best practices that maybe could be shared or highlighted.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0312_SR_HighRoads_005-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — President Donald Trump granted a disaster declaration for Kansas Friday in the wake of destructive June storms and after bipartisan support from lawmakers concerned with recovery efforts.
Severe storms landed in southeast and south-central Kansas on June 3, causing tornadoes, straight-line winds and flooding that lasted until June 7 and damaged farms, homes and power lines. Roads in some areas were impassable.
Kansas was eligible  for more than $7.5 million in federal assistance, and it now can be shared among Barber, Butler, Chase, Coffey, Cowley, Franklin, Greenwood, Harper, Hodgeman, Kingman, Lyon, Morris, Osage, Stanton, Sumner and Wallace counties, according to a news release from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“These federal funds will go a long way in supporting the restoration work by those in counties impacted by the storms,” Gov. Laura Kelly said in a Friday news release.
The storms damaged bridges, utility infrastructure and roads in multiple Kansas counties, according to the Kansas Adjutant General’s Department, which is responsible for multiple state agencies, including the division of emergency management.
“The declaration allows state and local levels of government, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations that provide vital and essential services, such as rural electric cooperatives, to apply for public assistance funds for emergency and permanent work for the repair or replacement of infrastructure damaged by the disaster,” the department said in a news release.
On Tuesday, Kelly proclaimed another state of disaster emergency due to heavy rains and flooding in counties in central Kansas.
“Heavy rains and flooding impacted several counties yesterday and we will do what we can to support those counties,” Kelly said. “Do not drive into standing water, just 12 inches of rushing (water) can carry away most cars. Turn around, don’t drown.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/femasignmiranda_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderIt’s the final countdown for Democrat Debra Shigley and Republican Jason Dickerson in their mission to represent a suburban Atlanta state Senate district.
Early voting begins Saturday in parts of Fulton and Cherokee counties ahead of the Sept. 23 election, when residents will select a successor for former state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican now serving as U.S. Treasurer.
Democrats are hoping to replace the MAGA stalwart with Shigley, a Milton mom, attorney and small business owner.
Shigley was the top vote-getter in last month’s special election, but the Republican vote was split six ways. Flipping the seat that Beach regularly won by wide margins will not be an easy feat, but Democrats are expressing confidence that frustration with GOP control of the state and federal government will help push Shigley over the top.
They’re pulling out all the stops, including an assist from Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is scheduled to help with Shigley’s weekend get-out-the-vote effort.
Dickerson, a Cherokee County investment manager, has been hitting the trail as well and touting endorsements from top Georgia Republicans like U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick of Suwanee.
Republicans are betting that Dickerson will consolidate the votes earned by other Republicans in last month’s race and stop Democrats from flipping the seat.
Early voting will take place Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling places will be open on election day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced a Jonesboro business executive as her latest appointment to Arkansas’ State Board of Education on Friday.
David Peacock, president of Hytrol Conveyor Company, replaces former board chair Sarah Moore, whose term expired at the end of June. Peacock’s term runs until 2032.
In a press release announcing her second 2025 education board pick, Sanders praised the Marine Corps veteran as “an incredible asset” and leader, who is “passionate about workforce readiness, literacy programs, and education freedom.”
“With leaders like David helping implement the reforms we’ve brought about over the past two-and-a-half years, I know our school system will only continue to improve,” Sanders said in the release.
Peacock said in the same release that he was “honored and humbled” by the selection, and that he looked forward to working with Sanders and the other board members to help students “succeed and thrive.” Peacock donated $250 to Sanders in 2021, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks money in politics.
“Education has opened countless doors in my own life, and it’s a privilege to now help create those same opportunities for children across Arkansas,” he said. “Partnering with parents and communities to prepare our students for the many paths ahead is both essential and inspiring.”
Peacock served in the Marines for over a decade, and worked for Rubbermaid, Textron, JLG Industries and Kalmar Industries before he joined the conveyor company in 2014. He holds a bachelor’s degree in history from The Citadel and a master’s degree in management from Webster University, according to the release.
With Peacock’s appointment, Sanders has selected a majority of the current board membership. She appointed Ken Bragg and Leigh Keener in 2023, Gary Arnold in 2024, and Aaron Abbott last month. Sanders will have an opportunity to appoint another member before the 2026 general election, as the term of the board’s current chair, Adrienne Woods, expires next summer.
Sanders also thanked Moore, a former elementary school teacher who holds a doctorate in education policy, “for her years of support and for her help in implementing” the LEARNS Act of 2023.
Moore was appointed in 2018 by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and previously served as Hutchinson’s education policy advisor from 2015 to 2017.
“Because of her hard work and dedication, the future for Arkansas’ students is brighter than ever,” Sanders said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-12 19:06:35+00:00,CT Mirror,"As government funding deadline nears, CT Dems seek leverage",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/12/ct-government-funding-deadline/,How would CT Democrats exert what leverage they have in a Republican Congress — and what would they accept in a spending deal?,"Congressional Democrats, including Connecticut lawmakers directly involved in the appropriations process, are assessing the best way to influence government funding legislation with a quickly approaching deadline.
During the last government funding fight in March, enough Democrats ultimately backed a GOP spending bill that didn’t include their input, a move that kept the government open and averted a shutdown but riled up a base that wanted the party to put up a fight amid the cancellation of federal funding.
At the time, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, who had voted against the GOP spending measure, called on his party to “change our tactics.” But six months later, the Connecticut senator insisted Democrats will employ a different strategy over government funding.
“Ultimately what happened in the spring was … a handful of [Senate] Democrats voted for a bill that was written totally and completely by Republicans,” Murphy said in an interview. “That’s not going to happen this fall. Democrats in the Senate aren’t going to vote for a bill that isn’t negotiated between Republicans and Democrats.”
But the bigger question confronting Democrats is how exactly they go about exerting the rare leverage they have in a Congress completely controlled by Republicans — and what they’d be willing to accept in a spending deal to keep operations going. 
With the looming threat of a shutdown, lawmakers are facing a deadline of Sept. 30. And Connecticut’s appropriators — both Murphy and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, are playing active roles in the debate over funding for fiscal year 2026. Both are pushing for bipartisan negotiations but underscored that a lack of Democratic priorities and the continuation of the Trump administration withholding funds are nonstarters.
Congress is eyeing a short-term deal that will buy them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package. That stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, keeps government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time.
Government funding fights have become increasingly thorny issues for Congress. But this latest cycle is further complicated by outside demands from the White House and an ongoing push to withhold funds already approved by Congress.
Republicans advanced an initial rescissions package this summer that cut billions of dollars in public broadcasting funds and foreign assistance. Now, the Trump administration is seeking to take back an additional $5 billion through a process called “pocket rescissions” that would circumvent Congress. A federal judge recently ruled that such a move is illegal.
White House budget director Russ Vought has indicated he wants to keep Democrats out of the appropriations process and have it be “less bipartisan.” But realistically, any funding legislation needs support from Democrats in order to pass. Republicans only need a simple majority in the House, but in the Senate, they need votes from at least seven Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance a bill.
Some Democratic appropriators like Murphy are wondering whether they can “trust” any funding agreements negotiated with the majority party because the administration could once again decide to circumvent Congress and its power of the purse.
“This president has either canceled or refused to spend over $400 billion, and that decision is both illegal and deeply harmful to our economy,” Murphy said. “We really risk writing a budget that’s not worth the paper it’s written on if the president decides he’s going to spend the money that he wants to spend and not spend the money in blue states or that are aligned with priorities that aren’t his.”
DeLauro, along with her fellow top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, released an updated tracker detailing how much the Trump administration has withheld in federal funding. The number has fluctuated as some funds have been released, but the most recent estimate is around $410 billion, including cuts in health, education and environmental grants.
How CT’s appropriators are navigating spending talks
While some White House officials are looking at more of a party-line strategy, appropriators are taking a more bipartisan approach.
DeLauro plays an even larger role as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. She’s been part of the committee for years, served as chairwoman when Democrats were in the majority in 2021 and has been the ranking member since Republicans took back the House.
She noted that the House and Senate have been on two different tracks and have spending bills with different topline numbers — the House is working with GOP-led legislation, while the Senate is pursuing bipartisan negotiations.
“We’ve made some progress here. I’ll continue to negotiate, but I will not support an agreement that doesn’t include Democratic priorities and doesn’t stop the stealing of funds through whatever procedural efforts the White House and [the Office of Management and Budget] wants,” DeLauro said in an interview.
“There’ll be tough negotiations, but I’ve been there before, and we ought to be able to come to a conclusion,” she added.
She indicated Thursday that talks between the Four Corners — the top Republicans and Democrats on the two appropriations committees — were heading in the right direction. DeLauro said they are “in sync” with a continuing resolution that would keep things for about a month or a little longer. Though that puts them at odds with the request from the White House for a months-long stopgap that runs through Jan. 31.
DeLauro was named to the conference committee that will include members from both parties as well as both chambers to negotiate and reconcile differences on three funding bills: Agriculture and Rural Development, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch. The plan would be to pass full-year funding for those three along with a stopgap bill to temporarily fund the rest of the government.
Meanwhile, Murphy is still working on a bipartisan bill as the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. But he said Wednesday that they have yet to reach a compromise. His subcommittee pushed back the markup of the DHS bill that was scheduled for earlier this week.
Murphy attributed the holdup to the way the Department of Homeland Security is repurposing funding approved by Congress to go toward stricter immigration enforcement and Trump’s deportation and detention agenda. But he still hopes they can compromise.
What Democrats hope to get
Lawmakers have a few more weeks to sort out the details, but so far, Democrats are playing hardball, raising the prospects of a shutdown. But it’s also not immediately clear what their final conditions will be to win their support. 
“The Republicans have to come to meet with us in a true bipartisan negotiation to satisfy the American people’s needs on health care, or they won’t get our votes, plain and simple,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference this week. Schumer took a lot of flak in March for helping to get the GOP spending bill across the finish line. At the time, he argued a partial shutdown would have been a worse option than voting with Republicans.
Health care has emerged as one of their main priorities in a spending agreement. And more Democrats appear to be rallying around an Affordable Care Act subsidy, known as the enhanced premium tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of the year.
If Congress doesn’t extend it in some capacity, insurance premiums are expected to increase, and the loss of financial help could lead to some Americans losing coverage altogether. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
“Our entire health care system will be undermined by the failure to renew these premium tax credits,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said during a press conference at the state Capitol on Friday. “Health insurance and these premium tax credits are absolutely essential to lowering the cost of health care.”
Blumenthal has co-sponsored federal legislation that would make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent.
Nationally, if the subsidies sunset at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that more than 4 million people would lose health care over the next decade, citing the increases in out-of-pocket costs because of more costly premiums. 
Amid the changes in the federal health policy landscape and the expiring tax credits, the Connecticut Insurance Department this week approved double-digit rate increases for state-regulated health plans in 2026.
Murphy said he’d like to see an agreement that goes beyond extending those subsidies and seeks to roll back some of the cuts to Medicaid that’ll be implemented in the coming years through President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
“I see a health care disaster coming for Connecticut and the rest of the country later this year, and this budget has to abate that disaster,” Murphy said. “I’m not going to vote for a budget that isn’t real, and unless we put some provisions in this bill that make it harder for Trump to undermine the rule or law and ignore the spending in the bill, I don’t see how I can vote for it.”
Between some health care protections and commitments that the White House won’t redirect or cancel congressionally approved funds, Murphy thinks his vote is easy to get. “That’s a pretty minimalist set of demands, if you ask me.”
But those demands may not be met.
While the ACA subsidy extensions seemed to be on the table, Republican leadership recently indicated that it wouldn’t be a part of negotiations. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he wants a “clean” bill.
But Democrats haven’t been the only ones pushing for the renewal of those subsidies, especially with the political reality that many Americans would lose coverage or face higher premiums at the start of the midterm election year in 2026. Some Republicans have also been supportive of extending the tax credits, and a group in the House recently backed legislation before spending talks ramped up.
Without getting into the specifics of what could be at the negotiating table, DeLauro said health care will be a “broad” piece of what Democrats are seeking. And both Murphy and DeLauro would like to see commitments that Trump won’t interfere with the new rounds of federal funding they are trying to pass.
“There’ll be a broad discussion about health care. Health care is a cost of living issue. I’m not specifying this one or that one,” DeLauro said. “We need a broad conversation about what should be included and that’s what the Democratic leadership is going to be doing.”
New strategy?
Democrats have been saying for months they want to fight harder — something that their supporters have been clamoring for since their defeat in the November elections.
Frustration surfaced among Democrats in the House and Senate over their funding strategy months ago.
Both Murphy and Blumenthal voted with many of their Senate colleagues against the funding bill. Nearly every House Democrat, including every member of Connecticut’s delegation, also voted against the bill in the spring.
Plus, the risk of a shutdown looms large amid negotiations and the uncertainty of finding consensus. And Democrats and Republicans are already giving a preview of the inevitable blame game that would play out if funding lapses after Sept. 30.
Republicans say the ball is in Democrats’ court to accept a deal to keep things open. Democrats, meanwhile, argue the GOP controls Congress and the White House and it’s on them to find consensus.
“The ultimate question of whether there’s going to be a government shutdown at the end of the month is going to be up to congressional Democrats, and that’s just the way it is,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said.
There hasn’t been a government shutdown since the first Trump administration. It was a partial shutdown that started late December 2018 and lasted about a month into January 2019.
If there’s another one during Trump’s second term, Republicans would pay the price, Democrats say.
“I think we can come to a reasonable compromise here,” Murphy said, “And if the government shuts down, everybody in this country knows who runs the House, who runs the Senate and who runs the White House.”

However, […]","Secretary of State Diego Morales speaks at a Sept. 12, 2025 press conference at the Indiana Statehouse. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The Indiana Secretary of State’s Office said Friday that a Vigo County man is being investigated for allegedly voting without being a U.S. citizen. According to Secretary of State Diego Morales, the man —who has a Mexican passport — registered with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in 2018 and voted in six separate elections.
However, no charges have been filed and the office couldn’t release a name. Morales praised a recent law that added additional citizenship verification for certain voters, which he said allows election officials to scrutinize voter rolls.
“This case in Vigo County is proof that hard work is paying off; it is proof that noncitizens have voted in Indiana; and it is proof that our legislation is necessary and effective,” Morales said.
Under House Enrolled Act 1264, voters with registrations tied to temporary identification credentials from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles must meet additional proof of citizenship requirements, which includes an appeals process. 
Following the law, which was enacted in July, the BMV sent names with temporary credentials to the state’s election division. In a comparison with the state’s registered voters, the election division identified 1,611 names in 91 counties that needed to provide additional information.
Those counties then had the responsibility to follow-up. Once notified by the county, registered voters had 30 days to verify their citizenship. Morales’ team said they hadn’t heard from counties about the other 1,610 names submitted for additional verification and couldn’t confirm if any others had been checked. “A few” names had their citizenship verified directly by the office.

Upon receiving his notice from Vigo County, the man apparently responded by providing his Mexican passport and verbally confirmed that he wasn’t a citizen, according to the office’s legislative policy director, Kegan Prentice.
Prentice said providing the Mexican passport was “obvious” proof of the man’s non-American citizenship, though it is possible to have dual citizenship.
“… usually, at minimum, if they’re going to respond to this notice they’re not going to respond with proof of citizenship from another country,” Prentice said.
Vigo County referred the case to local law enforcement, who turned it over to the Indiana State Police. 
Morales said his office has additionally notified the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI. 
“Some critics said that these measures were not necessary; that noncitizens were not voting in Indiana,” said Morales. “… we are even facing a potential lawsuit over these requirements. But we now have concrete evidence that this is happening in Indiana.”
 Additional context

With the 2024 law, voting rights advocates worried that a naturalized citizen might miss the county’s letter about providing additional proof of citizenship and lose their voter registration. In April, several voting rights groups sent a “notice of violation” alleging that the new law runs afoul of the National Voter Registration Act.
Prentice rebuffed that criticism.
“Just because the registration is canceled, does not mean that individual can’t vote. There are plenty of failsafe mechanisms in Indiana. Individuals can always cast provisional ballots,” Prentice said.
Morales, a naturalized citizen who was born in Guatemala, said he would be “more than happy” to share his naturalization documents if he’d been flagged for additional scrutiny.

“I don’t think that this is a barrier. I think that we’re talking about transparency and I would have no problem — and I know many other naturalized citizens who would not have that problem — to show their proof of citizenship,” Morales said.
Groups of individuals who may have driver’s licenses, but aren’t citizens, include immigrants granted temporary protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy or Ukrainian refugees. 
Morales pointed to a similar effort to check citizenship in Iowa that identified 2,186 individuals. Of those, 277 were found to be noncitizens and 35 voted in 2024 elections. Of those, six have been charged as of June.
“That is why I’m thinking that this is the first case,” Morales said.
Morales also said the state had complied with an expansive DOJ data collection effort, providing names, addresses, driver’s licenses and partial Social Security numbers of registered Hoosier voters to federal authorities.
“If providing the Justice Department information can help Indiana with ensuring our voter list is accurate and up-to-date, we will do so. We will take all the help we can get,” Morales said. “I am proud to work with President (Donald) Trump and his administration to strengthen election integrity.”
Jerry Bonnet, the office’s chief legal counsel, said the Attorney General’s Office advised them that they were “required to provide that information.”
Other states found otherwise and have declined to share their voter lists. On Friday, Stateline reported that the DOJ is sharing that information with the Department of Homeland Security to identify noncitizens.
Morales vowed to continue his work to tamp down on noncitizen voting, which is rare.
“My biggest accomplishment so far as secretary of state is requesting proof of citizenship, and I’m always going to be working with President Trump and his administration and our general assembly here to make sure that only U.S. citizens are able to vote in Indiana,” he said.
In 2024, Indiana had 4.8 million registered voters and just under 3 million, or 62%, voted in that year’s general election. The Hoosier state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the country.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For nearly three years, prospective business owners have eagerly waited for the date they could join Rhode Island’s budding retail cannabis market. That day is now here.
At the start of the Cannabis Control Commission’s monthly meeting Friday afternoon, chairperson Kimbelry Ahern announced regulators are now accepting online applications for two dozen new retail licenses through late December.
Under the 2022 act that legalized recreational cannabis, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to retailers, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives.
Cannabis regulators open screening portal for social equity retail license applicants

The commission opened the initial screening process for social equity applicants on Aug. 29. Social equity applicants are defined as those who were adversely affected by the War on Drugs, including residents in census tracts of five Rhode Island municipalities identified as “disproportionately impacted” areas from past cannabis prohibition.
As of Friday, Rhode Island Cannabis Administrator Michelle Reddish said 89 prospective social equity applicants have already applied for screening. Certification is expected to be complete some time in November.
All recreational licenses will be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone.
Regulators will accept submissions through 4 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 29. Ahern said Commission and Cannabis Office staff will provide technical assistance resources guidance for prospective applicants.
“Today is a significant day for the commission and Rhode Island,” Ahern said. “This milestone represents the culmination of years of work and collaboration.”
It’s certainly been a slow road for the state to establish its recreational cannabis market. Over a year passed before the three-member commission was impaneled, which then needed to hire staff to draft proposals and conduct a review of rules adopted in other states.
That left sales to the state’s seven pre-existing medical dispensaries, which have been allowed to sell recreational cannabis under hybrid licenses.
Those seven stores sold a combined $118 million worth of cannabis products last year, according to state data. Through the end of August 2025, existing hybrid retailers have made nearly $80 million in sales.
Regulations were finally approved by the commission in April, taking effect in May.
The inaugural rules require applicants to first be screened to ensure they meet qualifications before being placed in a lottery held in each of six designated geographic zones.
All prospective retailers are required to pay an application fee of $7,500 and a yearly $30,000 licensing fee. But the application fee will be waived for the first year for approved social equity applicants — whose qualifications for the speciality license  through the end of September.

,DC,2025-09-12 19:01:40+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration sued for using Ghana as ‘end-run’ around deportation protections,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-sued-using-ghana-end-run-around-deportation-protections,,"WASHINGTON — A Friday lawsuit from a civil rights group accused the Trump administration of bypassing deportation restrictions on immigrants slated for removal by sending them to Ghana and having the West African nation deport them to their countries of origin, despite credible findings they could face harm there.The move violates not only the due process rights of immigrants, but circumvents deportation restrictions placed by immigration judges who determined those immigrants could not be returned to their home country, attorneys from the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, wrote in their suit. “Defendants know that they may not, consistent with U.S. immigration law, directly deport non-citizens to countries from which they have been granted fear-based protection,” according to the brief. “As an end-run around this prohibition, Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work.”The Department of Homeland Security and government of Ghana did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.  Ghana President John Dramani Mahama confirmed to Business Insider Africa this week that the country struck a deal with the U.S. to accept a group of 14 deportees and send some back to their countries of origin. The attorneys argued that immigration judges granted their five plaintiffs fear-based deportation protections to their home country under the Immigration Nationality Act and Convention Against Torture. They are asking U.S District Judge Tanya Chutkan to require the return of the plaintiffs to the U.S. Chutkan sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was appointed by former President Barack Obama. The plaintiffs are nationals of Nigeria and The Gambia.Third-country removalsA deportation protection, such as a ""withholding of removal,” doesn’t create blanket protections from removal. It requires the U.S. to find what is known as a third country that will accept the deportee. Certain other requirements do apply. The government must notify the deportee of the country of removal and give them a chance to object if they fear persecution there. The U.S. government must ensure that a third country that accepts a deportee won’t then conduct a removal to their home country, where U.S. immigration officials have found they could face harm.The suit says that none of the plaintiffs were notified they would be removed to Ghana and instead they were placed on a U.S. military plane and none were given a credible fear interview of being sent to the West African country. They were placed in straitjackets and remained on the plane for 16 hours, according to the suit. The plaintiffs are referred to by initials in court documents. One, referred to as K.S., “is hiding and fears for his life” in The Gambia.K.S. was granted protections under the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations treaty, because he is bisexual and fears returning to The Gambia where he could face harm, according to court records. The Ghanaian government deported him to The Gambia on Wednesday, according to the suit. Four others are detained in Ghana. They are referred to as D.A., T.L., I.O., and D.S in court documents. Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records. “The comments by U.S. officials on the plane on the way to Ghana, combined with news reports about Ghana’s involvement in a deal with the U.S. about repatriating non-citizens to their countries of origin in Africa, indicate that the U.S. is deporting people to Ghana with the intention that they be deported to their countries of origin,” according to the suit.",,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

The free three-day event, held from Sept. 16-18 at the Environmental Learning Center in south Jackson, was organized by HOPE Enterprise Corporation and Yancey Consulting. It will include presentations and support from other major financial institutions like Capital One, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.
The idea for the festival, HOPE CEO Bill Bynum said, was developed following the 2024 election as a way to empower people in communities across the Deep South.
“Last November, it was clear that we were at a very critical point in the country and that there were going to be changes in the economic policies going forward,” Bynum told Mississippi Today. “But we’d also seen over the years that we know what it takes to ensure that people in places like in the Delta, in the Alabama Black Belt, in south Jackson, in Central City in New Orleans could navigate these economic shifts, these political shifts, these crises.
“So we reached out to our investors, to our board, to our team here at HOPE and our allies and said, ‘It’s time to create a new paradigm where everyday people in the South have the tools they need to prosper,” Bynum continued. “Delta Fest is not just a forum, it’s not just a conference. We see it as a strategy, a vision.”
An opening ceremony will take place on Sept. 16 and will be hosted by comedian Rita Brent and feature musical performances by Benjamin Cone with members of the Mississippi Mass Choir and the Jackson State Sonic Boom Pep Band. Later, there will be a fireside chat with music executive and Jackson State University professor Cortez Bryant. 
The next two days are dedicated to sessions broken into three tracks: Ownership, Entrepreneurship and Community Infrastructure. One will feature Jackson Mayor John Horhn along with the mayors of Birmingham, Montgomery and Little Rock. They will be joined by other local and national leaders, policymakers, creatives and entrepreneurs to share ideas, resources and information.
Bynum said he expects that by the end of the festival, there will be “some clear direction, some clear tools that people can put to use to start to advance a prosperous economy.”
“This isn’t just ideas and platitudes, this is really around, ‘What can people pick up right now to do and build within their entrepreneurship, ownership and community infrastructure?’” said Lisa Yancey, the founder and president of Yancey Consulting. “Anything that we want to materialize, anything that we want to manifest isn’t outside of us. It is already within us … We just need to activate it.”

DPH officials believe exposures may have occurred between Sept. 2 and 11 at Georgia State University, Sweetgreen Restaurant in Atlanta and at youth soccer practices and games.
This case represents the seventh case of measles in Georgia this year, while other states have been dealing with larger outbreaks.
Last year, Georgia had six cases of measles. Before that, except for 2019 when there were 18 cases, Georgia has had little to no confirmed cases of measles for the last 15 years.
Measles symptoms appear within one to two weeks of exposure and can include high fever, runny nose and watery eyes before a rash of tiny red spots breaks out, usually starting at the head and spreading to the rest of the body.
The virus can lead to severe complications, especially for groups including young children and pregnant women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in five unvaccinated people who gets measles in the U.S. is hospitalized. About one child out of every thousand who gets measles will develop encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that can lead to intellectual disabilities.
Between one and three out of every thousand children who get measles will die from respiratory or neurologic complications, the CDC finds.
Measles is preventable with the MMR vaccine, which also protects against mumps and rubella, a routine vaccination recommended for all children. But health experts worry that growing vaccine skepticism could contribute to the spread of preventable diseases like measles.
In Georgia, 88.4% of incoming kindergarteners had gotten their MMR shots during the 2023-2024 school year, according to CDC data – that’s down from 94% 10 years prior and 99.6% in the 2009-2019 school year.

They gave advice to state Sen. Jason Bean, who was at the dais presiding over the Missouri Senate  (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A newly-gerrymandered congressional map and limits on voters’ ability to amend the state constitution cleared the Missouri Senate Friday, capping two weeks of contentious debate that drew national attention.
The changes to the initiative petition process will appear on the statewide ballot next year. 
The new map, designed to give Republicans control of seven of Missouri’s eight seats in Congress, now heads to Gov. Mike Kehoe for his signature. It may ultimately end up on next year’s ballot as well, with a group called People NOT Politicians Missouri announcing Friday that it will file a referendum with the secretary of state’s office to “put this deeply flawed map before Missouri voters.”
The legislature reconvened last week at the urging of President Donald Trump, who has demanded Republican-led states rework congressional districts so the party holds on to its slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm election. 
The White House started pressuring Missouri Republicans to get in on the act in July, and this week phoned in to the state Senate GOP caucus meeting. The initiative petition changes were added to the agenda by Kehoe, with Republicans arguing the current system makes it too easy to change the Missouri Constitution. 
The Missouri House passed both measures Tuesday. The Senate gave them final approval Friday morning 21-11 after moving to shut down a Democratic filibuster following four hours of debate. Republican Sens. Lincoln Hough of Springfield and Mike Moon of Ash Grove joined nine Democrats in opposition to the new maps and the initiative petition changes.
Democrats say both proposals as a power grab by the Republican supermajority and a Trump-inspired assault on democracy. And they’ve denounced changes to the Senate’s rules this week designed to undermine any possible opposition. 
“This is a cynical maneuver designed to put a thumb on the scale of democracy, to ensure predetermined outcome regardless of the will of the people,” said state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat. “It is a betrayal of our duty to represent the people, and not a political party.”
 Congressional map

Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. Cleaver represents the 5th DIstrict, which includes most of Kansas City and Jackson County. 
The 5th District, which has been represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, would be carved up, with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County, would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
The intended result is a map where Republicans hold seven of the state’s eight seats. 
Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The Missouri Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times. 
Democrats argue it is unconstitutional to draw another map before the next census is complete. 
The Missouri NAACP filed a lawsuit in Cole County arguing the governor’s decision to call a special session was unconstitutional. Cleaver has also promised to go to court to challenge the new map.
Republicans say critics are misreading the constitution and are confident the new map will survive any legal challenge. 
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, said Friday that the map undermines decades of work to reunite a community divided at Troost Avenue, the line separating Black and white sections of Kansas City when housing segregation was legal. 
The GOP-backed map, Nurrenbern noted, splits Kansas City down Troost once again.
“Somebody in D.C. sought to resurrect the Mason Dixon Line of Kansas City,” she said. “Somebody in D.C. decided to split the 4th and the 5th congressional districts down Troost.”
Moon, one of only a handful of Republicans who have publicly opposed the new map, expressed concern Friday about legislators not being allowed to have any input in the process. 
“I ask myself what President Trump would do if he were in this body,” Moon said, “and someone told him, ‘this is all you’re going to get, and you vote yes, sit down and shut up.’”
For those seeking to repeal the map through the referendum process, they must collect 100,000 signatures in 90 days to put the map on the November 2026 ballot. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
“This fight is not over,” Elsa Rainey, a spokeswoman for People NOT Politicians Missouri, said in an emailed statement. “Missouri voters — not politicians — will have the final say.”
If they collect enough signatures, the legislature would have to move the referendum election to another date. That’s because local election officials say congressional districts must be finalized by May 26 for ballots to be ready in time for the August primary. 
The last time the referendum process was successfully deployed was in 2018, when labor unions successfully repealed a right-to-work law. The Missouri AFL-CIO has signaled it is likely to assist in a referendum over the maps.
 Initiative Petition

Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot.
In recent years, Missourians have used the initiative petition process to legalize abortion and recreational marijuana use, as well expand Medicaid eligibility.
Republicans have fumed at the success of progressive ballot initiatives for years, arguing they are bankrolled by out-of-state special interests.
When the bill cleared the Missouri House, Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis said amending the state constitution has become too easy. Any changes, he said, should have “broad consensus across the state.”
The legislation approved Friday would require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by Missouri voters to attain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts in order to pass.
Based on last year’s election results, that change would mean as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure. The new requirements would only apply to citizen-led initiative petitions, not amendments placed on the ballot by the legislature.
“If you’re a politician in Jefferson City, you become more powerful after this passes,” sais state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat.
The question will go on the 2026 ballot and require a simple majority to approve.
Sam Licklider, a lobbyist for the Missouri Association of Realtors, told lawmakers this week that his organization will oppose the proposal on the ballot.
In 2010, the realtors raised $4.4 million to amend the Missouri Constitution to prohibit sales taxes on real estate transfers. That was followed in 2016 by a $5.6 million campaign to prevent lawmakers from extending the sales tax to services.
“We are well positioned,” Licklider said, “to ensure our arguments reach the public.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_bean1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Two federal agencies had to move 35 people from the Minnehaha County Jail in the run-up to a state-funded saturation patrol late last month in Sioux Falls.
Minnehaha County officials asked federal agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Marshals Service to transport the inmates, whom the county is paid to house, to other regional facilities to make space for a surge in local inmates.
“These troopers are very good at what they do,” said Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead, who had advance notice about the operation. “If 15 or 20 troopers show up, they’re going to make arrests.”
State corrects record: 78 people arrested during ‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ saturation patrol

The saturation patrol ran on three days leading into Labor Day weekend as part of “Operation Prairie Thunder.” The branded campaign is a two-part initiative from Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, meant to address crime in Sioux Falls — where some crimes have hit five-year lows — and help federal immigration agents detain people suspected of being in the U.S. without authorization.
The Rhoden administration has said the operations won’t impact the Highway Patrol’s budget, but the movement of inmates points to other costs associated with the campaign.
ICE agents moving inmates aren’t on the street enforcing immigration law, said Milstead. The county jail, meanwhile, lost the revenue it had earned by housing federal inmates, and the federal agencies incurred the expense of transporting them to other facilities.
The first of what are meant to be monthly saturation patrols over the next six months put 15 additional Sioux Falls-area state troopers on the city’s streets. 
On top of tickets for drunken driving and speeding, the troopers arrested 78 people on drug charges. Twenty-seven of them were booked at the Minnehaha County Jail and released on their own recognizance, but 51 stayed through the weekend to await a bond hearing with a judge.
Milstead said he supports the enforcement efforts, but that supporting it meant making room at the jail to brace for the impact.
“As another operation approaches, we’ll need to do the same thing,” he said.
Courts, public defenders also impacted
The court system also felt an impact. Two judges hear bond arguments and set release conditions for inmates in two separate courtrooms the afternoon after a typical weekend. The courthouse was closed the Friday before Labor Day and on the holiday, however. 
Between the extra days and the extra arrests, the courthouse needed to pull another judge into service in a third courtroom to manage the overflow.
It’s not the first time that’s happened, though, according to Second Judicial Circuit Court Administrator Karl Thoennes. The Tuesday after the holiday was “busy, heavy, but not unusual necessarily” after a four-day weekend in the state’s largest metro area.
Minnehaha County Public Defender Traci Smith said her office saw a “significant uptick” as a result of the operation. 
“Our concern is that these are typically non-violent, nuisance-type offenses and outstanding warrants,” Smith wrote. “Dedicating substantial attention to these cases diverts limited resources away from our ability to prioritize the most serious cases — those involving victims awaiting resolution and matters that directly impact public safety.”
Federal inmate movement
The movement of federal inmates was meant to insure there would be space for local inmates, who take priority over inmates from other jurisdictions. 
Sheriff Milstead said his jail asked ICE to move 16 of its detainees to other facilities, and for the U.S. Marshals to transfer 19. The federal agents had to drive some as far as Sisseton.
“They’re moving some of them 150, 200 miles away,” Milstead said.
‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ will assist with deportations and boost Sioux Falls law enforcement

Some of the transferred inmates will likely need to return to Sioux Falls, at least temporarily. That’s because the federal government has prisons, but it doesn’t have jails. 
People incarcerated as they await trial on federal charges typically stay in local jails, and the federal government pays a fee — $114 per day, per inmate in Minnehaha County — to house them. Jails also collect fees for housing ICE detainees before they’re transferred for appearances in regional immigration courtrooms.
The jail in Sioux Falls didn’t stop taking federal inmates after the transfer. Eight people were arrested on immigration violations during the saturation patrol and were booked at the jail, filling half the beds ICE detainees had left before the operation began.
ICE did not immediately respond to questions from South Dakota Searchlight about the situation.
Barry Lane, a public affairs specialist for the U.S. Marshals Service, said it’s not uncommon for federal inmates to be moved out of local jails to make space when things get busy. Transporting inmates, he said, is “one of the most expensive things we do.” 
Lane, who works in the Washington, D.C., area, said he wasn’t aware of any particular difficulties for marshals in South Dakota. 
“Whatever’s going on near you, it may or may not be unusual,” Lane said.
Locals would like to see permanent commitment
Milstead expects the “roller coaster” of jail movement to continue with Operation Prairie Thunder, but he’d like to see a more permanent response from the governor’s office.
He and Sioux Falls Police Chief Jon Thum have had conversations to that effect with Rhoden’s office since the first saturation patrol. Their hope is to embed a state trooper permanently in one of the area’s joint task forces. There are three: one for violent offenses, another for the service of felony warrants and another that targets drug trafficking.
Those task forces, he said, help explain why the city’s been able to hold the crime rate largely steady as the population has grown, and to see some offenses drop to five-year lows.

Thum said he appreciates the state helping out by patrolling the streets for the same reason he sees the task forces as important. His patrol officers frequently attend to calls for service and are less able to target traffic enforcement, like troopers do, or dive into long-term investigations, as the task forces do. 
“The day-to-day operations of the city tie up a lot of our resources,” Thum said. 
But Thum said the idea of welcoming a task force trooper, with specialized training in drug interdiction, may be more hopeful than pragmatic in the near term. 
Hiring officers has grown difficult statewide, the chief said. Thum’s department is authorized to have 302 officers. He has 294. The Highway Patrol, he said, “is dealing with the same thing we’re dealing with.”
“We’re perpetually playing catch up at this point,” Thum said. “Once agencies get to be a certain size, you’re just constantly in hiring mode.”
Steve Long, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said the Highway Patrol has a 12% vacancy rate at the moment, but there are trooper recruits heading soon to the state’s law enforcement academy. 
Long didn’t say how many troopers the state’s authorized to hire, but legislative documents offered in January put the figure at 201. At that time, there were 21 vacancies.
Josie Harms, spokeswoman for Rhoden’s office, said the administration is amenable to the idea of adding a trooper to a Sioux Falls task force. 
Harms confirmed that the governor’s office has been in discussions with Sioux Falls officials about it, and wrote that “it is certainly a possibility, though nothing has been finalized.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Office of Inspector General filed a formal ethics complaint Friday against former Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green — accusing her of ghost employment and misuse of state property. 
The investigation began months before her abrupt resignation last Friday.
The filing, which was signed by Inspector General Jared Prentice, accuses Green of violating multiple provisions of the state’s ethics code. 
It builds on a remediation agreement first reported this week by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, which prohibited Green from using state resources for political purposes and cautioned her against inappropriate conduct toward employees in her office.
The next step is a public meeting before the state ethics commission, where the inspector general will present evidence and Green will have an opportunity to respond. It’s up to the commissioners to decide whether the allegations constitute violations of Indiana’s ethics code and what sanctions should follow.
Green also could enter into a settlement agreement.
She did not immediately respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment Friday afternoon.
The inspector general also has a duty to refer any evidence of potential criminal activity to prosecutors, who would decide independently whether to pursue charges.
Ghost employment is a felony under Indiana law.
Allegations in the complaint
The complaint alleges she improperly involved state employees in her political campaign, used state property for personal and political purposes, required staff to perform personal errands on state time and retaliated against an employee who cooperated with investigators.
According to the complaint, Green directed two state employees to generate campaign content for her “Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green” Facebook page and instructed another staffer to proofread posts.
Investigators said those actions not only violated the state’s ban on political activity during official duties, but also amounted to ghost employment because the work was performed on state time.
Story continues below.
REDACTED Complaint - 2025-03-0077_Redacted
 
The inspector general further alleged that Green held a meeting with a political director from the National Republican Congressional Committee during working hours and used a state conference room for that meeting. 
The complaint states that Green also required two employees to retrieve her assigned state vehicle from Crown Point, Indiana — a personal task performed on state time that the OIG said also violated the ghost employment rule.
Separately, investigators pointed to Green’s use of her official title on her private “Battle-Proven Leadership” website, where she sells training seminars and a book.
By attaching her state position to those business ventures, the complaint argues, Green violated the state’s prohibition against misuse of state property. The inspector general also alleged she used her state vehicle, and instructed an employee to do the same, for personal errands.
The complaint further accuses Green of retaliation against an employee who cooperated with the OIG’s investigation. 
According to the filing, Green threatened one of her employees “with either demotion or termination” after learning the employee had provided information to the OIG. The complaint further asserts that Green “made derogatory comments” and called the employee “demeaning names” after the employee sat for an interview and responded to subsequent requests for information. 
State law prohibits retaliation against employees who participate in inspector general investigations.
Five different employees are named within the complaint. The Capital Chronicle has redacted the names from the document.
What comes next
The filing comes only days after the Indiana Capital Chronicle published a previously confidential remediation agreement Green signed with state officials in July. 
That document laid out restrictions for her continued employment, including an explicit ban on using state vehicles for political purposes, a directive not to ask employees to staff political events and a warning not to comment on employees’ appearances. 
The remediation agreement was intended to correct problems and allow Green to remain in office, while the inspector general continued its investigation.
Remediation document reveals ethics concerns before Indiana cabinet secretary resignation

Green ultimately resigned on Sept. 5 after serving less than nine months as Indiana’s first secretary of public safety.
The complaint was released one day after the Indiana State Ethics Commission held a closed-door meeting in Indianapolis. 
Commissioners met for less than 20 minutes in an executive session to consider a probable cause affidavit and “an individual’s alleged misconduct.” Green’s case was not listed on the public agenda, however, and commissioners declined to comment afterward. 
By law, complaints remain confidential until probable cause is established.
The process requires the commission to determine whether ethics violations occurred and, if so, what sanctions are appropriate. Penalties can include fines and even barring a person from future state employment, per state statute. 
Green’s resignation marked the first departure of a cabinet-level official in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Closing the North Carolina AFL-CIO convention on Friday, state Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs thanked union organizers for their support and pledged to fight for their rights.
“I want you to know that I will not back down from any fight to protect your rights and freedoms,” Riggs said. “I am committed to a North Carolina where workers are protected, freedoms are exercised, and families can thrive.”
On the conference’s first day Wednesday, Gov. Josh Stein made a similar promise to help create a North Carolina that supports working families. The second day of the gathering largely focused on the federal crackdown on government employees under the Trump administration and how labor leaders can take a stand.
The annual convention also saw a changing of the guard in the NC AFL-CIO, with MaryBe McMillan stepping down as union president after eight years in the role. Riggs swore in her successor, Braxton Winston II, a former Charlotte City Council member who was the 2024 Democratic nominee in the state labor commissioner race.
McMillan commended Riggs for remaining steadfast and fighting for the voting rights of North Carolinians amid the monthslong election challenge by her opponent, Judge Jefferson Griffin.
“She never gave up,” McMillan said. “She fought fiercely for voting rights and for justice, for all of us, for our democracy, and to make sure that all of us had a voice in that democracy.”

Riggs said she was grateful for McMillan’s 20 years of organizing in the state’s largest labor federation, adding that there remains much work to do to achieve fair conditions for workers.
“We are in a state where wages are too low and workers do not have adequate protections. We’re in a state where unions don’t have the ability to fully organize or advocate for our workers,” Riggs said. “But in this moment here, looking at what’s happened in the last year, I want to celebrate the progress that you have made for our state and our people. North Carolina is better because of the people in this room.”
She commended the growing number of unions in the state as well as skills trainings, paid internships, and organizing campaigns created by labor leaders in North Carolina, where unions have historically faced structural challenges. A right-to-work state, North Carolina is estimated to have the lowest union participation rate in the U.S., at 2.4%.
But the state’s unions have been important political forces, Riggs said. The NC AFL-CIO endorsed and mobilized to elect both Stein and Riggs, the most prominent elected leaders at this year’s convention. Riggs said she was inspired by the persistence embodied by labor activists in North Carolina as she fought to uphold her own win in the state courts.
“I want to thank you for your support, and I want to let you know that your example inspired an entire nation, because folks really needed to see what a fight looks like,” Riggs said. “And if they’d been following labor, they would have known labor’s been fighting all along. But in the moments after the November election, people needed to see a fighting spirit and they saw it here in North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9123981-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

Several hundred Boeing workers cheered Friday afternoon at the St. Louis Music Park in Maryland Heights after learning union members voted overwhelmingly to reject a new contract offered by the company. 
“It was jubilant for a minute,” said Boeing assembly mechanic Christy Williams, “and now we’re heading back to the strike line.”
About 3,200 Boeing workers who assemble advanced aircraft and weapons systems at the company’s facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill. have been on strike since Aug. 4.
Union members of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 voted Friday to reject Boeing’s modified five-year contract offer, choosing to remain on strike.
“Our members in St. Louis have once again shown that they will not settle for Boeing’s half-measures,” said IAM International President Brian Bryant in a prepared statement issued Friday. “Boeing must start listening to its employees and come back to the table with a meaningful offer that respects the sacrifices and skill of these workers.”
According to the union statement, Boeing’s modified offer didn’t include a sufficient signing bonus relative to what other Boeing workers have received or a raise in 401(k) benefits.  
Williams said the new offer wasn’t much different than the previous rejected offers and called it “insulting.”
“We need to be compensated,” Williams said. “They don’t think we’re intelligent enough to understand contractual agreements, but we’re good enough to build the best fighter jet in the world. It’s crazy to me.”
She said it didn’t address one of the most important issues of compensating longtime workers. It mostly benefits newer workers, she said, like Williams and her son who joined the company a few years ago.
“This contract works for me and my son,” she said, “but it doesn’t work for the people at the top of the scale. And if the people at top of scale don’t continue to go up a little bit, especially based on economics and economy and cost of living, then it’s eventually going to cut all of us off who are at lower scale.”
In a statement after the vote, Boeing said it was “disappointed” employees rejected what its touts as offering 45% average wage growth. 
“We’ve made clear the overall economic framework of our offer will not change, but we have consistently adjusted the offer based on employee and union feedback to better address their concerns,” the company said. “In the meantime, no further talks are scheduled. We will continue to execute our contingency plan, including hiring permanent replacement workers, as we maintain support for our customers.”
Williams said members aren’t too worried about the company’s threat to hire permanent replacements because there’s no one there to train them.
According to the union statement, the workers assemble and maintain things like the F-15 fighter jet, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies, adding that their work “plays a vital role in safeguarding national security and supporting U.S. and allied defense operations.”
“The message could not be clearer—our members expect Boeing to do better,” said IAM Midwest Territory General Vice President Sam Cicinelli. “They will not be brushed aside with small adjustments. Boeing needs to stop dragging its feet and negotiate an agreement that honors the contributions of its workforce.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2964-2-1024x812.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(Photo by Amelia Ferrell Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia Democratic lawmakers kicked off their statewide tour Thursday in Huntington, fielding questions from local residents concerned about paying their bills, their local schools and health insurance. 
A state employee raised a question about the financially-troubled Public Employees Insurance Agency, which wasn’t addressed during the most recent legislative session. “My fundamental question is, is my wife going to lose her health insurance?” he asked.
It was the first stop on West Virginia House Democrats “Kitchen Table Tour” that will take them around the increasingly red state this fall to talk with constituents ahead of the 2026 legislative session. The GOP supermajority in the Legislature ignored pressing issues, Democrats say, like the need for clean drinking water, child care options and skyrocketing utility costs. 
“We would like to focus on issues that West Virginians need us to focus on. There are a lot of things that are not getting done,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, who also serves as chair of the state Democratic Party. 
About 50 people attended the tour’s first stop at Huntington’s Kitchen. 
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, and Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, attended the event, along with Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, who is joining House Democrats for part of the tour. Other Democratic lawmakers will join at future stops.  
“West Virginia, unlike any other place probably in the union, we’re probably all more alike when it comes to these kitchen table issues,” Lewis said. “Everybody worried about their high-ass utility bill. Everybody worried about whether I can get a good job, whether your grandchildren aren’t going to be able to afford college … we’re fighting for you, and you have the opportunity to fight for yourself.”
The party is also hoping to recruit volunteers and candidates ahead of next year’s election. There are 11 Democratic members in the state Legislature, which is overwhelmingly GOP and holds a supermajority in both chambers. After years as a blue state, Republican voter registration is growing in the Trump-friendly state, and Democratic registrations now account for just 28% of West Virginia registered voters.
In the 2024 election, 50 House of Delegate and Senate races — almost all with Republican candidates — were uncontested. 
“We have done a lot with a little. We just need more,” Hornbuckle said. “We have been able to effectively slow down some things, and every once in a while stop that legislation, but we do desperately need more numbers.”

Education a big concern in Huntington 
WOWK news anchor Amanda Barren moderated the event, and it kicked off with a retired teacher immediately asking about the impact of the state’s school voucher program, The Hope Scholarship, on public education. The nearly $100 million program, established in 2021, gives families roughly $5,200 per student in taxpayer money to use for private schools, homeschooling and more. 
“Some people are just not going to turn that down, and they don’t understand the consequences of that,” Hornbuckle said. 
Cabell County Schools, which contains Huntington, has said students using the Hope Scholarship contributed to a $7.1 million funding decrease this year. Population decline was also a factor. 
Hornbuckle said he plans to introduce legislation next year that would require families using the Hope Scholarship to pay their public school if their child is going to participate in athletics or arts programs. 
“Since you pulled that money out, you’re not paying for the services right now,” he said. 
Pushkin emphasized there are limited guardrails on the program, and millions of dollars from the of Hope Scholarships were used at out-of-state schools and to purchase iPads, dance studio fees and more. 
House Democrats proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration this legislative session. 
With more families choosing homeschooling, a woman in the audience said she worried about children who were being homeschooled without oversight. “We don’t know if these kids are being put in a bad situation,” she said. 
Garcia responded that the Legislature still needs to work on adding guardrails to the state’s limited homeschool regulations, noting the 2018 death of 8-year-old Raylee Browning who was being homeschooled after teachers reported potential child abuse. Three adults are in prison for her death.
In 2024, a Boone County girl died from apparent starvation while being homeschooled.
No laws have been changed to tighten homeschool laws in cases of suspected child abuse despite attempts from House Democrats.
“It’s the simplest way to have a narrow exception, and we haven’t been able to pass that. That is crazy,” Garcia said. “That is one of the things that we’re fighting right now — to have more accountability for those kids, especially those who are in that vulnerable state.”
Other attendees raised questions about affordable housing, and one woman emotionally shared the challenge making ends meet while paying a mortgage. She worried about others who can’t find a safe and affordable place to live with children despite working.
“I know how close I am to poverty that I am, and I’m a nurse … I don’t know how [families] make it,” she said. “If you’re down, you cannot get up.”
There were also concerns about the state’s limited public transportation and massive shortage of child care spots. 
Democratic lawmakers took notes on people’s concerns, saying they’d like to learn more and explore potential future measures — especially bipartisan legislation — to address problems.
“Stay in communication, call us, email us … so that way we can strategize when we need to strategize,” Lewis said. “Ultimately, don’t be discouraged. Don’t be downtrodden. The power is with us.”
The dates for the rest of the tour are:

Morgantown on Sept. 30
Charleston on Oct. 7
Fairmont on Oct. 14
Wheeling on Oct. 16

Matt Meyer has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening support for the state’s volunteer firefighters and emergency responders, addressing declining ranks and rising emergency calls that threaten emergency response capacity.  This is critical to Delaware because we are unique. Delaware is the only U.S. state that relies on volunteer firefighters even in its capital city, Dover. Only Wilmington has a fully paid fire department. Without enough volunteers, response times could lengthen and communities could face serious safety risks.
Key Bills


House Bill 171 updates the Delaware Volunteerism Act, allowing high school students to earn one elective credit and fulfill community service requirements by volunteering with local fire departments. Schools must notify students of the option during course selection.


Senate Bill 28 provides a $7,000 funeral expense benefit for deceased members of volunteer fire companies, ladies’ auxiliaries, and volunteer ambulance or rescue companies. The benefit takes effect Oct. 1, 2025, and applies even if other state burial benefits are available.


Senate Bill 86 expands the Delaware Volunteer Fire Service Revolving Loan Fund, now permitting donations from individuals, charitable groups, and counties.


House Bill 124 increases the maximum fees the State Fire Marshal’s Office can charge to reflect rising service costs.


“Volunteer firefighters save lives every day,” Meyer said in a statement. “These bills are an investment in public safety, in teaching the next generation, and in the dedicated Delawareans who answer the call when we need them most.”
A Mounting Crisis
“Delaware’s volunteer fire stations are facing a serious recruitment and retention crisis and it’s has been building for more than a decade”, said Gordon Edwards III, Fire Chief of the Brandywine Hundred Fire Company No. 1 in North Wilmington, and a third-generation firefighter.    The challenge for Firefighters is changing:


Shrinking Volunteer Numbers: Enrollment at the Delaware State Fire School dropped from 408 in 2009 to just 189 in 2019, a decline of more than 50 percent.


Rising Emergency Calls: Over the past 30 years, emergency calls have tripled statewide, putting more pressure on fewer volunteers.


Changing Lifestyles: Younger generations juggle school, work, and social demands, leaving less time for unpaid service. Many newcomers assume fire services are fully paid, and traditional family legacies of firefighting are fading.


Economic Pressures: The rising cost of living makes it harder for people to commit time to volunteer roles that offer no financial compensation.


“Volunteering at your local fire station is more than fighting fires… it is the first step to helping protect the people in your community,” remarked Gordan. “We are looking for a wide variety of volunteers, not just firefighters. We have tasks for almost anyone, including helping to coordinate emergency responses, organizing community events and fundraisers, teaching fire safety at schools and community centers, and maintenance roles that will keep the equipment and vehicles ready for use.”















Editor’s Fact Box: How to Help Delaware’s Volunteer Firefighters
Volunteer Opportunities• Fire & Rescue Roles: Most Delaware fire companies train new volunteers for firefighting, EMS, or rescue operations.• Support Roles: Many stations also need administrative help, fundraising assistance, and event volunteers.
Where to Start• Visit the Delaware State Fire School website (statefireschool.delaware.gov) for training details and application links.• Contact your local fire company—most have online sign-up forms and monthly orientation nights.
Other Ways to Give• Make a tax-deductible donation to your local fire company or the Delaware Volunteer Fire Service Revolving Loan Fund.• Share their recruitment posts on social media to help spread the word.
Why It MattersDelaware relies on volunteer firefighters across nearly every community. Your time, skills, or financial support can help keep response times low and neighborhoods safe.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/R.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

Charles Ray Crawford, 59, is set to be executed Oct. 15 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, after multiple requests by the attorney general’s office. 
Eight justices joined the majority opinion to set the execution, concluding that Crawford has exhausted all state and federal legal remedies. Mississippi Supreme Court Justice T. Kenneth Griffis Jr. wrote the Friday opinion. Justice David Sullivan did not participate. 
Last fall, Crawford’s attorneys asked the court not to set an execution date because he hadn’t exhausted appeal efforts in federal court to challenge a rape conviction that is not tied to his death sentence. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up Crawford’s case. 
A similar delay occurred a decade ago, when the AG’s office asked the court to reset Crawford’s execution date, but that was denied because efforts to appeal his unrelated rape conviction were still pending. 
After each unsuccessful filing, the attorney general’s office asked the Mississippi Supreme Court to set Crawford’s execution date. 
On Friday, the court also denied Crawford’s third petition for post-conviction relief and a request for oral argument. It accepted the state’s motion to dismiss the petition. Seven justices concurred and Justice Leslie King concurred in result only. Again, Justice Sullivan did not participate. 
Crawford was convicted and sentenced to death in Lafayette County for the 1993 rape and murder of North Mississippi Community College student Kristy Ray.  
Days before he was set to go to trial on separate aggravated assault and rape charges, he kidnapped Ray from her parents’ Tippah County home, leaving ransom notes. Crawford took Ray to an abandoned barn where he stabbed her, and his DNA was found on her, indicating he sexually assaulted her, according to court records. 
Crawford told police he had blackouts and only remembered parts of the crime, but not killing Ray. Later he admitted “he must of killed her” and led police to Ray’s body, according to court records. 
At his 1994 trial he presented an insanity defense, including that he suffered from psychogenic amnesia – periods of time lapse without memory. Medical experts who provided rebuttal testimony said Crawford didn’t have psychogenic amnesia and didn’t show evidence of bipolar illness. 
The last person executed in Mississippi was Richard Jordan in June, previously the state’s oldest and longest serving person on death row.

The stories and memories of the place endure.,"This was a Friday night in 1978. Malcolm White, who planned to settle in New Orleans, was visiting Jackson. His Booneville buddy, the late Michael Rubenstein, then a popular Jackson TV sportscaster, suggested they dine at The Mayflower Cafe. And dine they did.
“The place was packed and there was a line waiting outside, and it seemed everyone knew everyone, and of course everyone knew Rube,” White remembers. “The fish was fantastic, the vibe even better. Everybody seemed to be smiling and laughing between bites. I looked a couple tables over and there sat Miss Eudora (Welty), herself, and of course she was having as much fun as everyone else. It just felt like home. It was definitely my kind of place. I had a similar experience at the old Cerami’s at the Reservoir the night before. But that night at The Mayflower I thought to myself, ‘Hmmmm, Jackson, this is a place I could live.’”
Forty-seven years later, White, who became Jackson’s arts and entertainment engine, has never left.

Rick Cleveland
I moved to Jackson a year later, taking a job at The Clarion Ledger with no plans to make Jackson a permanent home. I had similar experiences at The Mayflower. Back then, The Mayflower stayed open until hungry people quit coming in, often well after midnight. We would put the finishing touches to the sports section around midnight and head to the ’Flower for redfish, oysters or soft-shell crab and something cold to drink. Lots of times, we already had eaten the blue plate lunch there, too. Mr. Mike (Kountouris), the longtime owner and an unforgettable character, took care of us. Friday nights were like homecoming. I am not telling you The Mayflower kept me in Jackson all these years, but I am telling you it has been an integral part of my life. It has been for so many. And Friday nights remain like homecoming.
What brings this all to mind this week was The New York Times listing of America’s Top 50 restaurants of 2025. The Mayflower Cafe made the list, along with such nationally renowned restaurants as Emeril’s in New Orleans, Sunny’s Steak House in Miami, and several of the newest, hippest restaurants in food meccas such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
What sets The Mayflower apart on this week’s list: It opened its doors at the corner of Roach and Capitol 90 years ago. The next oldest restaurant of the Times’ Top 50 is Emeril’s, which opened in 1990. Clearly, The Mayflower endures. Indeed, Malcolm’s father and my dad were Mayflower regulars as far back as the early 1950s. Mississippi governors, political leaders, movers and shakers were regulars even before that. 
But it wasn’t so long ago we regulars feared The Mayflower’s days were numbered. Jerry Kountouris, Mr. Mike’s son who took over for him, was ready to retire and nobody in the Kountouris family wanted to continue the restaurant business. Jerry, who had somehow guided The Mayflower through the pandemic that closed so many restaurants across America, put the business up for sale. For the longest time there were no takers. On more than one occasion, Jerry confided he was ready to close the place.
Enter former Jackson Mayor Kane Ditto and business partner Mart Lamar, who bought the building and convinced Hunter Evans and Cody McCain, owners of the popular and award-winning Elvie’s in Belhaven (which made the same New York Times list in 2022), to run the restaurant. The “new” Mayflower, which kept so much of what made the old Mayflower so special, opened for business in August of 2024. It took all of a year for it to be named one of America’s top 50 restaurants.

Said Ditto, “I just thought it would be devastating for downtown Jackson, especially the west side, if The Mayflower closed. It would have been. I am just so happy we were able to keep it going, and I am happy for this recognition from The New York Times. It is richly deserved.”
It had to be a difficult balancing act for Evans, a James Beard Best Chef finalist, and McCain to decide what to keep of the old place and what to change. Perhaps the best move was to retain many of the people: wait staff, cooks, bussers and security. The menu has  remained much the same, from the delectable onion rings to Redfish Jane. So have the sauces. The prices are higher, yes, but surely you have been to the grocery store lately.
Says Evans, “The hardest part was I felt like I had to explain to the old guard that we were not trying to come in here and make it about us and change everything. Our main goal was to preserve the history and story of The Mayflower. We thought the best way to do that was to renovate the dining room with some necessary changes. We didn’t just show up with new ideas and say, ‘Forget the old Mayflower.’ I called old regulars, I asked them about the menu and what they ate, I went to the Department of History and Archives. We care a lot about The Mayflower, everyone who has made this a part of their lives and the significance of this restaurant to our community.” 
Was there added pressure because of the place’s rich history?

“There was a little pressure, for sure, but we also understood what it would take to usher The Mayflower into the next 100 years as well as thrive in our community,” Evans answered. “That is why this recognition is so rewarding. We were able to help share this story that started so long ago. We are a small part in the life of this restaurant but we were able to share the story of this institution to the world.”
There are welcome menu additions such as the feta-brined fried chicken and Trout Amelia. There’s now an oyster bar and a happy hour. Oh, and yes, you need not leave the restaurant to use the restrooms, which are shiny and new and clean. Maybe it was part of the charm of the old Mayflower that, when nature called, you went outside, around the side of the building and up a narrow, dreary stairway to perhaps the most spartan toilets imaginable. I will always remember what my wife said one time, returning from the ladies’ room: “If I ever decide to commit suicide, I know just the place.”
So many memories and stories: 

Of so many Mayflower nights with the late author and pal Willie Morris, who charmed everyone in the place and who almost always was the last customer to leave before they locked the doors behind him. When paying his tab, Willie once also wrote a check for $10,000 to my then 6-year-old son, and in the memo line he scribbled: “FOR BOOKS!” Willie usually ordered spaghetti, took it away in a to-go box and shared it with his cat, Spit McGee, sometime before dawn. To this day he remains the only person I ever knew to order spaghetti at The Mayflower.
Of sitting in a booth with my family when the then-Governor and his wife stopped by to chat. The governor went on and on, as politicians do, as we put our dinner on pause. Finally, he left. Said my 3-year-old daughter: “Just who does he think he is?” Out of the mouth of babes…
Of many lengthy lunches with the late Gov. William Winter who loved The Mayflower almost as much as he loved Mississippi. Every lunch was a history lesson. That’s where he told me about the Southeastern Conference’s first office being just down Roach Street on the 13th floor of the Standard Life Building. As a result of that lunch, a historic marker now marks the spot one block from the front door of The Mayflower.
And this from Sandra Stevens Burns on Facebook: “My late husband, Warren Burns, was missing, in an Alzheimer’s haze. He was found standing in front of his beloved Mayflower, having walked there from Woodland Hills. When asked how he found it, he grinned and said, ‘I could smell the rolls.’”

For years, I had a long-running bet with Mr. Mike, who always grumbled about the sad state of the old King Edward Hotel, a crumbling home for pigeons and vagrants, just down Capitol Street from The Mayflower. Mr. Mike bet me he would die before the King Edward was either torn down or refurbished. As I often told him, it was a bet he couldn’t win because if he won I couldn’t pay him. He won. Mr. Mike died in 2005. The King Edward reopened as a Hilton Garden Inn in 2009. Mr. Mike was right. He usually was.

Catherine Cortez Masto speaking with a Forest Service employee after the Davis Fire in Washoe County in 2024. (Cortez Masto Senate office photo)When Linda Wadleigh was a forestry major at Utah State University she came upon her first summer job as a firefighter, a role that led to a 30-year career in wildland fire management with the U.S. Forest Service.
After years in the field, she and a handful of other women firefighters decided to create a boot camp to recruit and prepare other women to become firefighters through hands-on training and classroom learning opportunities.
“I didn’t see many other women, and I just wanted them to have the same chance that I did, to see what a great career this is,” Wadleigh said.
The Women in Wildfire Boot Camp program was established in 2011 and continued for more than a decade before it was terminated in February because of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.
As part of Trump’s sweeping plan to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government, his administration has issued dozens of orders cutting support from government initiatives to promote more diversity.
At a July 10 Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, U.S. Forest Service Acting Chief Tom Schultz was asked to explain why the boot camp program was eliminated. He responded, “there are still ample opportunities for all firefighters to be trained without singling out solely women.”
About 84% of federal wildland firefighters are men, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The U.S. Forest Service boot camp was launched to bring new firefighters, especially women, into a field that has historically struggled with worker retention.
The boot camp provides a structured path to becoming a wildland firefighter, but graduates still need to apply and once hired all new recruits receive the same fire training and must meet the same physical standards. 
After the program’s success in Arizona and New Mexico it expanded into 14 national forests across several western states. It was also adopted by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. At the program’s height, it trained and recruited over 200 people a year.
“We’ve recruited hundreds of applicants, that’s a great number to work with. We don’t want to lose that when we have trouble filling all our jobs,” said Wadleigh, who hired firefighters in her position as a district ranger at the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona before retiring last year.
Those recruits went on to fight wildfires in surrounding states, including Nevada, as U.S. wildfires have grown more severe in recent years.
Linda Chappell, another firefighter who helped run boot camp’s, said she knew the program had legs by the third year when it started regularly receiving more applicants than available slots.
“Women don’t know they can have this job, or women are hesitant to jump in for an entire fire season. After getting them in for a week of training they knew if they loved it or didn’t,” Chappell said, who retired in 2021 as an intermountain regional fuels program manager.
Both women are working with several members of Congress to urge the Trump administration to reinstate the program, saying its elimination will exacerbate the shortage of federal firefighters.
The Forest Service has lost more than 1,400 fire-certified federal workers since February as part of the Trump administration’s work to reduce the size of government. The agency has also recently asked firefighters to work more hours amid the staffing cuts.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and six other senators on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee sent a letter to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior Friday requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp program and its immediate reinstatement. 
“Thousands of firings at land management agencies across the country have already left land managers understaffed for upcoming fire seasons. We are concerned the elimination of this program will exacerbate this issue,”  reads the letter.
The National Intraagency Fire Center reports the U.S. has experienced more than 48,000 wildfires that have burned through more than four million acres across dozens of states this year.
“Eliminating a successful outreach program such as the [Women in Wildfire Boot Camp] unnecessarily limits recruitment to a smaller pool of potential trainees when there is already a shortage of skilled and willing potential workers,” the letter continues.
Chappell, the firefighter who helped run boot camps, said she believes the program was caught up in a sweeping DEI ban without reason.
“We think it may be just an unintended consequence. We’re not convinced that’s what they intended when the executive order was signed. So let’s go ask, is that really what was intended?” Chappell said. 
However, announcements about the boot camp that are still online warn “any previously issued diversity, equity, inclusion or gender-related guidance on this webpage should be considered rescinded.”
The letter requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp was also signed by U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR.), and Angus King (I-Maine).",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GkqhUxZW0AAdq69-1-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(Photo: Lisa Sorg)The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission voted 10-5 Thursday to adopt a new definition of “wetlands.”
This change would mean the state “wetlands” definition aligns with the federal definition, which shifted in 2023 due to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency.
This decision meant the EPA’s authority to regulate wetlands became limited to those with a “continuous surface connection” to permanent navigable waters.
North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality has been applying the revised “wetlands” definition since a 2023 law took effect in June of that year.
The law modified the text’s definition to say, “wetlands classified as waters of the State are restricted to waters of the United States.” The modification follows the federal decision to recognize wetlands only as those that are connected to navigable waters.
Sue Homewood from the Division of Water Resources led the presentation on the “wetlands” definition.
“While we did a regulatory impact analysis, the baseline was the session law that is already in place. The Division has been implementing this session law since it was passed,” Homewood said.
As a result, the conclusion from the regulatory impact analysis was there is no change in adopting this rule from the session law.
Opponents to the rule amendment voiced concerns over the loss of wetland protection in North Carolina, Homewood told the commission. There were also worries about how the rule would impact flood resiliency and wildlife habitats.
Julie Youngman, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said many other states were deciding to adopt stronger wetland protections to fill the gap that was being left by the Sackett decision.
“It’s concerning that the General Assembly in North Carolina chose to do the opposite,” she said. “Rather than fill the gap left by Sackett, it created a bigger gap by declaring wetlands that were previously protected under North Carolina law.”
Environmentalists would like to see legislators consider legislation related to reimplementing preservation and conservation for isolated wetlands.
Wetlands can act like a sponge in times of heavy rain, absorbing stormwater that would otherwise rush downstream to flood communities.
Fewer protections for wetlands could impact the water filtration service that they naturally provide, meaning more pollutants could enter wildlife habitats and drinking sources. NC Newsline has previously reported that in North Carolina 2.5 million acres of isolated wetlands are vulnerable.
“We should focus on what’s important for North Carolina: that we’re spending a lot of investments in mitigation and flood resiliency, that these wetlands could help provide for that,” Homewood said.
One commissioner asked if there was an analysis on the impact of the resources that would no longer be covered following the change.
Homewood said the division has not conducted an analysis on the federal definition.
“It’s a moving target,” Homewood said.
EMC’s adoption next heads to the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings. An effective date would pend legislative review during the 2026 session, and the rule amendment requires approval from the EPA.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Croatan-wetlands-Lisa-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

The mother of a 2-year-old claimed as a dependent on a stranger’s tax return. Another woman who now locks and unlocks her EBT card every time she uses it. The man who claims his “time has been lost forever and cannot be recaptured.”
These are a few experiences cited by plaintiffs in a March 28 class action lawsuit against the architect and vendor of the state of Rhode Island’s online public benefits and health insurance marketplace portal, RIBridges. The system was hacked by cybercriminals in July 2024, exposing the personal information of an estimated 644,401 Rhode Islanders. The data breach went undetected and unpublicized until mid-December. The cybercriminal group Brain Cipher took credit for the breach and leaked the data online shortly before the new year.
Now the plaintiffs are one step closer to possible relief under a tentative agreement with defendant Deloitte.
Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island show the parties entered into mediation in June. Following an Aug. 19 mediation session, lawyers for both sides told the court on Aug. 25 that they’d reached an agreement “in principle” and would file a preliminary-approval motion within 45 days. Details, however, are slim as to what that settlement might look like. 
Peter Wasylyk, who serves as the plaintiffs’ local liaison on the multistate legal team representing the aggrieved, said in a phone call Thursday afternoon that “it’s only internally settled.”
“So at this point, unfortunately, there’s no information to give other than what was filed with the court,” Wasylyk said. “Once the final settlement is drafted, we’re going to file it with the court. I’m sure we’ll have a lot more to say once we get the final settlement.”
On Sept. 5, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose extended a stay on approval so that both parties can work out the final settlement on paper. The parties have until around Oct. 9 to file their draft agreement for court approval.
The tentative settlement intends to resolve the case Pannozzi v. Deloitte Consulting LLP, which merged a set of six interrelated lawsuits filed in response to the RIBridges data breach into one case.
RIBridges firewall worked. But forensic report says hundreds of alarms went unnoticed.

A small number of people who did not apply for benefits were also affected, as the federal government allows states one connection to national databases used to determine benefit eligibility, a pathway RIBridges fulfills in the Ocean State.
People affected by the breach — whose stolen data may have included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and health and banking information — were notified earlier this year and provided free credit monitoring. 
If the court approves the settlement, it’s likely a public claims site would go live so eligible people could apply for any possible compensation. Following that, a final court “fairness hearing” typically approves the settlement terms and payouts. 
Deloitte has already reimbursed the state $5 million for credit monitoring and other costs associated with the incident. Neither Deloitte nor the Rhode Island Department of Administration — which runs the RIBridges system through its technology office — responded to requests for comment.
A separate civil investigation by the office of Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is still ongoing, spokesperson Tim Rondeau said in an email Thursday.
Meanwhile, the state has in the final steps of securing a vendor, The Northland Highland Holding Company LLC, to “modernize” the RIBridges system, according to a procurement determination form posted online in July. The RIBridges architecture dates back to the late 2010s and, last year, the state started seeking a new vendor to build upon, but not replace, Deloitte’s existing system. The nearly $3.8 million contract would run from Jan. 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027, with four annual renewals possible after the existing contract period.

Deloitte points finger at Brain Cipher
The March 28 filing from the plaintiffs and their attorneys allege that Deloitte’s “lax data security policies” helped to create the conditions for the breach, and that “Plaintiffs and Class Members were injured and lost money or property, which would not have occurred but for the unfair and deceptive acts, practices, and omissions” it alleges by Deloitte.
“Deloitte was at all times fully aware of its obligation to protect the personal and financial data of consumers, including Plaintiffs and members of the Class,” the 71-page suit reads. “Deloitte was also aware of the significant repercussions if it failed to do so.”
In a 52-page memo filed on May 27 in support of Deloitte’s motion to dismiss the case, the defense argued that the multibillion-dollar consultancy actually had no duties to the plaintiffs or any consumers, but to the state alone.
The memo signed by one of Deloitte’s attorneys, Jeffrey S. Brenner of Providence firm Nixon Peabody LLP, argues that the suit does not “allege any facts establishing a direct relationship between Deloitte and Plaintiffs — either through contract, commerce, or otherwise.”   
“Indeed, Plaintiffs do not even allege that they were aware at any point prior to the RIBridges Incident that Deloitte had a role in the Rhode Island State-managed RIBridges system, much less that they had any direct relationship with Deloitte at any point whatsoever,” the memo reads. 
Brenner concluded that Brain Cipher was the true source of the plaintiffs’ woes, and that the cyber gang’s actions were “specifically designed to subvert and evade Deloitte’s operation of the RIBridges system.”
“Thus, even if Plaintiffs were able to establish that Deloitte breached a duty of care, Brain Cipher’s criminal cyber-attack severs the causal chain and renders any alleged negligence on the part of Deloitte too ‘remote’ to give rise to liability,” the attorneys wrote. 
Because Brain Cipher was the ultimate source of injury, the attorneys argued, Deloitte could not be held accountable for the impact alleged by the plaintiffs. The defense was not too impressed by the extent of that impact either, writing that the complaint offered “no specific facts tying their alleged injuries to the RIBridges Incident.” 
In the case of one plaintiff who testified in court documents that he had lost irretrievable time dealing with the breach’s after-effects, the defense wrote that the plaintiff “fails to include any specific allegations of how his lost time would have been spent — and expressly alleges that it may have been used for ‘recreation.’”
“Moreover,” the memo adds, “the theory that they were damaged as a result of the RIBridges Incident is facially inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ own admission that thousands of data breaches occur every year that could just as likely be the cause of the alleged injuries.”

,DC,2025-09-12 17:48:52+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Appeals ruling threatens routine care access for Medicaid enrollees at Planned Parenthood,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-ruling-threatens-routine-care-access-medicaid-enrollees-planned-parenthood,,"WASHINGTON — Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the country began telling Medicaid patients Friday that their routine health care appointments will no longer be covered as a federal court order takes effect. The change, which could remain in place for months, if not longer, will likely impact the hundreds of thousands of Medicaid enrollees who go to Planned Parenthood clinics for health care not related to abortion. “This decision is devastating to patients here in the state and across this country. And it is compounding what is an already broken and overstretched health care system,” said Shireen Ghorbani, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. “We know that cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated.”Dominique Lee, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, said there is no plan for other health care providers to absorb the Medicaid enrollees. “There's no one waiting in the wings to take care of our patients,” Lee said. “Planned Parenthood is the safety net.”Planned Parenthood has identified at least 200 clinics out of about 600 that could close if they cannot treat Medicaid patients and receive reimbursements from the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some people with disabilities.“We are working, you know, feverishly with our colleagues and teams to mitigate that number,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. “We have to remember 50% of Planned Parenthood patients use Medicaid for their health care insurance. And so that is a very meaningful impact to the health centers that also rely on reimbursement in the same way every other single health care provider relies on reimbursement for the services provided.” GOP law targets Planned ParenthoodFederal law for decades has barred funding from going toward abortion services with limited exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress included a provision in their “big, beautiful” law that prevents Medicaid funding from going to certain health care organizations that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in reimbursements from the program during a recent fiscal year. The language, which originally applied for 10 years but was reduced to one year in the final version of the bill, appeared to specifically target Planned Parenthood. It prevents the organization from receiving any Medicaid funding for health care services unrelated to abortion, like annual physicals, cancer screenings and STI testing.Planned Parenthood quickly filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in Massachusetts in July, shortly after President Donald Trump signed the legislation.  A district court judge issued a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction that month, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing that one aspect of the law and allowing Medicaid patients to continue going to Planned Parenthood for routine health care services.On Thursday, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s ruling, clearing the way for the Trump administration to stop reimbursing Planned Parenthood for Medicaid patients while the case continues. Peyton Humphreville, senior staff attorney at Planned Parenthood Federation of America and one of the lawyers handling the lawsuit, said on a call with reporters Friday the organization is evaluating all of its options but doesn’t expect additional rulings until later this year at the earliest. “The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals has entered a briefing schedule on the preliminary injunction appeal that will be fully briefed by mid-November,” Humphreville said. “From there, the court will schedule oral argument and will at some point after the oral argument rule on the preliminary injunction appeal.”",,,,2025-09-12 13:56:56.277236

“The next phase will include a comprehensive mission with the Tennessee National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tennessee Highway Patrol, Memphis Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies, and we are working closely with the Trump Administration to determine the most effective role for each of these agencies to best serve Memphians,” Lee said in a statement released Friday afternoon.
Lee added he plans to speak with President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon to “work out details of the mission.”
Trump told Fox News that he plans to send federal troops into Memphis, after weeks of speculation and calls from state Republican officials for him to do so.

Trump said the Shelby County city was a “deeply troubled” and that the city’s Democratic mayor and Republican governor “were happy” for him to send in national guard troops like he did in Washington D.C.
The announcement comes days after Memphis Mayor Paul Young confirmed in a statement to MLK50, a Memphis nonprofit news outlet, that his office, Gov. Bill Lee’s and the Trump administration were considering sending troops to Tennessee’s most populous city. 
Young did not respond to a request for comment by the Lookout, but told MLK50 he was “committed to working to ensure any efforts strengthen our community and build on our progress.”
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said in a statement to the Lookout that Trump’s decision to send troops was “disappointing and anti-Democratic.”
“The president sending troops to Tennessee will interfere and have a chilling effect on Tennesseans’ ability to exercise critical freedoms, such as the freedom to protest and the liberty to travel,” Harris said. “We will do everything in our power to prevent this incursion.”
Two weeks ago, Gov. Bill Lee told reporters Memphis crime had dropped by 15% in the last year and that he had no plans to deploy the Tennessee National Guard to the city, only to reverse course a week later, saying that anything was possible. 










This is an abuse of power, using troops to score political points off of crime statistics, even though overall crime in Memphis is down to a 25-year low.


– Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis


A federal appeals court ruled that Trump’s decision to take over the National Guard and send troops into Los Angeles without the California governor’s permission was illegal. His administration is appealing the ruling. 
Trump also said he planned to deploy troops to Chicago but later backtracked. In Washington D.C., the president has more direct control of the presence of federal troops because the federal government reserves significant authority over governance of the city, which was established as a federal enclave separate from any of the states.
Tennessee’s state law says the governor can deploy the National Guard in an “invasion, disaster, insurrection, riot, attack, or combination to oppose the enforcement of the law by force and violence.” But the deployment can not exceed the extent of the emergency.
Stockard on the Stump: Tennessee House speaker wants “strike force” to hit Memphis gangs

“This is an abuse of power, using troops to score political points off of crime statistics, even though overall crime in Memphis is down to a 25-year low,” said Senate Minority Leader Raumesh Akbari, a Memphis Democrat. “That’s not leadership — that’s overreach.
The Lookout previously reported that Tennessee Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton favored sending federal and state troops to Memphis as a “strike force” to cut down on gang activity.
Rep. John Gillepsie, a Memphis Republican, said on social media he was “grateful” for the decision and that “arrests must be backed by tough prosecution and accountability in the courts.”
The last time the Tennessee National Guard was deployed to Memphis was in 1978, when a strike by city firefighters resulted in more than 100 fires throughout the city in a matter of days. Then-Mayor Wyeth Chandler declared a civil emergency, calling for a military presence and curfews for residents.
This is a developing story.

In January, New Mexico environment officials cited the base for a spill of wastewater containing firefighting foam with PFAS which soaked into the aquifer after a retaining pond leaked. (U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Alex Mercer)In mid-July, Neil Dolly left Albuquerque near dawn and headed to Clovis. Under the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act, he and his co-workers with the New Mexico Environment Department have the authority to conduct surprise inspections of hazardous waste sites, take samples and shoot photos. 
Parked at a gas station near Cannon Air Force Base, Dolly called the base to confirm names and email addresses. About 30 minutes later, he emailed officials to say he was arriving. 
Once inside, base officials and attorneys told Dolly and his assistant they wouldn’t be allowed to collect soil and water samples to test for PFAS. According to Dolly, they cited ongoing litigation between the state and the Pentagon.
No one paying attention to New Mexico’s PFAS saga should be surprised that the military kept Dolly from doing his job. But we should all stay alert to how the U.S. government thwarts the ability — indeed, the right — of states to protect their lands, waters and people. 
Patented in the 1940s, PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances have been used since then in cookware, clothing, food wrappers, furniture and firefighting foams. The same qualities that make them useful — water and sunlight don’t destroy their molecules of joined carbon and fluorine atoms — also make them hard to clean up. Instead of breaking down over time, they move up the food chain, persisting in soils and waters and accumulating in the bodies of animals and humans. Some people refer to this toxic family as “forever chemicals.”
In 2018, the Air Force notified New Mexico officials that tests at Cannon — and Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo — detected perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Firefighting foams the military started using in the 1970s had contaminated groundwater with PFOA and PFOS, just two of the thousands of compounds in the PFAS family.  
When New Mexico called for cleanup, the U.S. Department of Defense sued, challenging the state’s authority. Currently, the state is part of a multi-district federal lawsuit seeking past and future clean-up costs and all natural resource damages at Cannon Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and Fort Wingate. And in June, the state filed another lawsuit, ordering the Pentagon to clean up the plume at Cannon under a new law that clarifies the state’s ability to regulate hazardous PFAS, even if the federal government has neglected to set standards for the chemicals. 
By now, the contaminated plume is roughly six miles long, and New Mexicans have spent about $12 million on litigation. We’ve spent millions more testing well water and residents’ blood and connecting rural Curry County residents to a public water system because they can’t safely drink their well water.
“I spend a lot of time battling the PFAS monster that is just omnipresent every day with some new filing or some new denial of access or whatever it is,” NMED Secretary James Kenney told me in an interview. “There is no single more recalcitrant polluter, that is more litigious, than the Department of Defense.” 
Kenney says he’s frustrated that the Pentagon keeps trampling the rights of states like New Mexico that are grappling with PFAS contamination. “Where is this notion of cooperative federalism, that states rights are supreme when implementing federal law?” he asks. “I feel like the Department of Defense is giving the middle finger salute to Congress, and they’re OK with it.”
Meanwhile, the toxic chemicals have traveled beyond Cannon into the Ogallala Aquifer, and into the blood of people working on and living near the base. A few years ago, Art Schaap, whose dairy farm overlooks Cannon, euthanized 3,500 cows because their blood — and milk — was poisoned. 
More recently, the state released test results for 628 people who worked on or lived near Cannon, all but two of whom had at least one type of PFAS in their blood, and more than 90% of whom tested positive for multiple types of the toxic chemicals. 
PFAS’ threat to human health is well known. 
Beginning in the 1960s, manufacturers like 3M and DuPont knew from testing workers and nearby water supplies that different PFAS chemicals caused reproductive and development problems; birth defects; liver and kidney disease; and immune system problems. Additional studies have linked exposure to high cholesterol, low infant birth weights, and certain cancers, along with thyroid and hormone disruption.
As a longtime environment reporter, I have witnessed generations of state officials try to protect public health and rein in legacy pollution from federal installations. Despite the massive amount of money American taxpayers invest in the Pentagon — more than a trillion dollars this year alone — the federal government continues to punt on cleanup and put people, and our precious waters, at risk. 
At Kirtland Air Force Base, for example, 24 million gallons of jet fuel leaked into the aquifer — and still hasn’t been cleaned up. Los Alamos National Laboratory has long polluted tributaries of the Rio Grande, and few people want to consider what lies in the sediment at the bottom of Cochiti Lake. At White Sands Test Facility, the U.S. Army and NASA have contaminated groundwater with multiple pollutants. Confirmed PFAS contamination also has been established at Fort Wingate Depot, the Santa Fe Army Aviation Support Facility, the Army National Guard’s Roswell Field Maintenance Shop and White Sands Missile Range. 
New Mexico will become increasingly arid, and our water challenges will only get tougher. We can all see the parched forests and fields, shallow reservoirs and drying riverbeds. We should also be clear-eyed about the legacy of federal pollution, and what all that contaminated water means for the state’s future. That is water lost to farms, families and the future. And the recently renamed U.S. Department of War isn’t likely to prioritize cleanup anytime soon.
As the federal government openly challenges — or just ignores — the authority of states to protect their own lands, waters and people, New Mexicans can’t be kept in the dark about what we face from legacy or emerging pollutants. And New Mexicans on opposite sides of the political aisle should at least align with one another to protect the state’s waters. No matter what else is happening in the country, our water future here in New Mexico depends on transparency and unity.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pfasphoto.jpg,,,2025-09-12 13:56:56.277236

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A study by Iowa State University researchers shows the viability of using bio-oils to plug abandoned oil wells, an application that could drive economic growth for Iowans with farm and forest waste.
ISU mechanical engineering professor Mark Mba-Wright led a “techno-economic assessment” of technology that uses oil created from plant waste to fill orphan oil wells, or abandoned wells that need to be filled in, and sequester carbon dioxide.
Mba-Wright, who has studied bio-oils and its applications for more than a decade, said he was surprised to learn about this use of the materials when the carbon removal company Charm Industrial reached out about conducting the study. The fossil fuel and biofuel industries aren’t usually mentioned in connection with one another, he said.
“We’ve collaborated before, but this was certainly a novel application that we hadn’t considered before,” Mba-Wright said.

Bio-oils are created through a process called pyrolysis, Mba-Wright said, where plant debris is burned quickly at very high temperatures, producing both oil and biochar, a solid byproduct. Bio-oils are most commonly blended with crude oil to make cleaner gasoline and diesel. But recently, Mba-Wright said researchers have started looking to include bio-oils in chemical cement mixtures.
Charm Industrial has already started using bio-oils to fill wells, Mba-Wright said, but reached out to the ISU professor to analyze the prospects of creating mobile units the would gather and process biomass, then transport the oil to a central hub before it is injected into a well. The mobile pyrolysis units would be around the size of a combine and sit behind farm equipment to collect leftovers from harvest.
“They have units in operation and contracts in place, but they wanted to understand what is the long-term potential of making these on-site, small-scale pyrolysis units,” Mba-Wright said. “And so we have process models and financial models that can evaluate some of the configurations that we’re interested in.”
A proposed plan included in the study would involve at least 200 mobile units, according to the report, each with a processing capacity of 10 tons a day. At that capacity and with the units using debris from corn harvests, also known as corn stover, the study stated 5.3 tons of bio-oil and 2.5 tons of biochar would be created per day.
These units would cost between $1-$2 million to build, Mba-Wright said, and the study stated bio-oil would need to reach a minimum base selling price of at least $175 per ton. Capital costs would decrease over time as more units are made, according to the study, and the plan stacks up in terms of cost and productivity against other methods of carbon sequestration, like direct air capture.
The study stated there were more than 123,000 documented orphaned oil and gas wells in the U.S., but there could be between 310,000 and 800,000 undocumented wells that have been abandoned.
“Iowa State’s experts showed that bio-oil sequestration using corn stover can deliver a high-value, durable carbon removal product that outcompetes other technologies, while providing new markets for crop residues and delivering new economic value to the rural economy,” said Charm Industrial co-founder and CEO Peter Reinhardt in an ISU news release. “As the carbon-removal sector grows, Charm is grateful to work with farm and forest communities to grow this opportunity.”
Mba-Wright said the research team and company are having “ongoing conversations” about further research into pyrolysis and bio-oil through the ISU Bioeconomy Institute, a university center focused on using biomass and other renewable resources for economic and social development.
In addition to trapping carbon that would have otherwise entered the atmosphere and plugging oil wells — which also leak emissions and can pose safety hazards — Mba-Wright said this use of biowaste could bring revenue and opportunities for new practices to Iowa farmers.
Corn stover is generally left to decay in the field, but Mba-Wright said farmers could earn money by letting the debris get picked up and turned into bio-oil. The biochar byproduct created through pyrolysis could go back to the farmer to be mixed in their soil. Mba-Wright said this could lower fertilizer costs and increase land values, but he said the team did not focus on these avenues in their recent work.
“It certainly adds value to a resource that’s underutilized in most fields,” Mba-Wright said.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Mainers will be able to access COVID vaccines without a prescription, according to new guidance issued by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention under Gov. Janet Mills’ direction.
This fall, the Food and Drug Administration only approved the shots for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID, including seniors at least 65 years old or those who have health conditions. 
That means COVID vaccines aren’t broadly available to anyone ages 6 months and older anymore, which has been enforced in other states. 
Some national pharmacies, such as CVS, previously said they would only administer COVID-19 vaccines to people in Maine with prescriptions from their doctors, according to the Portland Press Herald. 
But the new order from Mills “serves as a prescription for all Maine people,” allowing them to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at pharmacies, clinics, and health care offices across the state without a prescription from their health care provider, according to an announcement from herMills’ office Friday afternoon. 
“I will not stand idly by while the Trump Administration makes it harder for Maine people to get a vaccine that protects their health and could very well save their life,” Mills said in a statement. “Through this standing order, we are stepping up to knock down the barriers the Trump Administration is putting in the way of the health and welfare of Maine people.”
The Maine Bureau of Insurance will also ensure that health insurance companies provide full coverage for COVID-19 vaccines without any cost sharing or prior authorization. MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, also covers COVID-19 vaccinations.
The availability of vaccines still remains under question despite the order. When Caitlin Gilmet, director for Maine Families for Vaccines and communications director for American Families for Vaccines, made an appointment last month for her family, including school-age children, to get the COVID vaccine this month, they received a notification that they needed to wait until the state was able to ensure that we’re able to get these vaccines.
“I’m super enthusiastic, both as a parent and a pro-vaccine advocate, to know that the governor’s office and Maine CDC acted so quickly to defend access to covid vaccines, especially with respiratory virus season starting and kids heading back to school,” she said.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration health officials have argued that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don’t necessarily need annual boosters anymore. But according to guidance from several national medical and public health organizations, including the Maine CDC,  “vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe COVID-19.”

I’m pretty big on Jesus. I’m also pretty uncomfortable with the message on that T-shirt. I’ve seen it before. It has been a focus by a group of pastors in Rapid City for several years.
When I got home from mass, I Googled “This city belongs …” and my computer quickly filled in the “to Jesus” and led me to a page (thiscitybelongstojesus.com) listing past and upcoming rallies here in Rapid City committed to dedicating the city to Jesus.
There is also a “This City Belongs to Jesus” Facebook page, with an introduction that reads: “This page is dedicated to the church of Rapid City coming together under the name of Jesus.”

Now, I hate to state the obvious, but Rapid City is, as its name suggests, a city, not a church. It shouldn’t be seen as a church. It shouldn’t be managed like a church. It is a community of people with different beliefs — including those on religion — and a framework of businesses and services and government to support and hopefully benefit all of us.
As a city, not a church.
Christianity is certainly the dominant religion here in Rapid City, as it is throughout South Dakota. But we Christians don’t represent everyone. And we shouldn’t try to impose our religious views on everyone, or anyone.
Nor should a mayor who happens to also have worked as a Christian minister act as a minister first and a mayor second. I’m not saying our current mayor does that. I bring him up only because before he was mayor, Jason Salamun was executive pastor at Fountain Springs Church. Sometimes he still sounds like a pastor, which is OK, up to a point.
It’s fine for government officials to be informed by their religious beliefs. It’s not fine at all when they try to impose them on others.
I love the idea of Christ being central to our lives. I certainly try to make him central to mine. But not everybody does. Not everybody believes what I believe, or what Salamun believes.
That’s why it’s so important to keep some space between religion and government. And it’s why I worry when religious leaders start talking about “the church of Rapid City” and the city belonging to Jesus.
When I saw the woman’s T-shirt the other day, I had to wonder: “OK, but what about Jews? What about Muslims? What about Hindus? What about Buddhists? What about Wiccans? (Yes, there are Wiccans here). What about agnostics and atheists?”
And, especially, given where we live, what about Indigenous people? Of course, many are Christian. But many others practice their own Native American spirituality, worshipping a creator who has nothing to do with Jesus. Imagine how they might feel when they see people wearing the “This City Belongs to Jesus” T-shirt.
Rapid City belongs to all of us residents, of course. It belongs to the rule of law, the state Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.
Christians or not, we are all citizens of the same city, with the same rights and challenges and the same hopes and dreams for ourselves and our families. And we can all call this city our own.
This is a city issue that is also a state issue and a national issue. The promoters of Christian nationalism seek a dangerous convergence of government and religion. Christian religion, of course.
But this is a nation where our many freedoms are intended to include protection for those with different religious beliefs — or none at all — from a potentially oppressive religious majority.
We have seen what happens in other countries where religion and government become one. We should never want that here.
So when it comes to message T-shirts, I’d much prefer one that reads: “My heart belongs to Jesus, but my city belongs to everyone.”
That one I’d wear.

Proposition, or “prop,” betting is legal in Connecticut, but it is tightly regulated, especially when college sports are involved. 
Prop bets let people wager on specific in-game events, such as which team scores first, rather than simply who wins.
Connecticut authorized sports wagering in 2021. The Department of Consumer Protection allows prop betting on professional sports and most college games, but there are restrictions for in-state college teams such as UConn or Yale. Bettors cannot place prop wagers on individual Connecticut college athletes and cannot bet on single games involving in-state colleges. The only exception is for approved intercollegiate tournaments with at least four teams, and even then bets must cover the overall tournament outcome, not individual games.
Connecticut law also bans novelty prop bets, including wagers on the Super Bowl coin toss, halftime show, or similar entertainment outcomes, regardless of the event’s location.

Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star.A progressive coalition of 20 Maine organizations opposed the nomination of a federal judge from Maine to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, citing his opposition of reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights, and history of defending large corporations.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination of Portland-based lawyer Joshua Dunlap to the Boston-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which covers Maine. Republican Sen. Susan Collins supported the nomination, saying Dunlap’s “professionalism and experience … make him an excellent choice for the First Circuit.” That court is the only one of the 13 federal appeals courts with no current judges appointed by Republican presidents.
On Friday, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England joined Equality Maine, Maine Women’s Lobby and Our Power Maine in urging Collins to vote against Dunlap, citing his anti-reproductive rights and anti-LGBTQ+ stances, including public opposition to marriage equality and support for fetal personhood. They criticized his record of consistently siding with large corporations over the interests of Maine residents and his affiliation with the Alliance Defending Freedom, designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Dunlap is currently a partner in the Portland law firm Pierce Atwood, and co-chairs its Appellate & Amici team. Two decades ago, Dunlap interned for the Alliance Defending Freedom, and when asked about it in a judiciary committee hearing in July, called ADF “a highly successful law firm.”
“Mainers need judges who reflect their views, especially in this moment when we are seeing the key role that the judiciary, courts and individual judges play in upholding democratic principles and constitutional rights in our fragile democracy,” said Lily James, advocacy coordinator for Maine Women’s Lobby.
“We are gravely concerned that, if confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Dunlap will become yet another judge who uses his position to take the side of banks, insurance companies and other corporations, instead of reflecting the values of Mainers and protecting the rights of individuals.”
National advocacy group Accountable.us also flagged Dunlap’s nomination, saying “Dunlap’s nomination is part of President Trump’s campaign to capture the courts with judges hand picked for their loyalty to Trump, instead of their commitment to the Constitution.”
“Joshua Dunlap has an alarming record of advancing anti-choice laws that would take fundamental freedoms away from Americans,” said President Caroline Ciccone. “His extreme ideological advocacy to gut reproductive freedom is out of step with the vast majority of Americans and calls into question his ability to rule impartially on the bench.”
Dunlap did not respond to requests for comment.
Opposition to reproductive rights
When reproductive health care providers are already fighting in federal courts to be able to continue providing care to millions of patients and LGBTQ+ rights under attack, “it is more essential than ever that the court serve as a neutral arbiter and that they maintain the ability to make decisions without bias or prejudice,” said Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.
“The fact is, the statements that Mr. Dunlap has made over the years are deeply at odds with the values of Maine people and the rights they hold dear, and we have grave concern for his ability to be impartial on matters literal, matters of life and death, on which he has taken such extreme and public positions,” she said.
Accountable.us pointed to testimonies and articles by Dunlap, including a 2015 testimony in favor of a bill proposing a parental consent requirement for minors seeking abortions in 2015, where he said that doctors were financially incentivized to encourage young people to terminate their pregnancies, and stated that parental consent requirements were about protecting minors from abuse rather than providing an additional roadblock to abortion. 
In 2017, he signed onto a testimony supporting a Maine fetal personhood bill saying it was  “purely and simply” about ensuring justice in instances of wrongful death of a fetus. Opponents of the bill said that Maine law already provided avenues for legal action in such cases, and said that the bill could lead to abortion restrictions down the line. Neither bill ultimately passed.
Opposing marriage equality  
Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, said Dunlap’s actions and words “indicate that he would rule against non discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people, and roll back marriage equality.”
In an op ed in 2012, Dunlap publicly opposed marriage equality in Maine, complaining about supporters of marriage equality stealing opposing signs. 
“[Marriage equality] supporters vigorously assert that redefining marriage will not affect our rights,” he said in a letter to the editor.
“Yet … supporters have engaged in a concerted campaign to trample free speech by stealing signs. Their criminal behavior tells you everything you need to know about their commitment to freedom.”
He has been dismissive of same sex marriage supporters constitutional arguments, and suggested that he believes LGBTQ+ rights are inherently at odds with religious liberty, Drew said. As a lawyer and legal commentator, Dunlap has repeatedly fought for expansive religious exemptions that would allow people and institutions to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, claiming that religious motivation should be a valid legal defense.
“Dunlap has made clear that he prioritizes ideology over equality and justice,” Drew said. 
“His appointment would put LGBTQ+ people rights at risk, not only in the First Circuit, but across the country, undermining the court’s ability to safeguard the rights of marginalized people and women.”
Supporting big corporations 
Seth Berry, executive director of Our Power, cited examples where Dunlap supported Central Maine Power in overturning a voter-approved measure banning foreign governments and companies with 5% or more foreign government ownership from donating to state referendum races. The law was one of a handful around the country attempting to limit foreign influence on U.S. elections, but CMP’s parent company filed lawsuits to block its application. 
He also defended pharmaceutical companies in opioid cases, represented oil companies accused of climate deception, and sided with banks in foreclosure disputes. Berry argued that Dunlap’s confirmation would serve corporate interests at the expense of Mainers, urging senators not to support his nomination.
“If confirmed, Joshua Dunlap will be a blank check for corporate oligarchy,” he said. 
“U.S. senators who support him will sign the check, but the bills will be paid by Maine people.”

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)The U.S. Department of Justice is sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, the Trump administration confirmed.
The data sharing comes after Justice Department attorneys this summer demanded that election officials in nearly two dozen states turn over their voter lists, alarming some Democratic state secretaries of state and election experts. They have voiced fears about how the Trump administration planned to use the data. Even some Republican secretaries of state have declined to provide their full voter lists.
Homeland Security in an unsigned statement to Stateline called information sharing essential to “scrub aliens from voter rolls” and said the federal government was “finally doing what it should have all along — sharing information to solve problems.”
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

“This collaboration with the DOJ will lawfully and critically enable DHS to prevent illegal aliens from corrupting our republic’s democratic process and further ensure the integrity of our elections nationwide. Elections exist for the American people to choose their leaders, not illegal aliens,” the statement reads.
The Justice Department said in its own statement that state voter roll data provided in response to requests from the department’s Civil Rights Division is “being screened for ineligible voter entries.”
Noncitizen voting is extremely rare. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
The data sharing marks a next step in President Donald Trump’s efforts to exert more federal influence over state-administered elections. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year that sought to require individuals to provide proof-of-citizenship documents to register to vote, a rule quickly blocked in federal court. He has also threatened to sign another executive order attempting to restrict mail ballots.
At least 10 states have either provided publicly available data or given the department directions on how to request public data. It’s unclear whether any state has turned over voter data with all information the Trump administration is seeking.
While the administration didn’t describe how Homeland Security will use the voter rolls to search for noncitizens, the agency operates a powerful program, Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, that can identify the immigration or citizenship status of an individual.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if officials upload the data.
In the past, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm U.S. citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information.
As the Justice Department has sought state voter rolls this summer, letters from the department’s attorneys to state officials in many instances have demanded full lists of registered voters that include sensitive personal information such as driver license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. At least 22 states were asked for some data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which is tracking the requests.
Some states have turned over publicly available voter files or offered directions on how to request them. Others have flat-out refused the requests.
“The Department of Justice hasn’t shown any good reason for its fishing expedition for sensitive voter information on every American,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, said in a news release Monday announcing that her office had rejected the Justice Department’s second request for her state’s voter data.
Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said that he has no confidence that Homeland Security would act carefully with any data received.
Levitt, speaking with Stateline on Wednesday before the data sharing was confirmed, voiced concern that the Justice Department was “serving as a stalking horse” for other entities within the government.
“The fact that they’re having to sneak through the back door rather than knocking on the front door tells you that there’s improper procedures going on,” Levitt said.

Brent Gage, UI associate vice president for enrollment management, said in a news release the university received more than 31,000 first-year student applications ahead of the fall 2025 semester, a record-breaking number.
Of the 5,561 first-year students enrolled at the UI this fall — the university’s second-largest incoming class in its history — 2,879 are state residents and 1,260 come from rural areas. The university reported in the release new students are moving to Iowa City from 93 Iowa counties, 47 U.S. states and territories and 37 countries.
Around one-fifth of the population identified themselves as first-generation students, according to the release, and the class’s average grade-point average came in at 3.86.
Total enrollment at the UI for this fall is 31,563, including 23,407 undergraduates, 6,269 graduate students and 1,887 professional students. Nearly 3,140 medical residents and postdoctoral students call the UI home as well.
“Interest in attending the University of Iowa has never been greater, and this group of students represents talented students from Iowa, across the nation, and around the world,” Gage said in the release. “We are excited to welcome one of the largest first-year classes that we have ever had as they join the Hawkeye community this fall.”
Iowa State University
ISU total enrollment numbers have grown for the third straight year, according to a news release from the university, supported by the incoming class and high second-year retention. The university’s incoming class hit 6,160 this fall, its fifth year in a row of growing first-year cohorts and the largest class ISU has seen since 2016.
More than half of the incoming class are Iowans, according to the release, and all 99 Iowa counties and all 50 U.S. states are represented among new students, as well as 110 countries.
Just over 20% of new students are first-generation, 22% identified as Pell-eligible and 80% are receiving some form of financial aid through scholarships or grants. Nearly three-quarters of 26,346 undergraduate students are receiving financial aid.
The class of 2029 enrolled at ISU with an average ACT score of 25 and grade-point average of 3.76. More than half of the 1,351 transfer students attending ISU this fall came from state community colleges, the release stated.
Of the 31,105 students enrolled at ISU, 4,116 are graduate students and 643 are studying professional veterinary medicine.
“We are proud of the continued growth in enrollment,” said Katharine Johnson Suski, interim associate vice president for enrollment management and executive director of admissions and new student programs, in the release. “That growth reflects our commitment to serving the state with more students from Iowa high schools and community colleges choosing Iowa State.”
University of Northern Iowa
UNI’s sesquicentennial class totals 1,549 students, according to a news release, the third year in a row the university topped 1,500 with its incoming cohorts. Despite increases in new undergraduate and graduate students, bringing their totals to 7,800 and 1,404, respectively, its total enrollment of 9,204 fell short of last year’s total of 9,283.
More than 90% of incoming students are from Iowa, the release stated, representing all 99 counties. The new class also includes students from 42 U.S. states and 53 countries.
“We couldn’t be more excited to welcome our 150th class of UNI students to campus,” said UNI President Mark Nook in the release. “We are particularly encouraged that the numbers of our incoming freshmen, transfers and new graduate students have all increased compared to last year.”
Nearly 75% of new transfer students are coming to UNI from a community college through the UNI@IACC program, a partnership between the Cedar Falls university and Iowa community colleges to ease transfers between the institutions. According to the release, enrollment in the program has grown from 252 students after its launch in 2022 to 539 in 2025. Since its inception, the release stated 348 students have graduated from the program.
UNI also saw increased interest from states bordering Iowa this year, a result the release attributes to the college’s neighboring state tuition rate program, which offers in-state tuition to students applying from Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska, South Dakota and Missouri.

Because program was conceived in response to a big stink about elk numbers and damage, Game and Fish commissioner is 'shocked' by the absence of claims. 
The post No one is using a controversial compensation program for grass lost to overpopulated Wyoming elk appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s been virtually no interest in a new state program to provide financial relief to stockgrowers whose rangelands are grazed by overpopulated elk herds, according to Wyoming wildlife officials. 
The payment program’s slow uptake took some members of the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission by surprise at a Tuesday meeting in Lander. 
“I guess I’m shocked,” Ken Roberts said.
The Game and Fish commissioner from Kemmerer noted the “urgency” portrayed by “a lot of folks” who were “adamant that this had to be done.” Most of the pressure for the compensation came from landowners who’ve struggled to run cattle amid overpopulated elk herds in central and eastern Wyoming.

Game and Fish’s deputy chief of wildlife, Craig Smith, led the conversation and was quick to note that zero claims were filed in the first year of the new policy. Some landowners had inquired about how it works, he said.
Adjustments to Game and Fish’s compensation for “extraordinary damage to rangelands” trace back to summer 2023, when there was a tense Wyoming legislative meeting about elk damage. The following legislative session, the Agriculture Committee brought an unsuccessful but controversial bill that would have mandated compensation rates for grass on dry rangeland lost to elk inside overpopulated big game herd units. Then in fall 2024, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission voluntarily updated its compensation regulations in an effort to placate ranchers and keep lawmakers at bay.  
The compensation plan is specific to non-cultivated livestock rangeland, and there are several requirements: 

Landowners can receive “extraordinary damage to grass” funds when a big game herd is overpopulated by 20% or more for three or more consecutive years and the species is consuming 15% or more of the estimated forage on private ground. (Payments are still possible when herds are not overpopulated if more than 30% of the forage is being consumed.)
Landowners must also allow a “sufficient number of hunters” on the property. That means the necessary number of hunters to offset the “recruitment,” or the number of animals born into the population that survived one year. 

When the new rules were being vetted with the public, they proved widely unpopular with sportspeople — 46 of the 48 public comments on the draft regulation that stated a position opposed the new payment program. The unpopularity stemmed partly from worries that the damage claims could exacerbate an emerging Game and Fish budget crunch. 
“It was supposed to be a substantial amount,” Roberts told WyoFile. 
Although perplexing, the lack of interest is also a relief, he said: “I’m glad to hear it.”

Wyoming Stock Growers Association lobbyist Jim Magagna, who was a major proponent of the legislation and Game and Fish policy change, shared the view.
“I’m certainly glad it didn’t result in a flood of demands for compensation that would overwhelm the available funds,” he said. 
Magagna partly attributed the absence of claims to unfamiliarity with the new funding stream. 
“Landowners are not yet fully aware of that opportunity,” Magagna told WyoFile. “As an organization, we try to keep people aware of things, but we certainly didn’t put anything out encouraging people to apply for damages— it’s an individual decision.”
Wyoming Game and Fish, he added, has also come through in helping frustrated ranchers address overpopulated elk herds via other efforts. 
“The Game and Fish have been responsive with granting licenses to landowners, and they’re even bringing in professional hunters to remove elk,” Magagna said. “If the wildlife populations can be appropriately managed and the claims go away, that’s better for everyone.”

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Federal judges in Rhode Island and Washington have blocked the Trump administration from excluding people without legal immigration status from a group of federal programs, including Head Start early childhood education.
On Wednesday, a federal judge in Rhode Island halted a broad array of rules based on the new immigration restrictions from taking effect. Wisconsin was one of 21 states and the District of Columbia to join that lawsuit.  
Reuters reported that a White House statement said the administration expected a higher court to reverse the decision.
On Thursday, a federal judge in the state of Washington ordered the Trump administration to pause a requirement that Head Start early childhood education programs exclude families without legal immigration status. That ruling came in a case brought by Head Start groups in four states, including Wisconsin.
Head Start programs were included in a broader federal directive that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued July 10 listing federally funded “public benefits” that must exclude immigrants without legal status under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.
Certain programs, such as Medicaid, have been required to verify lawful immigration status for participants. But since 1998, the federal government has considered a range of programs exempt that are generally open to all in a community, according to Reuters.
The July HHS order revoked the 1998 policy and closed the door to immigrants lacking legal status for Head Start along with a collection of programs providing mental health and substance abuse treatment, job training and other assistance.
On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy issued a preliminary injunction that halted orders from HHS as well as the departments of Education, Labor and Justice based on the policy shift.
“The Government’s new policy, across the board, seems to be this: ‘Show me your papers,'” McElroy wrote in her order.
McElroy wrote that the administration acted “in a rushed way, without seeking comment from the public or interested parties,” likely violating the federal Administrative Procedures Act.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez issued a temporary restraining order directing HHS not to apply the immigration restriction to Head Start programs.
Head Start programs have never been required to determine the immigration status of families in the program since it started nearly 60 years ago, according to Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
The Wisconsin association joined the lawsuit against the HHS order filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of Head Start programs in the states of Washington, Illinois and Pennsylvania as well as advocacy groups in California and Oregon.
“This ruling affirms what we know to be both right within the law and right for communities,” Mauer told the Wisconsin Examiner on Friday. “Keeping eligible Head Start Families in the program is the best outcome for Wisconsin. Kids are safer and it keeps Wisconsin working.”
Martinez wrote in a 26-page opinion focused on the Head Start portion in the HHS order that harms the plaintiffs warned of “are not merely speculative.” Martinez was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed in 2004.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs told the court that a Wisconsin Head Start program reported at least four families withdrew after the federal directive was issued. Several Pennsylvania programs reported withdrawals, one reported that it expects to have to close and another said it will have to close one of its rooms due to a drop in enrollment.
The plaintiffs’ arguments “detail confusion on how to comply with the Directive, how to verify immigration status, who status is based on, whether non-profits are exempt, difficulties in recruiting and families obtaining proper documentation, and the families’ overall fear that reporting immigration status will result in a choice between family safety and a child’s education,” Martinez wrote.
The directive has unclear guidance and has had a “chilling effect” on programs as well as on families who have relied on Head Start, resulting “in the immediate harm of childhood education loss” and “leading to long-term harms in development,” he wrote. “It also results in parents losing childcare, risking missed work, unemployment, forced dropouts, and inability to pay life expenses and support families.”

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Parole Board will hold clemency hearings later this month for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward, whose execution is scheduled for Oct. 10 at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. 
The board announced this week that the five-member panel will conduct a clemency interview hearing at the prison on Friday, Sept. 19 at 10 a.m. Central Time.
A public clemency hearing will follow on Monday, Sept. 22, at the Indiana Government Center South Auditorium in Indianapolis. Testimony in support of clemency will be allowed from 9 to 11 a.m., followed by testimony in opposition from 1 to 3 p.m.
Ward, 44, was sentenced to death after he pleaded guilty to the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County. His case has played out through state and federal courts for more than two decades. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2017.
Execution moves forward as questions linger around Indiana’s lethal injection drugs

In late August, the Indiana Supreme Court finalized his October execution date after denying his latest appeal.
The clemency process is one of the final steps available for prisoners to avoid a death sentence. 
The Parole Board hears arguments from attorneys, victims’ families and execution supporters before issuing a recommendation to the governor. 
The governor alone has the power to commute a death sentence to life in prison, grant a reprieve or deny clemency altogether. 
Earlier this year, the board followed the same process for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, ahead of his scheduled execution. Following several hours of hearings, the parole board ultimately — unanimously — recommended against clemency for Benjamin Ritchie, and Gov. Mike Braun allowed his execution to proceed.
Ward’s legal counsel is continuing to raise questions about Indiana’s lethal injection procedures and has repeatedly pressed for records detailing the state’s supply of pentobarbital — the drug used in executions — especially about its quality and whether it has expired.
The inmate’s defense team said they also plan to pursue additional legal challenges in state and federal courts in the weeks leading up to the execution.
Braun said earlier this month that Indiana’s Department of Correction does not yet have the necessary execution drugs in hand.
When asked about the state’s drug supply, the governor reiterated that Indiana is taking steps to ensure doses do not expire before use.

MONTPELIER — The U.S. Department of Justice this week asked Vermont to hand over sensitive personal information on all of the state’s registered voters, Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas said Friday.
The secretary also said she intends to reject the justice department’s request. That’s in line with public statements she made last month, after her office received a separate but related inquiry from the feds about the possibility of information-sharing.
Copeland Hanzas’ office received a letter from the department’s civil division on Monday asking it to furnish the voter data, she said.
The secretary said her office is working with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office to draft a formal reply, which she expects to send soon.

A federal judge in July ruled Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding as the nation’s largest abortion provider fights Trump’s administration over efforts to defund the organization in his signature tax legislation.
Medicaid is a government health care program that serves millions of low-income and disabled Americans. Nearly half of Planned Parenthood’s patients rely on Medicaid.
A provision in Trump’s tax bill instructed the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, even to those like Planned Parenthood that also offer medical services like contraception, pregnancy tests and STD testing.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its member organizations in Massachusetts and Utah filed a lawsuit in July against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“While the Trump administration wants to rip away reproductive freedom, we’re here to say loud and clear: we will not back down,” Dominique Lee, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts said in a statement. “This is not over.”
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to an online request for comment.
Planned Parenthood said Thursday’s ruling means that more than 1.1 million patients can’t use their Medicaid insurance at its health centers. That also puts as many as 200 of those health centers at risk of closure, Planned Parenthood said in a statement.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Chris Winters, commissioner of the Vermont Department for Children and Families, plans to step down. 
Instead, he is set to become deputy commissioner of the Department of Labor on Sept. 22, Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday in a press release. 
Scott also appointed Rick Hildebrant to lead the Department of Health. Hildebrant works as the chief medical information officer and medical director of hospital medicine at Rutland Regional Medical Center. His appointment takes effect Oct. 13. 
Hildebrant replaces Mark Levine, the face of Vermont’s Covid-19 response, who retired in March. 
“Even as public health leadership faces challenges nationally, Vermont has consistently demonstrated that collaboration, science, and community can chart a different course,” Hildebrant said in the release. 
Winters, who previously served as deputy secretary of state, took over DCF in 2023 after an unsuccessful bid to become secretary of state. Sandi Hoffman, deputy commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, is slated to take over for Winters in an interim capacity at the department, which, among other responsibilities, oversees economic benefits, some social services and child welfare. 
In the release, Scott thanked Winters for his “steady leadership.” 
DCF’s top position is widely considered one of the most difficult in state government, and Winters has faced challenges during his tenure. 
The department oversees Vermont’s motel voucher program, which puts unhoused residents in motel rooms across the state. The program is a lightning rod for lawmakers and Scott, and as it’s downsized, Winters’ department has taken flak for the waves of motel evictions that pushed people to live outside. 
In January, the ACLU of Vermont sued DCF for allegedly tracking the pregnancies of Vermonters deemed “high-risk” and seeking custody of an unborn child. That litigation remains ongoing. 
At the Department of Labor, Winters will work under Kendal Smith, who previously served as deputy commissioner and interim commissioner, and whom Scott appointed in an official capacity Friday.

Members of a task force appointed by the Kansas State Board of Education to consider solutions to deaf education […],"Kansas deaf education task force member Kylie Stewart, center, said the state needed to address the teacher shortage in deaf education. She said the School for the Deaf student deficits in reading and math assessments needed to be a priority of the Kansas State Board of Education and the Kansas Legislature. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — Lack of a Kansas-based bachelor’s degree program to prepare specialists in teaching of deaf or hard of hearing students complicates the challenge of hiring fully qualified staff at the Kansas School for the Deaf.
Members of a task force appointed by the Kansas State Board of Education to consider solutions to deaf education issues also say uncompetitive salaries at the state’s school for 150 elementary and secondary students in Olathe made it challenging to attract educators once they’ve completed bachelor’s or master’s degrees in other states.
One member of the task force, which met at the School for the Deaf on Thursday to work on reform recommendations, said it was time the state Board of Education amended unrealistic licensing standards that made it too arduous for people drawn to the field of deaf education to secure mandated graduate-level credentials.
“The real-world impact of that is KSD can’t find teachers,” said Zach Wentz, a task force member representing School for the Deaf parents. “As a result they don’t do performance reviews the way that they’re supposed to and, so actually, you have teachers who shouldn’t be here because they’re not being held accountable. You’re motivating the school to make that decision because they know they can’t replace them if they get rid of them.”
Members of the task force likewise suggested Kansas begin subsidizing tuition and fees for students enrolled in deaf education programs.
In addition, task force members said, the state could pay stipends to out-of-state student teachers who would complete that undergraduate obligation at School for the Deaf and possibly remain in Kansas to take these hard-to-fill special education jobs.
Only 165 of the state’s 36,000 licensed classroom teachers hold a license for deaf education, according to the Kansas Department of Education.
“If that’s your kid sitting in that classroom, you’re thinking, can the state not figure out a way to simplify this a little bit but still ensure that teachers have their skills? That almost seems like a no-win situation right now with the teacher shortage,” said Kylie Stewart, a task force member and a college special education instructor.
She said changes need to be made to improve reading and math assessment scores for students enrolled there.
Luanne Barron, superintendent of the School for the Deaf, said 57% of the current staff at the school had dual licenses to teach in the education field and to instruct deaf students. The remainder of the school’s staff lacked a portion of that licensing package, she said, but were allowed to provide instruction on a temporary basis.
“One thing that I think that Kansas really needs to invest the time and energy into is … identifying a university who will take the lead and house a deaf ed program,” Barron said.
She said the University of Kansas’ decision to phase out its deaf education degree in 2019 after a long period of declining enrollment took away a cadre of students who could complete student teaching requirements at School for the Deaf.
“The last few years,” she said, “we haven’t had anybody come as a student teacher.”
Shane Carter, director of teacher licensing in the Kansas State Department of Education, told the task force that establishing a bachelor’s degree in deaf education at a Kansas college or university was a “very sound” strategy.
He pushed back on the idea Kansas education licensure standards were driving the shortage of deaf education professionals in the state.
To help fill the more immediate teacher gap, the School for the Deaf superintendent said, Kansas should consider authorizing the awarding of certificates in deaf education after completion of a certain number of specialized courses. Or, she said, the state could allow individuals to take a comprehensive exam to demonstrate proficiency in the instruction of deaf students.
“The problem is convincing universities to set up some sort of certificate program, while also convincing the (state) Board of Education to accept it. You have to do both,” Barron said.
Lisa Karney, the task force chair who holds master’s degrees in special education and deaf education, said it would be a mistake to make changes that compromised academic rigor of teacher preparation requirements.
In part, she said, her hesitancy to embrace sweeping licensing changes reflected the immersive educational demands placed on teachers at the School for the Deaf.
“It’s crucial that you keep the rigor,” Karney said. “There’s the whole spectrum that has to be looked at and offered and taught.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wentz-Stewart-Carter-deaf-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 11:58:28.437606

(Phil McKenna/Inside Climate News)CAMERON — Ray Mallett started fishing near the mouth of the Calcasieu River more than half a century ago as part of the “mosquito fleet,” a ragtag group of kids that plied the surrounding rivers and bayous in small motorboats in search of crabs.
A Gulf Coast fisherman like his father before him, Mallett harvested shrimp for decades from an estuary in Southwest Louisiana that was once the seafood capital of America.
Now, he can hardly catch enough shrimp to pay for fuel.

“Each year we’re getting less and less,” Mallett said, standing at the helm of his boat, Cajun Memories. The name is a nod to his roots, and as one of the last remaining shrimp boats in Cameron’s port, a once-thriving fishery.
Harvests from the Calcasieu River, where shrimp migrate each year to spawn, have declined for decades as chemical plants and refineries located farther upstream have polluted the Calcasieu, making it one of the country’s most endangered rivers.
Catches dropped even further in recent years and Mallett, along with an increasingly vocal group of fishermen, has theories about why.
It’s “because of the … darn plant,” said Mallett, a slight but sinewy 63-year-old with a grey goatee and the image of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns tattooed on his forearm.
The plant he’s referring to is Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass, a sprawling 432-acre liquefied natural gas terminal at the mouth of the Calcasieu River. The export terminal has loaded hundreds of ocean-going vessels with LNG fuel since operations began in 2022, helping to make the U.S. the world’s largest exporter of LNG. But the facility also brought noise and pollution; according to local fishermen, the industrial activity drives off shrimp.
“The shrimp don’t want to cross that barrier for some reason,” Mallett said.
“If there’s not many that come in to spawn, to have babies that go back out, you’re gonna get less and less each year,” Mallett added. “And that’s exactly what happened.”

Jeffrey Plumlee, a researcher at Louisiana State University and a fisheries extension specialist for Louisiana Sea Grant, said much remains unknown about the impact of the construction and operation of the terminals.
“The impact of LNG, specifically, these plants, has not been measured,” Plumlee said. “We don’t really have any great answers.”
Phillip Dyson grew up fishing alongside Mallett. He quit school at 13 to become a shrimper and has fished the inland waters of the Calcasieu River for the past 50 years. Before the plant was built, his boat brought in $125,000 to $175,000 per year. In 2023, Dyson said he made less than half that. Last year, he barely made enough to survive.
“Every year it drops and drops,” said Dyson, 63, standing next to one of his family’s shrimp boats, Papa’s Shadow, which is overdue for repainting and maintenance that Dyson says he can no longer afford. “If it wasn’t for Social Security, I’d go bankrupt.”

An average of 1.5 million pounds of shrimp were harvested from the Calcasieu Basin each year between 2015 and 2024, according to Peyton Cagle, the marine fisheries operations program manager for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. The figure dropped to just 750,000 pounds in 2024, or half of the 10-year average, he said.
However, Cagle said the changes in the harvest cannot be attributed to a single cause.
“Lower dockside prices, increased expenses, market competition from imported shrimp, and a reduction in the fleet are some of the reasons for the decline in landings,” Cagle said in a written statement.
While shrimp harvests were down 50% in the Calcasieu Basin in 2024, they also declined by an average of nearly 30% across all of coastal Louisiana last year, Cagle added.

Venture Global is now building Calcasieu Pass 2, a second LNG terminal adjacent to its existing facility, which will have double the export capacity. The plant is part of a massive expansion of new LNG terminals along the Gulf Coast, which will more than double America’s already world-leading export capacity.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas projects and has approved more than 99 percent of all project applications in recent decades, authorized construction for Calcasieu Pass 2 in June 2024.
However, the decision wasn’t unanimous.
The project’s adverse environmental and local economic impacts “are so great that I am compelled to find that approving the project is inconsistent with the public interest,” Allison Clements, a former FERC commissioner, wrote in her dissent just days before her four-year term at the agency ended.
“The Order improperly discounts impacts to commercial fishing businesses, which will likely be significant,” Clements added.
Dredging near the terminal is a primary concern noted in FERC’s Environmental Impact Statement for the project.
Approximately 6.4 million cubic yards of material — enough to fill 1,957 Olympic-sized swimming pools — will be excavated to create deep water berths for LNG vessels to dock and turn around at the terminal, according to the commission’s assessment.

Dredging would kick up sediment in the water, which may affect the health of shrimp, fish and other marine species by clogging their gills and reducing dissolved oxygen levels, according to the report.
Environmental advocates and state regulators have expressed concern about dredging, particularly during the migration periods for fish and shrimp, which coincide with the spring and fall commercial shrimp harvesting seasons.
In a March 2023 letter to the commission, Randell Myers, an assistant secretary with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked if Venture Global would consider limiting dredging activity to times of year that would not interfere with migration periods for shrimp and other species, as well as commercial fishing.
In its final assessment, FERC noted that the company didn’t anticipate any pauses on dredging during seasonal migration periods. The commission stated that doing so would leave the dredged area exposed to “tidal, wind, and wave action” over a longer period, potentially several months, which could exacerbate sedimentation issues.
Michael Tritico, a former coastal zone manager for southwest Louisiana tasked with protecting and developing the region’s natural resources and an environmental advocate, said not pausing during key migration periods is “the cheap way out.”
“It’s inconvenient and costs more to have the work crew leave and come back later,” Tritico said. “It’s an economic thing, and it’s not a logical scientific argument.”
Venture Global did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Plumlee said shrimp are often referred to as a “year crop” in that they live for approximately one year and their population is replenished annually. Each female shrimp releases up to a million eggs. If even a small portion of the estuary’s shrimp population can migrate in and out of the river mouth, the population will likely remain stable over time, he said.
As long as the resources juvenile shrimp need to develop, including good marsh habitat, tidal water flows and food, remain, “then I foresee them recovering quickly.”
Environmental advocates said the increased ship traffic from additional LNG terminals, not counting any disruptions from the facilities themselves, will have lasting impacts from which the shrimp may never recover.
Venture Global has plans for Calcasieu Pass 3, a third LNG export terminal at the mouth of the Calcasieu River with potential export capacity nearly equal to that of its first two terminals combined. In addition, Commonwealth LNG, an export terminal on the opposite bank of the Calcasieu River from Venture Global’s facilities, received final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy on Aug. 29 and may soon begin construction. Each of these facilities will draw massive oceangoing vessels to the rivermouth.
“They want to [add] six, seven, eight more ships every day,” said James Hiatt, founder of For a Better Bayou, a local environmental and community advocacy organization. “What you’ll have is just an insane amount of ship traffic in a place that is feeling effects of the traffic we already have. At what point is enough enough?”

In February 2023, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory committee to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, sent a letter to state and federal agencies responsible for permitting Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG export terminal, warning about the potential impact of this and other proposed LNG terminals.
“This is a radical transformation of the Louisiana coast,” the letter, signed by Acy Cooper, then chairman of the task force and a commercial shrimper, stated. “If successful, this construction and expansion will destroy the shrimping community in Cameron Parish and have serious consequences throughout the State.”
The letter ended with a warning. If the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries waits to assess the damage from gas export facilities until after they are constructed, it “will be far too late.”
Cagle, of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, said the agency conducts biweekly or monthly monitoring of shrimp abundance and size and has not seen “any alarming reductions” since construction of Calcasieu Pass and Calcasieu Pass 2 began.

If the department notices any impacts after Calcasieu Pass 2 is constructed, they would initiate an impact analysis at that time, Cagle said.
Since writing the letter, the task force, as well as the Louisiana Shrimp Association, an industry group also headed by Cooper, have focused more on the issue of low-cost shrimp imported to the U.S. from aquaculture farms in Asia.
Imports began in large numbers in the 1990s and have continued to climb, reaching 93 percent of all shrimp consumed in the U.S. in 2024, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, causing a steep and decades-long decline in the price of U.S.-caught shrimp, according to a federal fisheries report published in August.
The Shrimp Association praised a 50% tariff the Trump administration placed on imports from India, the largest importer of shrimp to the U.S, on Aug. 27. However, the group didn’t comment when President Trump issued an executive order in January lifting a Biden administration pause on U.S. Department of Energy permits for new LNG export terminals, including Calcasieu Pass 2.
LNG terminals require federal approval from FERC and the DOE. A DOE permit for Venture Global’s new facility was issued in March, which, along with FERC approval in May, allowed for construction to begin.
Cooper said the LNG issue hasn’t been on the association’s agenda for a while.
State regulators halted dredging in the Calcasieu River near the proposed CP2 terminal on August 8 after fishermen reported sediment from the project spilled beyond its intended containment area in a nearby wildlife refuge. The dredging was conducted by the Cameron Parish Port, Harbor and Terminal District in conjunction with Venture Global, which funded the project and maintained the pipe used to transport the sediment to the refuge.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Patrick Courreges, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources, said further dredging would be suspended until state and federal regulators approved a process for collecting and returning the lost dredge material.
For a Better Bayou, and Earthjustice said the spill was impacting crab, oyster and shrimp fisheries and was a potential violation of the Clean Water Act. The organizations submitted a letter to the state department of energy and natural resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last month seeking immediate enforcement action, including civil penalties.
The environmental assessment by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas projects, also noted that prolonged exposure to elevated noise from dredging, pile driving and other construction activity can interfere with an animal’s behavior, such as “migrating, feeding, resting, or reproducing.”
State and federal permits for the project set limits on noise pollution from the facility’s construction and operation as measured at nearby onshore locations. However, there are no noise limits for the marine environment. Habitat Recovery Project, a local conservation organization that works with local fishermen and women, received a grant from the American Geophysical Union last October to measure noise pollution in the water and its impact on marine life.
The monitoring work will be aided and expanded to assess other potential stressors to fisheries in the Lower Calcasieu River through a grant from the Community Resilience Center at The Water Institute, a research organization based in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
Alyssa Portaro, executive director of Habitat Recovery Project, said she hopes the projects will provide the scientific data necessary to establish guardrails on LNG developments, such as seasonal restrictions on dredging or time-of-day restrictions on tanker movements, which would reduce the facilities’ impact on shrimp and other marine life.
“That would be a win for me,” Portraro said.
Others are less optimistic.
“This is not an industry that can peacefully coexist,” said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program for Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. “They’ve just gotten started.”
Environmental advocates continue to push back. Commercial fishermen, impacted landowners, and environmental groups are continuing their lawsuit against FERC over its approval of the Calcasieu Pass 2 terminal.
Meanwhile, Earthjustice is challenging the project’s dredging permits issued by the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources. The Sierra Club and other environmental organizations recently filed suit against the state’s Department of Environmental Quality over the project’s air permits. At the same time, Habitat Recovery Project, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade and the Environmental Law Clinic at Tulane University submitted a notice of intent to sue Venture Global for violations of the Clean Air Act at its existing Calcasieu Pass facility.
The Bucket Brigade, an environmental group based in New Orleans, previously noted more than 2,000 instances where emissions from the facility exceeded allowable limits during the facility’s first year of operation. The environmental groups haven’t yet filed their lawsuit; however, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has since sent Venture Global a notice of potential penalties for its emissions.
For Ray Mallett and the other fishermen, any relief from additional LNG development on the Calcasieu River can’t come soon enough. When the inshore shrimp season opened on August 11, Mallett loaded his boat, Cajun Memories, with several days’ worth of supplies and headed east toward Vermilion Bay, a 12-and-a-half-hour journey, in search of shrimp.
“I couldn’t make any money here,” Mallet said. “I had to go elsewhere.”

You can read more about the section here.

I’m a retired pediatrician and current medical educator. I’ve dedicated my life to caring for patients, training the next generation of physicians and advocating for healthcare access.
I also happen to live with a disability and use a wheelchair. For me, Medicaid is much more than a policy issue—it’s personal.
Despite the passage of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the most significant reductions in Medicaid funding will not take effect for at least two years, giving Congress an opportunity to correct its own mistake. Congress should mitigate the impacts of this legislation to help ensure patient access to care.
Beyond providing care for half of America’s children, Medicaid covers older adults, those in between jobs and people living with disabilities. Many of the people I’ve worked with – although not technically “disabled” – are still unable to work full time due to undiagnosed health conditions, limited access to employment and other barriers. Medicaid is often the only safeguard standing between them and disaster.
I often reflect on my early experience as a pediatrician during the rollout of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in the late 1990s. Until then, I had assumed most children had coverage, but when my clinic began accepting CHIP, I saw just how many families had been previously left behind.
That moment showed me just how essential healthcare advocacy is in my profession, which is why I strive to instill a passion for advocacy in the next generation of doctors.
Medicaid plays an outsized role in states like Mississippi where 60% of its recipients live in a rural area. In these underserved areas, Medicaid keeps clinics open and doctors caring for patients. Cutting the program now, when Americans and our healthcare systems are already struggling, would be heartbreaking.
Pediatric practices like mine will struggle to provide access, diagnoses and treatments might come later and at increased cost, and families will lose access to preventive care that keeps children out of the hospital.
My decades of work in Mississippi, particularly with children facing chronic conditions, have shown me how essential Medicaid remains.
Now, I’m deeply disappointed that the national conversation has shifted from expanding Medicaid access to protecting its survival.
After years working with civic and medical leaders to broaden Medicaid coverage, I now find myself forced to defend the program’s very existence.
Beyond providing for children, Mississippi nursing homes depend on Medicaid more than almost any other state, with nearly three in four residents enrolled in Medicaid. Cuts to the program would result in fewer staff and reduced services while placing a larger strain on facilities. Furthermore, even though seniors and people with disabilities make up just 35% of enrollees, they account for 66% of total Medicaid spending, illustrating the program’s role in supporting these vulnerable groups.
Although the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has been signed into law, implementation of Medicaid cuts still hangs in the balance. For example, of the nearly $1 trillion that is currently expected to be cut, the most impactful provisions won’t take place until 2027 or 2028, such as caps on provider taxes and state-directed payments, which help keep rural clinics open and operating.
Congress has ample time to reverse course and put patients first. Before the full severity of these cuts are implemented, lawmakers should roll back harmful cuts and changes to Medicaid to safeguard all Americans, as well as the hospitals and health systems that children, families and seniors depend on.

Law enforcement arrested Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Washington County resident. He was booked into the Utah County Jail.
“We got him,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said.
Kirk, a widely known and often polarizing conservative activist known for debating students on college campuses, was shot and killed during a Turning Point USA public speaking event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, unleashing a search that involved more than 20 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The FBI also offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the shooter.

According to Cox, a family member turned Robinson in. The suspect’s family member contacted the Washington County Sheriff’s Office saying Robinson had confessed or implied he had shot Kirk.
The information was relayed to investigators at the FBI and Utah Valley University, who reviewed additional surveillance footage from the university and identified Robinson arriving on campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at about 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

The family member who sent the tip said Robinson had become more political in recent years and that prior to Wednesday, he had mentioned Kirk’s visit to Utah Valley University.
“Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU. They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints that he had. The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate. The family member also confirmed Robinson had a gray Dodge Challenger,” Cox said.
Messages shared with law enforcement by Robinson’s roommate included Discord messages from Robinson “stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.”
The messages also referred to engraving bullets.
Cox said inscriptions on the shell casings included messages like “Hey fascist! Catch!” and “bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao” and “if you read this, you are gay LMAO.”
Charging documents may be filed early next week, Cox said.

“This is a very sad day for, again, for our country, a terrible day for the state of Utah, but I’m grateful that at this moment, we have an opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in our nation’s history,” Cox said.
FBI Director Kash Patel, who traveled to Utah during the investigation, thanked the governor and the local law enforcement agencies for resolving the case. 
Forensic evidence has been analyzed in different FBI labs across the country, and state and local authorities will continue to process evidence, Patel said.
“In less than 36 hours, 33 to be precise, thanks to the full weight of the federal government and leading out with the partners here in the state of Utah and Gov. Cox, the suspect was apprehended in a historic time period,” Patel said.
Earlier on Friday morning, President Donald Trump said a suspect was in custody.
“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him,” he said on Fox News.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Three Florida Cabinet members would support revocation by the U.S. Department of State of visas held by legal immigrants who celebrate the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.
Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia and Attorney General James Uthmeier argue admission into the United States is a “privilege” that shouldn’t be extended to immigrants who praise Kirk’s murder, Ingoglia and an Uthmeier aide told The Florida Phoenix. This comes one day after the State Department warned immigrants against mocking or praising 31-year-old Kirk’s death.
“Immigrants get visas, among other reasons, because the U.S. has First Amendment freedoms they don’t have in their own countries. If they’re caught celebrating the assassination of someone expressing free speech, they obviously haven’t learned the lesson,” Ingoglia, who sponsored stringent anti-illegal immigration legislation as a state senator, said in a text message.
“Send them home.”
Uthmeier’s communications director, Jeremy Redfern, said the attorney general’s office would “absolutely” support revoking these individuals’ visas and denying future entry to migrants who praised Kirk’s murder.
“Getting a visa to come into the U.S. is a privilege, not a right,” Redfern said. After this story was published, Agriculture commissioner Wilton Simpson added that he makes “three members” of the Florida cabinet to support visa revocation.
The Department of State directed staff Thursday to “undertake appropriate action” for immigrants who “glorify” Kirk’s death. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau added that these individuals “are not welcome visitors to our country.”
A State Department spokesperson told the Phoenix via email that the Trump administration doesn’t think visas should be granted to “persons whose presence in our country does not align” with national security interests.
It wouldn’t be the first time the Trump administration has authorized visa cancellation, revocation, or withholding from current or prospective U.S. immigrants. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered the use of artificial intelligence to identify foreign-born pro-Palestine protesters and revoke their student visas.
The move was aligned with President Donald Trump’s January executive order targeting visa holders who “threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology.” It also aligns with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call for the federal government to deport foreign-born students who he said were setting up university encampments to protest Israel.
The governor’s office declined to comment for this story. State Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent who formerly served as the Senate’s Minority Leader, told the Phoenix that although an immigration attorney would be more clear on the legalities of mass visa revocation, national security and public safety is cause for removal.
“Anyone here on a visa, celebrating the assassination of an American citizen, should be swiftly revoked and removed,” Pizzo said.

Kirk, co-founder of the conservative Turning Point USA, was shot and killed in Orem, Utah, Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University.

He’d forged close relationships with President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, who canceled his scheduled 9/11 memorial appearance in New York to instead visit Kirk’s wife and two children.

In a news release from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office, the funding from the agency’s Revitalization and Placemaking program would go toward creating housing and commercial space in Detroit and Dowagiac, as well as the creation of a new boutique hotel in Calumet.
A vacant building in Manistique would also be transformed into residential and commercial space using grant funding from the Michigan Community Revitalization Program.
“With these new projects in Detroit, Dowagiac, Calumet, and Manistique, we are growing Michigan’s economy and focusing on the people, places, and projects that make Michigan the best place to live, work, and play,” Whitmer said in a statement. “[These programs] create vibrant places that attract and retain talent, add new housing options, enable business creation and attraction, and provide resources for our Michigan communities.”
In Detroit, a $186,842 grant will be used to redevelop a vacant two story building in the city’s Grand River corridor into two commercial spaces with affordable housing on the second floor. 
In Dowagiac, the Wounded Minnow Building, the largest historic building in the city’s downtown corridor, will be redone to provide 10 apartments, while reconfiguring the commercial space occupied by the Wounded Minnow Saloon. The project is supported by $1.4 million in grant funding. 
Two long vacant buildings in Calumet would be redeveloped into a 17 bed boutique hotel and upscale restaurant, supported by $1.5 million in grant funding. 
In Manistique, a former funeral home would be transformed into five apartments and three commercial storage spaces, intended to help address the city’s housing shortage. The state is providing $995,000 in grant funding for the revitalization project.

COVID cases in Connecticut remained relatively stable from March through early July, before rising in late July and August. Hospitalizations from COVID, which remained low throughout the summer months, also rose in August.
“Anecdotally, I’ve been hearing about more cases, and the data also always lags behind what’s actually happening,” said Manisha Juthani, commissioner of the Department of Public Health.
While half as many cases were reported in August 2025 as August 2024, case numbers are, in part, a function of how many people choose to get tested. 
“Not every COVID case is being reported to us. So if somebody goes to an urgent care, or maybe just does a self test, we won’t get that data,” Juthani said.
On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont released a statement encouraging all adults, and children older than 6 months, to get a COVID-19 booster shot.
Wastewater surveillance, which tests for COVID-19 concentration in wastewater, saw an increase in late July and at the end of August, otherwise remaining low through the early summer.
“I don’t really know if [COVID cases are] coming down, or if this is going to be part and parcel of the beginning of an early fall into winter increase,” said Juthani. “I think that remains to be seen.”

(Getty Images)Nevada should stop giving tax breaks to tech companies that build data centers in the state. 
Nevada should instead charge hefty fees and impose robust community benefit conditions on tech companies that build data centers in the state.
Nevada should demand that the cost of electricity needed to run data centers will be paid exclusively by the tech companies on whose behalf the centers are operated. 
Nevada should prohibit the companies and utilities from passing those electricity costs to other customers, especially residential ones.
Retroactively taking away tax breaks the state already granted would land Nevada in legal battles it would presumably lose. 
But Nevada can halt giveaways to, and start demanding more from, companies seeking to build new data centers. All that would take is some tweaks to the state’s demeaning and self-deprecating “economic development” statutes.
Nevada should at least do that.
Corporations are always refining their mastery of categorizing, defining, and generally masquerading reported costs and revenues in ways that benefit them and stick it to everybody else. 
So Nevada would have to fight tooth and nail to protect electricity consumers from getting saddled with skyrocketing power bills as a result of data center electricity demand. 
Nevada should at least try.
Jobs, jobs, and snow jobs
Last year, when Google announced it was spending $400 million to build a second big data center in Nevada, bringing its total data center investments in recent years to north of $2 billion in the state, Gov. Joe Lombardo gushed “This investment further cements our state’s reputation as a new tech capital of the West.”
“Tech capital” sounds like something involving a rather large workforce of highly trained employees whose handsome incomes ripple throughout their communities in soothing waves of broadly shared prosperity.
But apart from the construction phase, the data center industry has, as one operator told the Wall Street Journal, “rightly earned a dismal reputation of creating the lowest number of jobs per square foot” of perhaps any indoor commercial enterprise.
Detailed data center, well, data on employment can be hard to come by. One tracking firm tallies 60 data centers (large and small) in Nevada, and according to an Axios analysis of Census data, last year there were about 3,000 data center workers in the state.
Those 3,000 jobs are the equivalent of less than two-tenths of 1% of the Nevada workforce.
That’s in line with the scale of the data center workforce nationally. Early this year the Census Bureau published a brief on national data center employment estimating the facilities employed a half-million workers in 2023,  about three-tenths of 1% of the nation’s workforce at the time.
The global corporate, financial, and governmental rush to plant gazillion square-foot server farms on seemingly every sizable parcel of currently unoccupied dry land on the planet is (again, except for the short-term construction phase) not much of a job-creator.
Stop groveling
The largest single contributor to U.S. gross domestic product is consumer spending.
Or it was.
Through the first six months of this year, tech company investment to build and equip data centers contributed more to U.S. gross domestic product than consumer spending.
So what are we —  which is to say society, humanity, the world, Nevada, etc. —  getting for all that investment, apart from higher power bills, deepfakes, the elimination of jobs, and the dismantling of career ladders?
“AI is contributing to an incredibly wide range of potential longer-term economic outcomes,” reads a brief published by the Council on Foreign Relations early this month. “The proposed aftermath of broad AI adoption ranges from productivity booms that leave large swaths of the population out of work, to incremental innovation and role augmentation, to the stuff of dark sci-fi movies.”
But wait there’s more. The CFR report notes that Nvidia and the handful of tech giants who buy its chips to stuff into their data centers accounted for more than 80% of the S&P 500’s growth over the first half of 2025. 
So that’s another thing we get for all that tech company investment: a bull market, and perhaps an irrationally exuberant one.
The CFR paper refrains from using the phrase “AI bubble” in reference to a potentially very overvalued stock market. By contrast, The Atlantic, one of oodles of publications that are not shying away from the b-word, notes that if there’s a bubble and it pops, “the silver lining would be that fears of sudden AI-driven job displacement are overblown.”
While everyone waits to see what the brave new world has in store for the people in it, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, along with less godly entities, plan to continue collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on more data centers.
Nevada’s data center presence could quadruple (and it probably will unless the boom goes bust first) and it still wouldn’t be a “tech capital.” Or even a data center capital. Compared to California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, Virginia, New York and several other mostly coastal states, Nevada is a U.S. data center bit player. AI is going to play out how AI is going to play out, no matter what Nevada thinks or says or does.
But Nevada could at least show some self respect and not grovel before tech companies along the way.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2211086231-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-09-12 10:58:05.606155

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)President Donald Trump on Thursday approved federal disaster relief funds to aid communities damaged by June 20-21 storms that included multiple tornadoes, large hail and straight-line winds.
The presidential disaster declaration opens up federal aid for 19 counties for public infrastructure and recovery efforts. The declaration does not include a dollar amount. 
When Gov. Kelly Armstrong made the request on July 21, a preliminary damage assessment exceeded $11.4 million. The total federal aid could end up being higher based on the applications of those seeking to recoup damages, according to the governor’s office.
“This much-needed disaster aid will help our state’s communities and utilities recover from one of the most powerful summer storms in recent history,” Armstrong said in a statement late Thursday. 
Counties eligible for assistance under the presidential declaration are Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells counties.
The approval comes 52 days after Armstrong submitted the request. Earlier this week, state officials commented during an Emergency Commission meeting that the state typically receives a response to disaster aid requests within 30 days.  
A separate request for federal disaster relief submitted last week for August storms is still under review. That request covers Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties. The storm that included damaging winds, large hail and multiple tornadoes caused an estimated $6 million in damage, mostly to electrical infrastructure.
The state also started a program to help farmers pay for temporary grain storage and repair and replace damaged farm facilities or equipment. For more information on the Grain Storage and Facility Rebuilder Program, visit the program website.

	“We made jokes about it at the time like, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be interesting if all the seismologists in the country were killed in the catastrophic landslide?” said Mike West, Alaska’s state seismologist and director of the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
In September, just five months later, at the aptly named Surprise Inlet, the slope failed, and a succession of five landslides dumped debris into the water, triggering a localized tsunami exactly where the seismologists had paused during their field trip.

	And a month ago, at a scenic fjord elsewhere in Alaska, a mountainside collapsed into a fjord called Tracy Arm about 80 miles southeast of Juneau. The Aug. 10 event generated a tsunami that ran at least 1,500 feet up the wall on the other side of the fjord. It was the biggest Alaska landslide since 2015, when the collapse of a mountainside in a remote part of Wrangell St. Elias National Park caused one of the biggest slides in North American history and generated a 630-foot-high tsunami at a site called Taan Fjord.
Such landslide-triggered tsunamis can be deadly. In 2017, four people were killed by one in Greenland.
In the recent Alaska tsunamis, the most serious loss was a kayak and other gear that was swept out to sea at Tracy Arm. The affected campers, on an island about 4 miles away from the landslide, reported a 100-foot wave that morning but were otherwise unharmed.

	Alaska’s luck may not last, warn scientists with the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
The center has gathered several Alaska experts into a program called the Tsunamigenic SLope Instabilities Partnership, or Arctic T-SLIP, to help address the risks of tsunami-generated landslides amid Alaska’s melting glaciers and thawing permafrost,
“Hazards from landslides and landslide-generated tsunamis are increasing. Among all the natural hazards in Alaska, this hazard is the least quantified and integrated into local, state, and federal hazard management practices,” the Arctic T-SLIP website says.
Alaska’s daunting challenges
Other glaciated regions of the world, like Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland, have rigorous landslide monitoring programs. They face their own threats. In Western Norway, for example, an array of instruments initially set up 20 years ago has been monitoring an unstable slope at a site called Åknes that, if it fails catastrophically, could produce a tsunami that would wipe out nearby communities.

	But in Alaska, where there are thousands of mountains and tens of thousands of glaciers that are unmonitored and have not even been named, and vast distances and remoteness pose daunting challenges. Scientists, agencies and communities have thus winnowed down their monitoring to the highest priority sites.
That leads to Prince William Sound.
The sound is the site of several communities. It is home to busy commercial and sport fisheries, and traversed by vessels ranging from kayaks and other small recreational watercrafts, to huge cargo ships and oil tankers. It is visited by hundreds of thousands of people who arrive by boat, train or vehicle each year.
On the northeast side, the main focus of landslide-monitoring is Barry Arm, a fjord about 30 miles from the closest coastal town of Whittier, where Barry Glacier has been receding.
Landslide-affected slopes around Barry Arm fjord are shown in this annotated 2020 map that uses a photograph taken by Gabriel Wolken, a state geological scientist. The prospect of a sudden collapse and large tsunami prompted scientists to issue an unusual warning. (Map provided by the U.S. Geological Survey)
The mountain slope there has been moving gradually for decades, since at least the 1930s, historic photographs show. In recent years, with drastic loss of Barry Glacier’s slope-supporting ice, the movement increased significantly, and there are already periodic slides. By 2020, there were episodes of movement reaching 2 meters in a 30-day period, and Barry Glacier’s retreat had exposed 600 million cubic yards of terrain, according to NASA, an amount six times the size of the 2015 Taan Fjord landslide.

	Those changes led to a dire warning from scientists that year: A catastrophic collapse of the slope could create a tsunami big enough to send a potentially fatal wave to the town of Whittier, 30 miles to the south and west. The scientists were so alarmed that they penned an open letter about the risks.
“This tsunami could impact areas frequented by tourists, fishing vessels and hunters (potentially hundreds of people at one time,” they wrote. “We believe that it is possible that this landslide-generated tsunami will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years.”

	The tsunami didn’t happen in 2020, but the risk remains. Whittier is home to about 275 people, most of whom live in a single high-rise condo building. But the small permanent population belies the town’s significance. It has a deepwater port that buzzes with activity, especially in the summer. Aside from its vessel traffic, it serves Alaska Railroad trains and a variety of vehicles that arrive through a one-of-a-kind single-land tunnel. Other vehicles depart from the Whittier harbor on Alaska Marine Highway ferries connecting the road system to the rest of the sound. 
The discoveries at Barry Arm mobilized what is now a state-of-the-art, federally funded monitoring program that has made the site one of the most instrumented mountain slopes in Alaska.

	Prior to that, West said, there were just “random university researchers or a good-hearted person at the state survey.”
Partners in the multiagency program include the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its National Weather Service, the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys and UAF and its Alaska Earthquake Center, among others.
Dennis Staley, a USGS scientist and Alaska landslide project leader, ticked off the equipment there.

The sensors can detect landslides as well as earthquakes, allowing the Alaska Earthquake Center to monitor both types of movements. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	The “backbone” is a set of tidal gauges installed by the National Weather Service’s National Tsunami Warning Center, Staley said.
Other equipment includes Alaska Earthquake Center seismic stations, which now serve the dual purposes of detecting earthquakes and detecting landslides. There is a ground-based radar system on the opposite side of the fjord to measure downslope movement. There are weather-tracking devices. There are infrasound devices that capture the sounds of rockfalls and other events. There are remote cameras to capture images over time. And new this year, Staley said, is an array of seismic devices at the top of the landslide area.

	Some of the Barry Arm instrumentation can gather information from wider areas, Staley said. Last year’s Surprise Inlet slides, for example, were captured by equipment set up at adjacent Barry Arm.
To maintain the system, scientists travel to the site at least monthly from May to October for tasks like battery replacement and a few times each winter, Staley said.
But Alaska conditions take a toll. The first seismometer installed in 2020 directly on Barry Arm’s landslide area was wiped out by a snow avalanche the following spring, he said.
Adjusting to risks
After the first year of on-site monitoring, scientists downgraded their predicted worst-case scenario of a complete slope collapse to from 30-foot wave at Whittier to a 7-foot wave hitting about half an hour after the landslide.

	That would still be dangerous, with a possible runup of over 500 meters on the opposite fjord wall and wave heights of over 200 meters in northern part of Barry Arm and over 5 meters in southern Barry Arm. Harriman Fjord, which is connected to Barry Arm, would be hit by a tsunami within 10 to 15 minutes of a big slide, scientists estimate.
Scientists have been providing periodic updates since the Barry Arm project started.
“Our job as federal scientists, government scientists, is to do our best to better understand what the actual hazard is, using the best available science, and then to make sure that we’re communicating about that hazard to the public,” Staley said.
In Whittier, people have adjusted their activities according to the risks they perceive.
A tour company that has trademarked its popular “26 Glacier Cruise” – even using an advertising jingle to do so — has reconfigured its itinerary to bypass the hazard area..

	Phillips Cruises & Tours still brings sightseers to 26 glaciers, but the trip offers a different mix than in past years, said Cody Hanna, the company’s vice president of marine operations. It is not sailing into Barry Arm anymore and, for now, the tour boats are also skipping Surprise Inlet and Surprise Glacier, though the latter has been a big draw for sightseers. Instead, the Phillips boats are taking a little more time on their tours and sailing a little farther out into the sound to a site called College Fjord, where there are multiple other glaciers, including the thinning but advancing Harvard Glacier.
“You can’t predict it, but it’s just grown enough to where it’s just not worth it anymore, so we’re back to Harvard Glacier and College Fjord,” Hanna said of the landslide risk.
Peter Denmark, owner of a kayak tour company, said he has also changed his operations because of landslide risks at Barry Arm. “We are not running any commercial tours up in that area, essentially due to liability concerns,” said Denmark, who also serves on Whittier’s city council and holds the position of vice mayor.
Barry Arm and the other landslide-prone sites around Prince William Sound and elsewhere keep him alert to the dangers, he added. “It is, personally, another hazard just from living in Alaska,” he said.

	Brenda Tolner, who has operated a waterfront shop in Whittier for more than 30 years, is less concerned.
If Barry Arm hasn’t caused a localized tsunami in the past, it probably will not do so now, she figures. “I don’t see it as any big threat,” she said.
She does not worry much about the slides in the nearby mountains because they have been happening for decades, she said. “You’ll hear the crash when they come down,” she said.
Tsunami awareness
In seismically active Alaska, people associate tsunamis with earthquakes. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, which was the second most powerful in the historical record killed 139 people, including 11 in Whittier. Most deaths were from the tsunamis that slammed against coastlines.
The 1964 earthquake has a profound legacy in Alaska. That includes preparations for future earthquake-generated tsunamis; several communities are designated by the NWS as “TsunamiReady,” with detailed safety systems to prepare for earthquake-generated tsunamis.

	There is also a history in Alaska of dangerous landslide-induced tsunamis. In Lituya Bay, an ellipse-shaped fjord cut into the Gulf of Alaska coast, a landslide shaken loose by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in 1958 triggered a megatsunami. It sent water 1,720 feet up a mountain slope and killed five people. Thirty-six years later, in 1994, a freak underwater slide in the Southeast Alaska town of Skagway caused a localized tsunami that killed a construction worker at a dock.
The slides and tsunami risk being studied in Prince William Sound are different.
They are caused not by earthquakes but long-term weakening of slopes that are no longer supported by glacier ice. A contributing factor sometimes is the thaw of high-altitude permafrost that binds slabs of rock together. Both changes are linked to long-term climate warming.
As glaciers at the bases of mountains rapidly retreat, they are de-buttressing, said Jillian Nicolazzo,  the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Survey’s landslide program coordinator.

	“So that the ice that had been holding all that rock in place is not there,” she said. “It’s too steep, so it has to find an equilibrium.”
The thawing high-altitude permafrost that contributes to slope weakness known as rock permafrost. Though lingering snow patches offer hints, it is hard to determine exactly how much of it exists on mountains or where it is located, Nicolazzo said. What is known is that it is sensitive to warming and implicated in landslides elsewhere.
“When that ice does start to melt, the space that it occupied becomes a void, and rock and soil fill that void,” she said.
Rain can be another trigger. Surprise Inlet’s landslides last year got their final push from heavy rainfall that loosened the already unstable slope, research shows.

	For residents, there is a pressing question: Can people be warned to evacuate from a landslide tsunami just as they are with earthquake-generated tsunamis, which can take hours to hit shores?
“Potentially, yes. The difficulty is you have to know that the landslide occurred and where it occurred, to start with,” Nicolazzo said. “We might be talking minutes, but it takes the scientists that long to triangulate where it came from,” Nicolazzo said.
Seismic signals are used to pinpoint locations. Scientists at the Alaska Earthquake Center can spot the differences between landslide seismic signals and earthquake signals. Earthquake signals are more varied in their frequencies and more sudden; landslide signals tend to be in low frequencies and are more gradual.

	The center’s seismic network proved vital in the Tracy Arm event, Nicolazzo said.
“They saw it pretty quickly and they were able to triangulate,” she said. “But the timing does make it difficult. The landslide happens, and then water starts moving.”
Good news, bad news
The downgrading of the severity of a Barry Arm collapse is a piece of good news that has come from the new monitoring. The bad news – as demonstrated by the Surprise Inlet landslides — is that there are numerous other Prince William Sound sites at risk.
A 2024 USGS study used satellite data to identify 43 sites in the sound where landslides occurred between 2016 and 2022. Fourteen were previously known. Eleven of the identified sites have potential for generating tsunamis.

	Rising to the top of that list is Maynard Mountain, said Gabriel Wolken, a geologist who heads the Division of Geophysical and Geological Surveys’ Climate and Cryosphere Hazards Program.
Maynard Mountain, through which the single-land Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel runs, looms directly over Whittier and a new cruise dock that started operations this year. Shrinking Learnard Glacier clings near the top, while rocks frequently tumble off its lower flanks.
Government agencies lack the resources to do a Barry Arm-like instrumentation and monitoring program, Wolken said. But what agency scientists can do is watch the mountain, whether from land or remotely through satellite imagery captured from space.

	“We did that at Barry Arm. We’ve learned a lot from that exercise,” Wolken said.
To better understand Maynard’s contours and landslide potential, the division was planning a survey of the mountain this fall using lidar, a technology that measures distance using light beams. This year’s planned lidar survey follows one performed at Maynard in 2022.
The probability of a tsunami-generating landslide at Maynard is considered to be very low, but the results if one were to happen would be “cataclysmic,” said Bretwood Higman, a Seldovia-based geologist who is part of the Woodwell Climate Research Center team.
“If a landslide failed catastrophically, you’ve got two minutes. There’s nothing you can do in two minutes, basically,” Higman said.

Lessons learned at Barry Arm are also being applied on the other side of the Whittier tunnel, where retreating Portage Glacier is exposing an unstable slope that is already the site of frequent rockslides.
As with Maynard Mountain, lidar surveys are planned at Portage, Wolken said. There are also plans for ice-penetrating radar surveys to better understand the glacier’s thickness and the characteristics of the bedrock below, he said.

Now the glacier has retreated so much that it is around the right corner, requiring a boat ride or mountain hike to see it in summer. A bit of Burns Glacier, which has also retreated dramatically, is visible from the visitor center. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	Higman, who spends a lot of time scouting the Portage Glacier area, said two slide areas by the melting glacier are combining to reshape the slope. “The very bottom of the slope is just falling apart and crumbling onto the glacier,” he said.
There is no permanent community at Portage Glacier, but the area is a popular destination for tourists and recreational users. For tourists, Portage Glacier’s retreat is part of the attraction. At the Forest Service’s Begich, Boggs Visitor Center, big windows that once provided close-up views of glacier ice now overlook open water. People wanting to see the namesake glacier must now hike up a mountain pass or boat across the lake or, in winter when the lake is frozen, ski or skate across it.
New device could provide communities with advanced warning 
Higman, who has experimented with a series of measuring devices at different Southcentral Alaska mountain sites, has come up with what he believes could be a valuable tool for community-based landslide safety.
It is a simple, glass-encased device using the type of radar signals that are employed on fishing boats. The devices send radio signals, “like a walkie-talkie,” through the internet to nearby databases. The goal is to detect changes in the slope. Since small movements precede big slides, the devices could give advance warning opportunities.

The devices use a simple radar system to measure slope movements that might precede landslides, and they are able to send signals by internet that can be recorded in a database. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	The devices promise to be more practical than other equipment Higman and his partners have positioned on various slopes, he said. They do not need to be embedded into holes dug into bedrock, as is necessary with some movement-measuring equipment. They are relatively cheap and easy to retrieve and replace, if needed. They could be managed by members of the public in affected communities. And they might avoid the problems with equipment he has installed at Columbia Glacier, a Prince William Sound landmark, where mountain goats have gnawed on or possibly eaten expensive communications and GPS devices.
Higman said he has nearly a dozen of the devices, and he has deployed them in a few places, mostly at Portage and at a Matanuska River Valley site called Glacier View, where a slide threatens a small subdivision.
It’s only a start, he said.
“I’m aiming for 100 sites. That’s what we need,” he said.

Beyond the sound
On the long list of landslide-prone glaciated areas is the coastal town of Seward, a popular tourist and recreation destination just outside of Prince William Sound on the Kenai Peninsula.
The town of 2,800 has recent experience with landslide-generated tsunamis.

	Last year, a section of mountain face fell into a marine site called Pedersen Lagoon, triggering a local tsunami that reached a height of about 56 feet. The Aug. 7, 2024, event did not injure anyone, but it damaged a private lodge’s wooden boardwalks and affected a Kenai Fjords National Park camping area. Previously, a 2022 landslide in Seward caused a small tsunami that was detected by equipment aboard the UAF-operated research vessel Sikuliaq.
Wolken, who loves to visit the picturesque coastal town with his family, laughed when asked if the precarious conditions of the slopes there dampens his enjoyment.
Family trips now to Seward are punctuated with safety lectures delivered to his two young daughters, and his watchfulness is constant, he said.
“I’m always looking at the slopes. I know the destruction that’s possible from gravity,” he said. “I don’t zone out. I’m always scanning.”

Just how many hazardous sites are out there? Bretwood “Hig” Higman, a geologist based in the Kenai Peninsula town of Seldovia, has done a basic inventory.
From 2012 to early this year, there have been more than 1,000 slow-moving slides of different varieties, with triggers that include receding glaciers, thawing permafrost, extreme weather or combinations of those factors, according to his calculations.

	In a state where people contend with earthquakes, floods, wildfires and erupting volcanoes, it may be difficult to add another type of natural disaster to the public’s list of worries, Higman said. But elevating landslide awareness and preparedness is necessary as events increase, he said.
“It is vastly more risky than most things we deal with,” said Higman, a partner in an Alaska landslide science program created by the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
Shallow, sudden slides triggered by rain
The lesson has been learned in Southeast Alaska, where catastrophic slope failures triggered by extreme rains have proved deadly. Since 2015, 12 people have been killed by landslides in Sitka, Haines, Wrangell and Ketchikan. Victims included an entire family of five killed by a sudden slide in Wrangell in late 2023.
In Southeast Alaska, steep mountains that were created through tectonic processes rise from the water’s edge, and rain is frequent. It is naturally susceptible to landslides.

	“One of the primary processes that sculps the landscape in southeast Alaska is landslides and glaciers and rivers,” said Dennis Staley, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist and Alaska landslide program leader. “When you combine rapid uplift with steep slopes with junky rock and lots of rainfall, you have all of the key ingredients for landslides.”
Southeast Alaska landslides are classified as shallow slides because they involve the soil, trees and other materials atop the bedrock rather than the rock itself. Those slides are numerous; the USGS recorded 162 news-reported slides in Southeast Alaska from 1990 to 2024. They are longstanding threats. A 1936 landslide in Juneau, for example, killed 15 people.
Now climate change is compounding the threat by creating more extreme rainfall events, driven by atmospheric rivers, as well as bringing more winter rain that, in other years, would be snowfall.
That means efforts to monitor landslide risks extend not just to topography studies but also the details about precipitation. Whether it is rain or snow – or rain-on-snow – has implications for slope stability, and the multiagency team studying landslide risks in Southeast Alaska has developed a prototype monitoring station to record precise qualities of the precipitation, as well as wind and temperature.

	Beyond federal and state agencies’ work and that of university organizations like the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, there is focused work by tribal governments and community organizations.
The Sitka Sound Science Center, previously known for its fisheries and ocean science work, now has one of the most well-developed landslide programs. The center’s landslide program was launched in 2015, after a slide there killed three. The center now maintains a local landslide hazards dashboard, and it participates in and coordinates a variety of research projects and educational programs.
One is the Kutí project, a partnership with the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska and other tribal partners. Named for the Lingit word meaning “weather,” the program is funded by a National Science Foundation grant awarded in 2022. The purpose is development of a more regional Southeast Alaska monitoring, warning and educational system.
The Sitka center’s work has been hampered by Trump administration budget cuts and policies. A landslide conference that the center was set to host last spring was canceled because Trump administration policies prevented federal partners from attending.
Permafrost thaw and frozen lobes

	Farther north, slopes are shifting and creeping as permafrost thaws, creating hazards for infrastructure. The best-known case may be in Interior Alaska at Denali National Park and Preserve, where one of the more than 140 detected landslides along the park’s sole road interfered with travel.
That slide, at a site called Pretty Rocks at the midpoint of the 92-mile road, had been ongoing for years, creating maintenance headaches for park staffers trying to keep the road open. In 2021, it finally made the road impassable there.
A project is underway to create a bridge over the slide area, but it is proving more complicated than originally envisioned. Early on, it was estimated to cost a bit under $100 million and expected to be completed by the 2025 tourist season. Since then, the completion date has been pushed back, with full road access expected to resume in 2027. The cost is now estimated at $150 million, a figure that does not include potential work at other landslide sites along the park’s road.
More than infrastructure at risk from Interior landslides. Last summer, when a guided rafting expedition encountered a landslide on the Nenana River just outside the park, a woman in the party was killed.
 

A frozen debris lobe in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve is seen in 2020. This lobe of frozen material was stable and nearly completely vegetated until about 2005, when it began to thaw and move downslope. (Photo provided by the National Park Service)
 

	Yet farther north, masses of frozen material are working their way down to the corridor that holds the trans-Alaska pipeline. University of Alaska Fairbanks and state scientists have identified more than 200 of them in the Brooks Range. As of last year, said UAF’s Margaret Darrow, there were 99 identified along the Dalton Highway, the road that parallels the trans-Alaska pipeline and the sole land route to the Prudhoe Bay oil complex.
The conglomeration of moving ice, water, crumbling rock and vegetation have their own descriptive name: “frozen debris lobes.” Darrow, the principal investigator on various UAF projects, began studying them in 2011, when she drove up the Dalton Highway for a two-family camping trip with a colleague.
The lobes, which move more quickly than thawing permafrost but are not causing sudden collapse, proved enough of a threat to the highway that the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities rerouted a section in 2018, part of a $25 million project that addressed thaw problems along the highway.
The reconfiguration proved necessary. The leftover section of highway was left in place as a test site, and the frozen debris lobe continued to flow. By late 2023, it had shoved the leftover highway section about a foot to the side, according to research led by Darrow.

	In the Arctic, in Alaska and elsewhere, permafrost thaw caused by warming temperatures has triggered widespread landslides known as retrogressive thaw slumps.
Among the affected sites is the Noatak Valley in mountainous Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, considered a hotpot for such slides. In that remote region, the safety of people and property is not much of an issue, but water quality can be. Numerous retrogressive thaw slumps have dumped tens of thousands of cubic meters of sediment into a single creek, according to the National Park Service.
Keeping abreast of the hazards from all types of unstable slopes in Alaska requires coordination by agencies at all levels of government, universities and other entities, said Jillian Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the state’s landslide hazards program.
“At the moment, we can’t do it all,” said Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the landslide program at the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. “Everyone pitches in a little bit, because it is just too much for any one agency.”

Addressing federal uncertainty
The state program gets funding from the USGS, and a big boost for U.S. landslide monitoring has been provided by the National Landslide Preparedness Act signed into law in 2021. Through that act, Congress in 2021 appropriated $4 million specifically to landslide hazards in Prince William Sound.
But the law, which authorized federal funding for landslide programs, expired in 2024.
Legislation is pending in Congress to reauthorize it, with sponsors from Alaska and Washington, states with deadly slides in recent years. One bill is sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington. Another is sponsored by U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Washington.
Without reauthorization, prospects for future funding are clouded.
The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year would cut funding for USGS natural hazards work – which includes landslide hazards – by about a quarter, from $203 million to $157 million, according to a Congressional Research Service report.
As with the canceled Sitka conference, Trump administration policy interrupted landslide work last spring in Prince William Sound. Massive federal layoff and spending freezes prevented some planned maintenance work at the Barry Arm landslide site.
If federal support for Alaska landslide monitoring becomes spotty, there is a potential backstop: citizen science.

	The Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys earlier this year launched an online app through which members of the public can report the landslide risks they encounter. Those could be actual slides, small rockfalls, cracks or anything unusual, and the division encourages people to submit photographs.
The hope is that important information will be gathered “if people are out hunting and fishing and recreating, especially if they see a lot of landslides that we don’t,” Nicolazzo said.
Without help from the public, scientists like her have to rely a lot on things like satellite imagery, she said. “I mostly sit at a computer and look at Google Earth. The images can be years old,” she said.
So far, the Alaska Landslide Reporter app has not been promoted or used much. But Nidolazzo is hopeful about its eventual utility.
Public awareness is, for now, the prime solution to the landslide problem in a place as big, mountainous, wild and fast-changing as Alaska, Nicolazzo said.
“I think educating people about the risk is the best we can do at this point. Because the area is so large and people are everywhere,” she said.

Years ago, I chose a defining fork in the road and applied to graduate school. As I anxiously awaited acceptance in the  University of Missouri-Columbia’s  School of Journalism, it was my good fortune to snag a summer job at the State Historical Society of Iowa in Iowa City.
As a northwestern Iowa native, living and working in clear view of the beautiful Old Capitol landmark broadened my sense of state history. Just think, in 1857 our fledging Legislature had the foresight to prioritize the creation of the State Historical Society of Iowa! As someone who loved both history and genealogy, the library at 402 Iowa Ave. was a treasure trove.
Today I live much closer to the State Historical Society of Iowa built in 1987 in Des Moines, and I was dismayed to learn in June of staffing cuts at both locations and the abrupt decision to shutter the Iowa City branch by 2026.
I should have seen it coming. Remember in 2023 when Gov. Kim Reynolds rammed through a reorganization of state government, reducing 37 cabinet level-agencies to 16? The State Historical Society of Iowa lost its autonomy, and was placed beneath the Department of Administrative Services, which received one-half of its requested funding this year. The Research Library requires only a miniscule portion of the budget, yet it was deemed a financial drain and “duplicative.”
Plans are underway to move 40% of the research library’s collection to Des Moines this month, but due to space constraints, a new home is being sought for the remainder.
The “Annals of Iowa,” an academic journal edited and published by the state for 163 years, also now is looking for a new home. Although it basically was self-supporting, the decision was justified as a staffing issue.
A Change.org Petition to Save Iowa History 2025 has garnered 7,008+ signatures to date.
Required whitewashing?
This history-making-headlines moment in Iowa is a bellwether for the current upheaval of our national history. In observance of our country’s 250th anniversary this year, the Trump administration wants the Smithsonian to “celebrate American exceptionalism” by “removing divisive or partisan narratives and restoring confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”
The Smithsonian Institute’s Board of Regents is being required to conduct an internal, comprehensive review of its exhibits and materials and “implement content corrections where necessary.”
The initiative takes aim at eight of the Smithsonian’s 21 museums. Additional museums will be included in a second phase.
Most troublesome is the Trump directive to remove “improper ideology.” Who will be the arbiter of “proper” ideology? Does this mean our history will be whitewashed?
In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated National Endowment for the Humanities grants to thousands of groups across the country including humanities councils, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, educators, and media outlets.
Fortunately, a federal judge has ruled that this abrupt elimination of grants previously approved by Congress was “unlawful” and that a lawsuit by humanities groups can move forward.
However, humanities councils still are operating without their congressionally appropriated funds, and many have already laid off staff and canceled vital programs.
In April, the beloved National History Day competition for high school students was jeopardized by these DOGE cuts. A social media funding campaign allowed the national competition in May to go forward. But the future of National History Day remains uncertain. Its 2026 theme is very timely: “Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History.”
Gaining a foothold in classrooms
Yet against this backdrop of iconic historical resources under siege, a new history exhibit, The Founders Museum, opened inside the Eisenhower Executive Building next door to the White House. It’s a partnership between the White House Task Force 250, the U.S. Dept. of Education, and PragerU.
Ever heard of PragerU? Me, neither. It’s not a university, any more than the University of Okoboji is. It’s a conservative nonprofit founded by conservative radio host Dennis Prager and an associate in 2009, and funded by very wealthy donors. Its business model is 5-minute edutainment videos covering an array of topics. It also has its own PragerU YouTube Channel.
You may recall the “America First” test adopted by Oklahoma to screen New York and California teacher applicants on their wokeness quotient? PragerU created the test.
The Founders Museum features 56 portraits of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, along with 40 AI-generated, animated short videos of these historical individuals telling stories — produced by PragerU. The intent is for these individuals, places, and events to come to life, making history engaging to Americans. No doubt it’s a worthy goal.
However, did President John Adams ever say, “Facts don’t care about your feelings?” Probably not, but his AI character does. Ben Shapiro, a prominent conservative commentator, has used it often, and it’s even become a meme.
Most of us aren’t experts in multiple fields, and therefore we don’t know all the facts. The facts we’re using as our filters and how we source them are critical components.
PragerU maintains that the Signers’ narratives are based on letters, speeches, and original writing. However, the issue goes beyond whether the animated stories are based on historical archives; PragerU’s carefully curated narratives raise the issue of which individuals integral to our history are being left out: People of color? Working class Americans? Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant to the U.S., didn’t sign the Declaration of Independence because he was with the Continental Army in New York at the time.
Another section, titled Ladies of the Revolution, raises my hackles; why not call it: Women of the Revolution? All ladies are women, but does this imply not all women are ladies? Mercy Otis Warren, a woman well ahead of her time, stridently criticized leaders at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention through her writings. She spoke truth to power. But her words seem watered down in her AI story.

Another section will feature 20 “Major Events,” but it appears incomplete.
The Founders Museum isn’t only available to tourists in Washington D.C. There are plans to take it on the road with mobile museum trucks during this Sesquicentennial year. Schools and state capitols will be encouraged to incorporate The Founders Museum in some way. (Oklahoma and Florida already have approved PragerU’s separate history initiative in their classrooms.)
History: What is it good for?
Why do we need history? Why do the archival resources that form the foundation of history matter?
Plainspoken former President Harry S. Truman once said, “The only thing new in the world is the history you don’t know.”
In fact, history offers lessons with uncanny applications to current events. For instance:
(1) At a Sept. 4 with Health and Human Services Secretary RFK, Jr. ,Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, presented a chart showing the positive impact of vaccine use in reducing and eliminating infectious diseases in the past century. She pointed out, “You’re basically trying to refute over 100 years of history on vaccines.”
(2) Why was the Insurrection Act passed in 1807 and why are we hearing about it today? How about the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878? The Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy military or federalize the National Guard against Americans in certain cases of emergency or rebellion. The primary exception to it is the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally bars the military from civilian law enforcement.
(3) Why did fluoridization of drinking water became widespread in the U.S. by 1960? It’s been hailed as one of the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century for its success in preventing tooth decay in children and tooth loss in adults, especially those in low-income families with limited access to dental care. Why is RFK, Jr. targeting it, with Utah and Florida following his lead to ban it, and other states proposing legislation?
(4) Why is the Civil Rights struggle such an integral part of our history? Florida’s revised K-12 curriculum teaches that some Black people benefited from slavery because it helped them develop useful skills. Could this partially illustrate why considerations of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion still are relevant after 250 years of U.S. history?
(5) Why should the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Labor Statistics remain independent? As Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, pointed out at confirmation hearing of Stephen Miran, this isn’t a theoretical argument. “We’ve actually seen this happen before when other countries with authoritarians take control of the central bank, working people suffer from higher inflation,” she said.
When Richard Nixon tried to paint a rosier picture of inflation and unemployment data, he wanted to purge Jewish members of the BLS because of unfounded bias. “There’s a Jewish cabal, you know, running through this…. ” he said. “But there’s the BLS staff. Now how the hell do you ever expect us to get anything from that staff, the raw data, let alone what the poor guys have to say [inaudible] that isn’t gonna be loaded against us? You understand?”
Is history history – will it become a victim of identity politics? History is not only the stuff between the covers of dry, dusty books. And history certainly isn’t the faux history bought and paid for by ideologues living in the lap of luxury. History is a living and breathing entity that humanizes us, binds us together as a nation, and impacts our daily lives. That’s something to celebrate in our 250th year!
If our leaders respect our history, and we the people scrutinize it, we can save ourselves from our worst human instincts. History doesn’t belong to one group of Americans, or one political party, or presidential administration. It belongs to us all. Indeed, history has its eyes on us.










Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive.


– Henry Steele Commager

Sinclair Inc., the parent company for Rhode Island’s WJAR, is taking over the infrastructure and operations for one of its rival market stations, ABC6 (WLNE), Jessica Bellucci, company spokesperson confirmed to Rhode Island Current on Friday morning.
The local market share agreement between Sinclair and ABC6’s parent company, Standard Media Group, lets Sinclair take over the equipment, operations and infrastructure for the second broadcast station, without changing the license ownership. The transaction closed Friday morning, Bellucci said.
“Sinclair is committed to producing distinctive content that delivers value and strengthens the connection to the local communities we serve,” Bellucci said in an email. “WJAR and WLNE represent the best of local broadcasting in the region, and we look forward to building on that legacy to continue to serve viewers across Southern New England.”
Bellucci declined to answer additional questions. 
However, beloved local  TV meteorologist Kelly Bates posted on social media Thursday that she and other ABC6 workers had lost their jobs due to the new agreement.
“It happened again,” Bates said in a Facebook video. “Our station was just bought by the station that I worked for previously and that parent company has decided I am a redundancy and needed to go.”
Bates spent most of her two-decade career at WJAR. She left the station in September 2021 amid a contract dispute, sparking outrage from Bates’ supporters, according to news reports. She returned to airwaves less than one year later, scooped up ABC6.
Standard Media Group  did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday. The company still listed ABC6 as one of its local stations on its website. 
The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training has not received any notices for layoffs at ABC6, Samuel Aboh, an agency spokesperson, confirmed Friday. Under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, companies are required to let state and local officials know in advance about mass layoffs or facility closures.
A non-license agreement lets the two stations bypass longstanding federal regulatory restrictions which seek to prevent monopolies in local broadcast markets. However, a single company owning two local stations, including licenses, might not be out of the question, either.
In July 2025, a federal appeals court threw out part of the Federal Communications Commission’s longstanding regulations that restricted ownership in a local broadcast market to no more than one station. Meanwhile, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, continues to push for further deregulation of broadcast regulation and ownership limits.

Gretchen Whitmer said the nation’s recent lagging jobs report and the uncertain nature of federal tariffs will be in focus during a speech planned next week.
The Democrat’s announcement also hinted that she’ll address Michigan’s stalled budget negotiations in what would be her first major public statement on the Legislature’s failure to put a spending plan in place. The current fiscal year ends Sept. 30, and the state government is facing an Oct. 1 shutdown.
Whitmer announced in a news release Wednesday that she will deliver an address to the state Tuesday. Her office said the governor would also touch on new troubling signs in America’s manufacturing sector.
All of that potentially bodes unwell for Michigan’s economy, and signals additional trouble for the nation’s economic status.
“Federal tariffs are driving economic uncertainly, leading to massive job loss, instability in our nation’s manufacturing sector, and concerning signs for our economic future,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Elected leaders need to set aside politics, do our jobs to protect and defend our constituents, and work together so we can create a bright future for every American. In Michigan, that includes passing a balanced, bipartisan budget that lowers costs, invests in education, healthcare, public safety, and roads. I look forward to laying out the stakes on Tuesday.”
Whitmer cited the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics current employment statistics preliminary national benchmark summary, and a report from the independent, bipartisan Center for American Progress. The latter asserts that President Donald Trump’s tariff trade war was squeezing middle-class manufacturing employment.
Whitmer’s speech will be delivered from the state capital in Lansing, but a time and location has not been announced.

After a summer characterized by masked federal agents detaining immigrants in Los Angeles, the California Legislature passed two measures Thursday that seek to force law enforcement officers to identify themselves.
Senate Bills 627 and 805 were among the most controversial to pass in the final days of this year’s legislative session. They would ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, as well as require officers to be readily identifiable, respectively. 

State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and lead author of SB 627: “As we go through this horrific era of mass deportation and a Supreme Court that allows this authoritarian regime to do whatever the heck it wants to do — including straight-up racial profiling of Latino people — California should lead and put a stop to the secret police.”

The measures passed along party lines, with Republicans in opposition. Police unions also oppose the proposed mask ban.

GOP Sen. Tony Strickland of Huntington Beach, in a statement: “This is a reckless anti-law enforcement proposal that puts law enforcement officers and their families at real risk, undermining the safety of the men and women who bravely protect our communities.”

Though today should be the last day of session, lawmakers are expected to extend their work through Saturday to give final votes to some last-minute deals they struck this week. Those that pass will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for his signature or veto, and those that don’t are dead for the year.
Other proposals awaiting Newsom’s decision, include: 

Regulate companion bots: SB 243 would put tighter regulations on online chatbots powered by artificial intelligence to limit their risks on young users.


Higher car dealer fees: SB 791 would raise the cap car dealers can charge to process documents from $85 to $260.


Wage boost for incarcerated firefighters: AB 247 would increase the minimum wage for incarcerated firefighters fighting active wildfires to $7.25 an hour.


Abortion pill protections: AB 260 would help protect California pharmacists, doctors and hospitals from penalties for dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone to out-of-state patients, and remove the names of patients and providers from abortion medication prescriptions.


Kill mute swans: AB 764 would make it easier for hunters and landowners to kill the invasive species.


Ban plastic glitter: AB 823 would enforce a first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of personal care products that contain plastic glitter or plastic microbeads.


Save the bees: AB 1042 would create a health program for managed honey bees that would provide grants to beekeepers, farmers and others for projects and research supporting the struggling population.

Google pulls the strings behind the scenes

As one of the top spenders in California lobbying last year, Google has poured millions of dollars to influence the state government. But its involvement in some proposals isn’t always clear-cut, underscoring the stealthy ways the tech giant goes about trying to shape policies, report CalMatters’ Khari Johnson and Yue Stella Yu.
It quietly orchestrated a campaign to water down a proposed California regulation, and it was so stealthy that lawmakers didn’t see the company’s fingerprints until CalMatters informed them.
In April the company began reaching out to small businesses using email lists, urging them to sign a petition opposing a measure that would require browsers to give users a way to automatically tell websites not to share their personal information with third parties. 
This outreach campaign, however, did not look like it came directly from Google, but rather the “Connected Commerce Council,” which Google backs financially. Google itself also never took a public position on the measure.
Though Google’s tactics aren’t illegal, it raises concern among some advocates who are critical of big tech’s influence.

Brandon Forester, an organizer for the nonprofit MediaJustice: “None of us wants to enter a surveillance marketplace every time that we go on the internet. Part of the reason they need to do the shadow lobbying is because the things that they want to do to achieve their infinite growth model is not good for the public.”

Less food, more solar

In stretches of the San Joaquin Valley that rarely get enough water to grow food, farmers and ranchers faced with barren, parched land have the opportunity to generate a new crop: solar energy. But a bill that aims to incentivize more farmers to install solar panels has farmers split, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
Under a 60-year-old law known as the Williamson Act, farmers can enter into contracts with local governments that allow them to pay less on their property tax as long as they use their land for farming. To cancel the contract before the end of its term results in steep penalty fees.
But AB 1156, if passed, would enable farmers to suspend contracts and avoid fees if they use their land to capture solar energy, although their property tax would still increase. The bill would help the state reach its clean energy goals since generating solar power requires hundreds of thousands of acres.
Though some farmers welcome an alternative use for their dried-out land, others argue that the bill undermines farming regions and chips away at the adjacent economies that help the agriculture industry operate.

,California,2025-09-12 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Mask bans in California create constitutional questions that are hard to answer,Stephen Routh,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/mask-bans-california/,Efforts to ban masks on protesters and to unmask law enforcement officers often balance competing societal priorities.,"Guest Commentary written by

Stephen Routh
Stephen Routh is a political science professor at California State University Stanislaus


California is starting to reach blue-flame-level political heat over two constitutional questions around mask wearing. 
Can local governments ban masks during public protests, as one Central Valley city did six years ago? The Modesto ordinance returned to the spotlight in June after several people protesting the immigration raids were arrested, prompting challenges from the ACLU and the NAACP. 
And should California prevent law enforcement officers from wearing masks while performing their duties? Lawmakers this week passed the No Secret Police Act, stemming from outrage over masked federal officers detaining individuals they believe are immigrants.
Ultimately resolving these questions involves balancing people’s right to safety with their right to express their views publicly. It’s a puzzle that’s more complex than it looks.
When a local government such as Modesto bans masks, at first glance it appears to be an understandable and legitimate policy to protect the public in large gatherings. It’s aimed at preventing or minimizing violent behavior by those who’d be emboldened to engage in it if their identity is cloaked. 
On the other hand, not allowing protesters to be anonymous harms their ability to protect themselves against retaliation from opponents, including government officials. Also, mask bans sweep in people wearing masks for medical or religious reasons.
In this light, mask prohibitions can be seen as unconstitutional intrusions on the rights of free speech and political association.
The First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” But it doesn’t mention freedom of association. The U.S. Supreme Court has decided freedom of association is implied from the explicitly stated rights of speech, press, assembly and petition, which together are called freedom of expression. 
The Constitution protects free expression — except if it incites lawless actions, is obscene, defames, defrauds or is part of a criminal conspiracy.
Any government that restricts protected expression must ensure the regulation is content-neutral, meaning it can’t vary based on its content or impact. The critical question about local mask bans is are they content-neutral or content-based? 
A complete ban on masks at demonstrations would seem, on its face, to indicate content neutrality if no single group or expression is being directly favored or disfavored. The Supreme Court would likely uphold it as constitutional.
What happens when government agents apply the law in a way that impacts certain groups of people differently, affecting who gets arrested for violating the ban and who feels chilled or hesitant about participating in a protest? Those with views that run contrary to the influential private actors or governmental officials are likely to mask up out of fear of retribution.  
What about protestors who, for medical reasons or religious beliefs, need to cover their faces? If a mask ban carves out exemptions for them, how would government officials ascertain who these people are in a public protest? 
Such selective or capricious enforcement of an otherwise constitutional law can render it illegitimate in the eyes of the Supreme Court, which may conclude that the mask ban contains content-based elements and is unconstitutional. 
Different constitutional concerns are at play with the ban on law enforcement masks the state Legislature approved. The ban would affect local police and federal officers, including ICE, Border Patrol and Homeland Security. 
It’s difficult to imagine the Supreme Court — whether it has a liberal or a conservative majority — allowing a state to micromanage or second guess federal law enforcement operations by not allowing government agents to mask up, especially while enforcing  immigration law, which the Constitution places under federal purview.
Since the earliest days of our republic, the Supreme Court has consistently reined in state efforts to constrain federal government endeavors. The court is acting on federalism principles in the Constitution: Federal law generally preempts state law or policy. 
The only plausible avenue California has to push back against federal face covering would be if Congress enacts such a law and the president signs it. That’s highly unlikely. The Trump administration says officers in ICE raids would face threats and doxxing if they weren’t masked.
Few constitutional issues arise if the potential anti-masking law is applied only to local police. The concern is more about policy and practice. Holding local officers accountable for their actions must be balanced against giving police discretion to make tactical and operational decisions.  
Distilled, mask bans create legal and societal issues that are tough to resolve at any time — but even more so now, as partisan battles brew daily amid aggressive exertions of federal and presidential power.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825_Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA_TS_CM_32.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936

Following an exceptionally dry summer, all of Utah is currently in drought — most of the state is in “severe” drought, while some desert regions are rated as “extreme.” A number of the state’s reservoirs are below 50% capacity with just two, Current Creek and Strawberry, above 85%. Great Salt Lake levels are veering back into dangerously low levels, while statewide precipitation data puts 2025 at far below the 10-year average.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has already issued a state of emergency related to the drought. Now, the federal government is announcing emergency loans, covering nine counties in Utah — Box Elder, Cache, Duchesne, Rich, Salt Lake, Summit, Utah, Wasatch and Weber — and three in Idaho — Bear Lake, Franklin and Oneida.
Now, small businesses, agricultural cooperatives, nurseries and private nonprofits (which include faith-based organizations) experiencing financial losses related to the drought can apply for assistance through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, administered by the Small Business Administration, or SBA. 
The SBA said in a news release that losses don’t have to be physical — the loans can be used to pay debts, payroll, accounts payable and other costs incurred due to the drought. 
“Through a declaration by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, SBA provides critical financial assistance to help communities recover,” Chris Stallings, associate administrator of the Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience at the SBA, said in a statement. “We’re pleased to offer loans to small businesses and private nonprofits impacted by these disasters.”

The loans can cover up to $2 million, with interest rates as low as 4% for small businesses, and 3.6% for private nonprofits, with terms up to 30 years. The interest does not accrue, and payments are not due until 12 months after they are distributed.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) will request a $5.6 billion budget for fiscal year 2027 to support programs like the Alabama Reading Initiative (ARI), English language learners (ELL) and speech pathologists.
The department plans to request $52 million to help coach struggling readers beyond third grade.  The department previously asked for the same amount and was granted $12 in supplemental funds.
The department originally requested $25 million for the program for fiscal year 2027, which starts on Oct. 1, 2026.
Alabama House passes $10 billion education budget

Tonya Chestnut, who represents District 5 on the board, said the department should ask for more.
“If we decrease it, are we really saying this is a priority or are we saying that we are trying to appeal to what we think the legislators want?” Chestnut asked during the meeting.
Chestnut proposed raising the request back to $52 million, based on a calculation from “if every struggling reader in every school got the same services” according to Alabama Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey.
“I feel that every child, regardless of where they’re located, should, if they need the support, have it available,” she said.
District 4 Representative Yvette Richardson said asking for more money would help address students who are in the gap due to Alabama Comprehensive Assessment Program (ACAP) testing.
“Because we started with $52 [million] at least ask for $52 [million] whether we get it or not because there may be some [students] that fell in between when we ended up giving the ACAP,” she said to Mackey.
The board decided to ask for the full $52 million and said they will negotiate with legislators to secure the funding.
ALSDE is also requesting additional funding for the High Needs Special Education Program for fiscal year 2027. The department is requesting an additional $3.4 million to be back to their original budget for the program.
The reason money for the program decreased for fiscal year 2026 is because it was reallocated.
“In the budget process, the legislature moved $3.4 million out of this line item to the new RAISE Act Special Education fund,” Mackey said to the board. “Districts are still getting it, but they’re getting it through the RAISE Act Special Education fund.”
The program, which was started by the board, uses the funds to ensure that students who need special assistance such as nurses or to be placed in a different school, have the resources they need.
The department will also request an additional $50.4 million for school safety. 
Mackey said the money will be used by the schools to get approved items outlined in the School Security Act including cameras, fencing, ballistic film to place on windows, weapons and metal detectors.
Another big ticket item that ALSDE proposed more funding for is assessments.
“We always ask for more money in student assessment because we’re always in the hole in student assessment,” Mackey said. “It’s a very expensive endeavor to do assessments and some of our most expensive assessments per child are not the ones we talk the most about.”
The board is proposing an $8.3 million increase in student assessments to bring their budget up to $28.8 million.
The board would use the additional money to improve the quality assurance of ACAP and virtual platforms for homeschooled students to test at home with their own devices.
ALSDE also wants to focus on expanding the career technical initiative. The board is requesting an additional $15 million be added to the budget for CTSO membership, grants, the expansion of career exploration to elementary and middle schools and expanding the Academy of Craft Training in Birmingham.
The board will vote on the budget on Oct. 9.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9616-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936
,California,2025-09-12 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Two years later, Californians still don’t know full impact of the $20 fast food wage",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/fast-food-minimum-wage-california/,"Fast food prices barely went up but jobs held steady after the wage increase, researchers in a union-friendly economic center wrote. But an industry-backed study said 19,000 jobs were lost.","As the California Legislature churns toward the end of its 2025 session this week, processing the remnants of thousands of bills introduced during the year, several measures encompass the Capitol’s most enduring conflict: Labor unions vs. employers over working conditions.
Unions seek higher wages and benefits, citing the welfare and financial needs of workers and their families. Employers counter that the cost of providing what unions want adversely affects their competitiveness in other states and nations and forces them to raise prices, reduce employment or even leave California to remain solvent.
In the main, unions fare better than employers in California’s political arena — not surprising given that union-friendly Democrats from the governor down dominate the Capitol.
One of the most intense union-employer battles arose in 2022 over legislation that would have raised the minimum wage for fast food workers to $22 an hour. It also declared that fast food franchises are merely subsidiaries of their parent chains, rather than independently owned businesses.
Fast food companies and franchisees saw it as a double whammy that not only would increase their costs but it would undermine the franchise system itself. The industry also disliked the bill’s creation of an appointed council with the power to regulate fast food working conditions, especially wages.
The measure passed both legislative houses with party-line votes, and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it. The industry responded with a campaign to put the issue on the ballot, pledging that affected corporations would spend any amount of money to overturn the law due to its effects on the franchise system.
Which faction would win such a battle will never be known, however, because a year after the bill was signed and after lengthy negotiations, a compromise was worked out and quickly enacted. It raised the minimum wage to an initial $20 an hour and left the oversight council intact, albeit with some changes. More importantly to the industry, it did not interfere with the franchise system.
The new wage went into effect in April 2024, and since then the industry and the unions have sparred over its impact not only on wages but on overall employment and fast food prices.
The factions are marking the second anniversary of the 2023 compromise by issuing reports that could not be more different.
Labor acted first with the September 5 release of an analysis by UC-Berkeley’s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. It’s a research organization whose reports uniformly support the union side of issues.
Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy declared that the $20 wage did not reduce fast food employment, didn’t change the number of hours worked and “only led to minimal menu price increases (about 8 cents on a $4 burger).” They said their study included price data from more than 2,000 restaurants in California and other states.
Five days later the Virginia-based Employment Policies Institute — which was created by Berman and Company, a lobbyist for restaurant, hotel beverage, tobacco and fossil fuel interests —  issued its study based on data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
It concluded that California’s fast food industry has lost 19,102 jobs since Newsom signed the law in September 2023, including 15,988 since the law went into effect last year, more than double the rate of loss seen in fast food outlets nationally. It did not delve into fast food prices.
The two competing studies from less-than-objective sources leave us still wondering what the true impact might have been. It’s a knowledge gap that should be filled by someone or something with impeccable credentials because other business sectors might be the next targets.
In fact, there’s already a battle in Los Angeles over the $30 wage for workers at hotels and other hospitality businesses imposed by the city council.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021825-Fast-Food-JH-AP-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936

LaMonica McIver is not automatically entitled to documents shared between federal officials about the charges she faces.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver speaks outside the federal courthouse in Newark on June 25, 2025, after she pleaded not guilty to charges related to a scuffle outside a Newark ICE jail. (Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)Lawyers representing Rep. LaMonica McIver in her federal criminal case are seeking emails, texts, and other documents probing government officials’ discussions of McIver’s party affiliations and policy views — but prosecutors refuse to hand them over, saying she failed to meet the high bar to obtain those records.
McIver (D-10) was indicted in June on three counts of interfering with federal law enforcement authorities during a scuffle outside a migrant detention center in Newark. McIver, who alleges that she is the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution by the Trump administration, is seeking communications from a host of federal officials, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
“As we hope is apparent, we have narrowly tailored our proposed scope of discovery to focus on evidence showing that the enforcement and charging decisions in this case were motivated by constitutionally impermissible factors,” Paul Fishman, McIver’s attorney, wrote in a Sept. 3 letter to prosecutors that was made public this week.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark McCarren and Benjamin Bleiberg told Fishman in a Sept. 9 letter that they will not provide the requested documents. They want the judge overseeing the case to rule on the matter.
“Discovery in support of selective prosecution and selective enforcement claims is not provided as a matter of right, and we do not believe your client has satisfied the applicable threshold evidentiary showings required … to compel discovery,” McCarren and Bleiberg said in their letter.
The charges against the congresswoman stem from a May 9 melee outside of Delaney Hall, the detention facility in Newark, that saw federal agents arrest Baraka, claiming he was trespassing. The arrest prompted a scrum as protestors moved to surround Baraka, a Democrat who claimed the jail was operating without proper city inspections and permits.
Authorities announced they were dropping the charges against Baraka days later — prompting a federal judge to admonish them — but moved to charge McIver the same day. The congresswoman and two other members of New Jersey’s House delegation, Reps. Rob Menendez (D-08) and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), were conducting an unannounced oversight visit at Delaney Hall on May 9, and McIver was among the people who surrounded Baraka as agents tried to arrest him.
In court filings, McIver said an agent was overheard that day saying he was going to arrest Baraka at the direction of the deputy U.S. attorney general. Todd Blanche, who holds that position, is among the officials from whom the congresswoman is seeking records.
McIver is also seeking federal officials’ communications about Baraka’s political affiliation and policy views. McIver’s discovery request seeks a range of communications between high-ranking and other involved officials in the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba and her staff.
McIver has in filings argued the charges against her are politically motivated, citing the government’s dismissal of charges against 160 individuals involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress who were charged with violating the same statute.
Alongside officials’ discussions of McIver and Baraka’s political affiliations, the congresswoman also wants communications about Jan. 6 defendants, procedures and policies related to congressional visits to immigration facilities, and officials’ compliance with a federal policy that requires the Department of Justice’s public integrity section to review potential charges against members of Congress.
Two U.S. Supreme Court cases — United States v. Armstrong and United States v. Bass — create a high bar for selective prosecution discovery requests. Generally, they must show that similarly situated defendants were not prosecuted because of an arbitrary classification.
Armstrong and Bass both involved allegations of selective prosecution based on the defendant’s race.
A separate case decided by the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals set a slightly lower bar for obtaining documents about selective enforcement by law enforcement agencies, rather than prosecutors, which allows judges to order limited discovery even when a defendant has not met the bar set in Armstrong and Bass.
District Court Judge Jamel Semper will decide what documents federal officials must disclose. It’s not clear when he’ll make that decision or whether he’ll call the parties to discuss it more fully.
House Republicans moved to censure McIver over her charges last week but were stymied after a handful of GOP members, along with all Democrats in the chamber, voted against the measure. Some other Republicans did not vote, and the censure was tabled by a 215-207 vote.

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/12/nonsensical-policy-targets-the-very-people-we-want-voting-in-elections-new-u-s-citizens/,"We should be falling over ourselves getting new U.S. citizens to vote, not punishing groups that make it easy for them to do so.","New U.S. citizens celebrate at a naturalization ceremony at Great Falls national park in Paterson in September 2019. Nonprofit groups that register new citizens to vote have recently been banned from these ceremonies by the Trump administration. (Photo courtesy of National Park Service)Last October, about 50 people became United States citizens during an annual ceremony at the Great Falls national park in Paterson.
The city’s mayor, Andre Sayegh, told me one of the newly minted citizens, a woman originally from the Dominican Republic, was excited to be presented with an application to register to vote.
“I’m glad you did this. I’m going to vote for Donald Trump,” she said, according to Sayegh.
The mayor relayed this anecdote to me this week to illustrate the idiocy of a new Trump administration policy barring nongovernmental entities from registering new citizens to vote at official naturalization ceremonies. This asinine decision from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will allow federal officials, the administration claims, to make sure only nonpartisan groups are registering new citizens to vote at events like the one held annually in Paterson.
The real reason, I suspect, is that groups like the League of Women Voters have performed this service, and conservatives believe that group has morphed from a little-old-ladies-hosting-debates organization into one led by fire-breathing lefties intent on electing Democrats. I know many of the people at the League of Women Voters, and I don’t doubt there are progressive members — but the group is also sincerely interested in boosting voter participation, no matter the party.
If you want proof, look at the partnership the league had with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the past, even under the first Trump administration. Melissa Marks, who works at the league’s New Jersey chapter, said the group was even able to store voter registration materials in a closet at the federal agency’s Cranbury office.
“We see ourselves as helping them, as providing a service for them and making sure that their clients, these new citizens, are invited to participate in democracy from day one,” she said.
The Trump administration will probably not change course here, which means it’s incumbent on our state and local governments to fill in the gap.
Sayegh told me he’d love for Paterson to step in and perform this service — but the annual Great Falls naturalization ceremonies have been canceled in a move he thinks is related to cost-cutting at the National Park Service, which runs the park and has lost a quarter of its staff this year, according to the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association.
“I guess they got DOGE’d,” Sayegh said.
A federal building in Newark is also home to regular naturalization ceremonies. Its mayor, Ras Baraka, said through a spokeswoman that he intends to have city officials step in where the League of Women Voters and other groups are being told to stand down.
“Voting is fundamental to being an American and participating in our democracy, so it’s incumbent upon us to ensure all Newarkers have easy access to voter registration. We can, and will, work with our partners to continue to register voters, including our newest citizens, so that each of us has an equally strong voice in the future of our city, our state and our nation,” Baraka said.
So maybe some cities will indeed help here. But will they be allowed to? Marks told me their partnership with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services required a ton of communication to coordinate — will the same Trump administration that is suing places like Paterson over their sanctuary city orders feel like calling Sayegh’s office to make sure he has city officials at naturalization ceremonies to get new citizens on the voter rolls? Seems unlikely.
What’s truly nonsensical about this revamped policy is new U.S. citizens are exactly the kinds of people we want voting in elections. By all accounts, our immigration system places myriad hurdles between an immigrant and their naturalization papers. Someone who jumps over all those hurdles is committed to being a citizen, and probably more civically minded than even some of us who were born on American soil. We shouldn’t simply tell them, “Here’s how you can register to vote.” We should put the application in front of them and say, “You can register to vote right now.”
A strong democracy is one where we are empowering our eligible voters to participate, not one that creates burdens and extra barriers to do so. That’s what this new policy does.

(Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A South Carolina legislator wants to hear from state universities about safety protocols for campus events following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University this week.
Representatives from state law enforcement, the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, the College of Charleston and Coastal Carolina University will speak to members of the state House higher education subcommittee on Tuesday. The state’s historically Black colleges and universities also have been invited.
“I just want to make sure our colleges are ready and as prepared as we can be for something that’s unimaginable,” the subcommittee’s chairman, GOP Rep. Tim McGinnis of Myrtle Beach, told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday.
Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions, was speaking at the college in Orem, Utah, on Wednesday as part of his “American Comeback” tour debating with students on college campuses.
At about 12:20 p.m., Kirk was shot in the neck while speaking to the crowd of about 3,000 people, Utah Valley University police have said.
Kirk was then taken by a private vehicle to Timpanogos Regional Hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason.
The manhunt for the shooter continues.
Kirk held one of his signature “prove me wrong” events at USC on April 7, when hundreds of students gathered outside the Russell House student center — despite the rain — for the chance to debate him and hear his answers.
USC student event featuring Proud Boys founder draws small protests, no violence

The campus also has played host to other controversial speakers, including Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and podcast host Myron Gaines, criticized for his misogynistic views.
Each of those events drew protests but no reports of violence on the USC campus.
But in light of Kirk’s assassination on Wednesday, plus a series of unrelated, unspecified threats that went out to HBCUs across the Southeast on Thursday, McGinnis said he wanted to check in with colleges in the state to hear any concerns or security needs they may have.
“Until now it hasn’t really come up and now it has,” he said.
With two college-age kids of his own, McGinnis said it’s important to maintain the free flow of ideas and speech on college campuses while also keeping people safe from harm.
“It doesn’t matter who is speaking about what. I just want everybody to feel safe on our college campuses,” McGinnis said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/russell-house-1024x762.jpg,,,2025-09-12 07:56:50.153359

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Our country has been testing a promising strategy over the past several years: providing cash directly to families. 
The most prominent examples are the (since canceled) expanded child tax credit under President Joe Biden; Minnesota’s child tax credit passed in 2023; and the guaranteed income programs being piloted in cities across the country, including in St. Paul. 
The promise of this approach is in part the potential benefits for children. Several decades of research have suggested that increasing the income of low-income families could improve educational and developmental outcomes for children.
However, a recent study throws some cold water on that prospect. 
The study is called Baby’s First Years. It examines four guaranteed income experiments (including the site in St. Paul, Minnesota) in which low-income families received $400 a month as part of the experiment. The BFY study selected newborn children at the beginning of the project and then measured the children at age 4. The study examined the 4-year olds on outcomes like language, social-emotional development and executive function. 
The researchers found no differences between the kids in families that got $400 a month and kids in control group families that got only $20 per month. 
The extra cash the families received – $16,000 over four years – appears to have had no impact on child development.  
There may be mitigating factors in these findings, most notably the pandemic, and specifically pandemic policies that provided more cash and other enhanced benefits to all families (while probably exacerbating inflation). In other words, those families in the control group receiving $20 actually received more from other sources during the pandemic, so we can’t be sure of the differences between the two groups. 
These factors could have diminished the impact of the extra cash provided through the experiment. 
But it is hard to simply write off or ignore this study; it’s a gold standard research design and a top set of researchers. 
This is not the last word, of course. Predictably, the researchers call for more research. A follow-up with the children at age 6 is already planned. Outcomes can change based on age. 
But it is disappointing. 
Improving the lives — and life chances — of children in low-income families is one of our nation’s most vexing problems. This is a setback.
Studies that provide unexpected — and, to many, unwelcome — findings can create a backlash. Why bother investing in research if it might support disinvestment in our preferred causes? 
Ideology has a way of coloring how we view research. 
We need to resist that temptation. Public policy is at its best when it is formulated based on quality research and reinforced by continuous learning. 
If we care about the people we are trying to help, we need to invest in solutions that are proven to work.  
But in the real world, tons of public investments are made with little or no proof of effectiveness. Demanding proof can feel like unilateral disarmament. 
This is especially true when research is weaponized by opponents to a policy, as happened in this case. Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a long-time opponent of anti-poverty programs, told the New York Times that the BFY study, “blows the arguments for unconditional cash aid out of the water.”
It doesn’t. It raises questions about one of the anticipated benefits of such programs. 
I don’t think this study is a reason to stop efforts like expanding the child tax credit and experimenting with guaranteed income. 
Why? Well, first and foremost we should stop ignoring the basic reality that we have a service economy with many low-wage and part-time jobs. Parents working full-time or multiple jobs can’t make ends meet. 
Providing direct cash assistance is simply a recognition of that reality. 
And, as I wrote in in this space in 2023, there is little evidence that such policies discourage work. 
Moreover, previous research on the guaranteed income programs found other benefits for families, such as increased financial security, increased food security, more parenting time, more money spent on child activities, and in some cases increased employment. 
These are all meaningful improvements in the lives of families that should stand on their own in support of the efficacy of cash aid.   
The advantage of cash aid is that it is flexible — it allows each family to address their own most critical needs.  
That flexibility may help families manage two escalating cost pressures: housing and child care. 
Our direct efforts to improve the affordability of housing and child care have been, at best, inadequate. Why not just give families cash?
It is also far easier and less costly to administer direct cash aid than targeted benefits like SNAP and housing subsidies. As we’ve seen with the child tax credit, cash aid can be built right into the tax system. 
While I don’t believe the BFY study is, by itself, a reason to stop efforts to provide direct cash aid to families, it does raise questions about how we adjust our strategies for supporting disadvantaged kids. 
Investments in proven direct services for children, like early childhood education and quality child care, should be a continuing priority. 
You know what else? More research. 
Because we owe it to kids to use scarce funding for programs that make a real difference in their lives.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NN200715NeighborhoodWatch615-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 07:56:50.153359

(Getty Images)It’s no secret that Indiana’s voting performance is abysmal. Hoosiers have no problem registering to vote but often don’t make it to the polls.
That’s why I was intrigued by a meeting on two election proposals — moving municipal elections to even-numbered years and expanding vote centers to all counties — held in Indianapolis last week.
Lawmakers mandated that Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales host a series of meetings on the ideas and provide a report for possible action in the 2026 legislative session.
Increasing voter turnout should be everyone’s goal. To me, the vote center proposal is an easy yes.
Instead of having dozens of precinct locations scattered across a county with voters assigned to only one, officials set up a handful of large locations that anyone can use regardless of where they live.

The model is used in 67 of Indiana’s 92 counties. It costs less and requires less staffing. The latter is important as many longtime poll workers age and can no longer volunteer.
Boone County, where I live, moved to vote centers in 2014. It was a smooth transition and has been a welcome change. I have voted in Lebanon on my way to the grocery store or in Whitestown on my way to work. I’m not pinned to only one location — I can fit voting within my day more easily.
I have never waited more than 15 minutes. Counties still need to provide enough machines to avoid long lines, though, and they shouldn’t skimp and set up too few vote centers.
Indiana law requires at least one vote center location per 10,000 voters but I consider that a minimum and believe officials should plan for more than that.
Allen County is the largest that doesn’t use vote centers, but officials there are in discussions to change that. They have 110 polling locations, which would be consolidated into 53 — or one for every 5,000 voters.
A vote is planned for Sept. 15 and must be unanimous.
The second proposal Morales is studying isn’t ready for prime time: moving municipal elections to even-numbered years alongside major races such as president, the U.S. House and Senate, governor, other statewide offices and the Indiana House and Senate.

The data is clear that turnout is much lower in municipal races.
In 2023, for example, turnout in Indiana’s municipal elections was about 27% statewide. That compared with roughly 42% voter participation in the 2022 midterm elections and 61% in the 2020 presidential election.
But that isn’t the whole picture.
Right now, your mayoral race or city council contests are the focus of that election cycle. Candidates, news media and voters can focus on local issues, from growth strategies and road funding to zoning issues and crime.
But if you add those to an already busy ballot, those races will be buried behind federal and state politics. If voters make it all the way through those races — and that’s a big if — they will be without the benefit of a sustained and direct season focusing only on local matters.
Local races in recent years have gained real importance, whether it be related to controversial data centers or solar panel farms. People are paying attention, and I would hate to see that jeopardized.
While those are the only two proposals under consideration, I did want to mention a few other election changes that have been passed in other states to make elections more efficient and flexible for voters.

Extended voting hours. Indiana’s polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Election Day and I think that’s plenty. Especially since Hoosiers have four weeks beforehand to cast an early vote in person at the county courthouse or other satellite location, there is plenty of time for people to vote.
Same-day registration. Indiana had 4.8 million registered voters for the 2024 general election, while the state has a total population 0f 6.9 milliion. And of course, some residents aren’t old enough to vote. I personally don’t think registration is issue. The problem is getting people to the polls. This change would be a heavy lift for no real improvement.
Ranked-choice voting. Some jurisdictions are adopting this and have seen turnout increases of between five and seven percentage points. This option allows voters to rank candidates for an office in order of their preference. If a candidate receives more than half of the first choices, that candidate wins, just like in any other election. However, if there is no majority winner after counting the first choices, the race is decided by an instant runoff. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who ranked that candidate as their first choice will have their votes count for their next choice. This process continues until a majority winner, a candidate with more than half of the vote, wins. It’s complicated and I don’t think Hoosiers are ready for it.

I wish I knew the answer to getting more voters to go to the polls. I understand frustration over House and Senate districts, which people may feel are predetermined by gerrymandered maps.
But most races are statewide and local, where every vote absolutely counts.

Following days of speculation about his health from users on social media, President Trump made his first public appearance in a week to announce the moving of Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Alabama (Alex Wong/Getty Images).This column departs from my normal subject of Missouri statehouse issues.
It reflects my concern that Donald Trump’s actions against foreign students could obstruct educational opportunities for students to better understand what is so special about journalism in the U.S. compared with other countries.
One of my objectives as founder of MU’s State Government Reporting Program was to help my international students understand their reporting powers in the U.S. because of the significant freedoms, court protections and just as importantly the importance of professional standards for journalism in the U.S.
It was a two-way street because from my student discussions with my international students from less-free countries, my American journalism students gained a better appreciation of the legal protections in the U.S. and journalism standards that make our country so special.
By way of background, for many years, in addition to hosting journalism students from other countries to cover Missouri’s state house with my American students, I also conducted international workshops for journalists around the world.
The subsequent positive feedback from my foreign students and foreign journalists have reminded me of President Ronald Reagan’s 1989 farewell address describing the Capital as the “shining city upon a hill” which he credited to an earlier phrase by John Winthrop who used the phrase to refer to the Massachusetts Bay Colony where he had been governor.
For many of my state house students, I sensed that Missouri’s state house was “shining light upon a hill” because of the open debates among public officials my students covered including the consequences for misbehavior by public officials to major policy debates and learning about the right for state house journalists to report those stories.
I fear the Trump administration’s action against foreigners in our country could have a profound impact on that understanding by both foreign journalism students and U.S. journalism students about the importance for journalism from the legal protections from federal court decisions.
One of the best examples of legal protection came in 1964 when the U.S. Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibited lawsuits against public figures without proof of malice — defined as knowledge that the outlet knew the information was false or acted in reckless disregard as to whether the information was true or not.
Although a major victory for journalists, the lawsuit actually involved an advertisement in the New York Times from a civil rights organization, not a news story.
Another example from the Supreme Court came later in 1971 when the court upheld the right of the New York Times to publish classified documents from a government source that outlined the complicated history of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war.
I now fear that the actions of President Donald Trump and his administration could undermine what I sought to inspire in my international journalism students and professionals about the “shining light” of U.S. freedoms that empower U.S. journalists and the public’s right to know as well as the standards of my profession.
In fact, I wonder how students from other countries would react to that phrase “shining light” for a city now patrolled by military troops with military gear, vehicles and weapons.
If I still were an active journalism faculty member, the current actions by Trump’s administration might make me hesitant to sponsor international students to Missouri, knowing they could be subject to arrest or removal without judicial review.
I suspect many faculty from other countries with whom I worked also may have second thoughts about sending their students to the U.S. because of the financial cost and educational disruption for a foreign student being barred from continuing academic study in the U.S.
Discontinuing these exchange programs would be a loss not only for foreign students but also for U.S. students who learned from my foreign students about how special are the rights and standards for journalists in the United States, as well as the issues U.S. students could face when reporting in other countries.
On a more positive note, U.S. courts have become more forceful, ordering judicial reviews before deportation and restricting recent administration actions against persons from other countries.
So, maybe future students from other countries will appreciate Ronald Reagan’s expression of the nation’s capital as “a shining light.”
By way of background, for many years, in addition to hosting journalism students from other countries to cover Missouri’s state house with my American students, I also conducted international workshops for journalists from around the world in which I stressed U.S. legal protections for journalists but also U.S. journalism standards.
In less-free countries, I sensed journalists were inspired about the legal freedom and, just as importantly, the professional journalism standards in the U.S.
I also must confess a family history because my mother’s parents in Torrance California volunteered to maintain the local nursery of a Torrance Japanese family after they were forced to an internment camp under the Alien Enemy Act during WWII until the family was released and returned to their home.
The Alien Enemy Act, now used by Trump, was invoked during WWII to intern thousands of U.S. citizens of German, Japanese and Italian origin.
The actions of my grandparents and my dad’s WWII service remain a deep inspiration for me.
If you want to know more about the Japanese internments, search the web site of Manzanar at https://www.nps.gov/manz/index.htm.
Having climbed and backpacked from my father’s original birth-home to that area to the top of the Sierra
Nevada overlooking Manzanar decades after the internments, I can vouch for the website’s photos of how harsh was the desert environment and the oppressive heat.
Also, check out “They Called Us Enemy” by George Takei and others about his internment because of his Japanese ancestry. He starred as Sulu in the TV show Star Trek.
On the other side, President Roosevelt’s invocation of the Alien Enemy Act came after a Japanese submarine attack on the California coast.
And some of my relatives told me about growing resentment from some in Californian had about the growing Japanese immigration into the state.
My relatives obviously did not agree with that resentment and, in fact, helped me better understand the contributions of Japanese to my state’s growth and history.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trumpsept22025_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 07:56:50.153359

(Charles Jischke/Purdue University)The nation’s largest scientific research funder abruptly canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants earlier this year, specifically targeting projects that addressed diversity, inclusion or vaccines.
Combined, the 21 grants across four Indiana higher education institutions total $24.5 million in federal dollars from the National Institutes of Health, as detailed by Grant Witness, an independent tracking effort. The project partly relies on self-submitted cancellations, meaning the losses could be higher.


An additional $15.5 million in grants to Indiana schools under the National Science Foundation was canceled. Under that program:

Indiana University’s Bloomington campus lost $6.2 million


Ivy Tech Community College lost $238,000


Purdue University lost $8.3 million and


Notre Dame University lost $642,000



More than half of the canceled project dollars from the NIH, or $14.3 million, were dedicated to projects at Indiana University in Indianapolis, specifically the School of Medicine. University officials didn’t respond to emails or phone calls requesting comment.
Purdue University lost nearly $6.2 million, followed by Notre Dame University’s $3.2 million. Indiana University’s main campus in Bloomington had just three projects for a combined $641,000 — but two of those projects may be restored following legal battles. 
One of those includes a five-year project to increase condom use among adolescent boys who are gay, bisexual and queer. The digital education program focuses on affirmative consent, identifying coercion and communicating with partners about desires and boundaries, according to an IU press release from earlier this year. 
“Oftentimes adolescents don’t know how to ask to use condoms. They feel awkward talking about it to their partner because it implies they don’t trust them, so they don’t take that risk because they want to keep the peace in the relationship and maintain harmony,” researcher Hannah Javidi said in March. “But they are putting themselves at risk by doing that, so we want to build up that confidence and have them feel comfortable advocating for the use of a condom, as well as refusing unwanted sexual activity or ending a sexual encounter halfway through if they decide they aren’t feeling it — all of which I see as a part of consent.”
At the time, Javidi said she hoped to roll out an updated version of the program in the fall. 
Ten days after that release, NIH canceled the project. According to Grant Witness, just $35,000 remained of the $196,000 allocated in this round of funding. That budget was potentially restored following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the American Public Health Association, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and Ibis Reproductive Health. 
The ACLU of Massachusetts, which spearheaded the legal battle, got a district court to rule in their favor in June, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed course in August in a narrowly divided ruling. 
It’s unclear where that puts Javidi’s project and another IU Bloomington effort, which analyzed the effectiveness of pop-up clinics in diabetes prevention for rural, Hispanic Hoosiers. Both were part of the ACLU suit, according to Grant Witness. 
A separate Purdue project, which started in 2020 to study COVID-19 vaccines, was potentially reinstated in a separate lawsuit filed by several Democrat-led states. That lawsuit focused on projects with appropriations from various COVID-19 laws.
A KFF Health News story found that blue states, many of which filed lawsuits challenging the cancelled NIH grants, were more likely to see reinstated funding — meaning that red states like Indiana that didn’t challenge the move lost out.
 The canceled projects

Submitted projects spanned the gamut, from kidney disease and substance abuse prevention to studying pediatric cochlear implant users and preparing minority undergraduate students for rigorous research programs. 
In all, four projects sought to either support underrepresented minority groups in their education or combat sexual harassment. These studies were flagged for including specific references to gender, sex, race, inequality, inclusivity or diversity in their projects. 
Several of the projects sought to build upon prior studies, adding to ongoing treatment research. These studies include a $2 million award to University of Notre Dame chemistry professor Juan Del Valle, who is studying a type of molecule bonding common in certain Alzheimer’s patients and finding ways to selectively disrupt it. His colleague Mayland Chang received an award for $771,000 to study an aspect of Clostridioides difficile, or c-diff, infections. The deadly bacteria doesn’t have an antibiotic treatment and kills thousands of Americans every year.


“The NIH is an important partner in helping to advance critical research at the University of Notre Dame — research aimed at fostering new discoveries in the biomedical sciences and health that contribute to the common good,” a Notre Dame spokesperson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “Recently, the agency updated its mission and priorities in alignment with the new administration. As a recipient of NIH funding, we are actively monitoring the situation and working to understand the impact thus far.”
The school noted that two other projects weren’t included in the Grant Witness database, meaning their total grant loss was closer to $4.7 million, not $3.2 million.
Del Valle’s research was flagged by the NIH for the words “trans” and “diverse,” according to Grant Witness. The project’s abstract refers to cellular transmission at various points and “diverse modes of b-sheet packing.” Chang’s research, on the other hand, doesn’t have any flagged words. 
The use of the word “barrier” might have sunk a $5.7-million Indiana University School of Medicine glaucoma study. Professor Jason Meyer, a molecular geneticist, sought to identify ways to replace certain cells within the eye’s nerve that are damaged by glaucoma, which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. 
His project’s title? “Overcoming barriers to retinal ganglion cell replacement in experimental glaucoma.”

Another biochemistry study was flagged because of its focus on triple-negative breast cancer, which researchers identified as “the deadliest form of breast cancer, (affecting) Black/African American women at twice the rate of white women.”
The team identified a certain type of enzyme — Adensine Deaminase Acting on RNA, or ADAR — required to grow these cancer cells and sought to explore potential treatment avenues.
“This work will advance our understanding of ADAR- dependency such that we can accurately classify ADAR-dependent (triple-negative breast cancer), thus opening the door to treating this deadly form of breast cancer…” the study’s abstract reads.”Developing an effective targeted therapy for (triple-negative breast cancer) is essential to reducing the disparate effects of this disease on Black/African American women.”
However, many research projects are still ongoing. A Sept. 5 research update from Purdue University notes that 97% of its $1 billion in research funding “remains intact.” Additionally, the school reported receiving $74.9 million in grants in July, a 20% increase from the previous fiscal year.
NIH grants do more than provide funding. For students and researchers breaking into their respective fields of study, these dollars also support the next generation.
Speaking about his mentee’s grant to study the relationship between substance use and chronic pain, Indiana University’s Patrick Quinn praised Alynna Summit’s NIH award that would “jumpstart” her academic career. Summit received a two-year fellowship grant totaling $97,948 last September. She already spent the first year of funding, but the second year has been canceled.
“It’s designed as a launching pad for a research career and so it also offers really great training opportunities to get Alynna to the next stage,” said Quinn. “It isn’t just about Alynna developing out a research project to pull apart these two subjects that hang together in ways we don’t fully understand, but also to think about what resources Alynna will need to set her up for success in her career.”

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State StandardTACOMA — A former Washington state worker who admitted to embezzling nearly $900,000 in taxpayer funding to finance his gambling addiction was sentenced Thursday to 18 months in federal prison. 
Matthew Ping, an ex-employee at the Office of Administrative Hearings, will also need to pay $1.1 million in restitution for the money he stole and unpaid taxes on it.
Before the fraud case, Ping filed for personal bankruptcy four times, in 1999, 2005, 2012 and 2018, court records show. In the 2018 bankruptcy, the year before his embezzlement began, Ping reported $190,000 in debt.
A state audit found the office’s internal controls to prevent the type of fraud Ping carried out were inadequate. 
Ping, 48, had worked at the state agency since 2009. 
In May 2019, Ping reportedly received about $4,900 in salary payments from the Office of Administrative Hearings, which handles disputes between state and local government agencies and residents. That month, he withdrew at least $3,800 at western Washington casinos. By the end of the month, his checking account was overdrawn.
The next month he began stealing public money, according to court papers. 
As a management analyst, Ping had an agency credit card, and was the only employee with access to the office’s bank statements, according to court papers. His salary in 2022 was $82,500, according to Washington’s payroll database. 
The defendant set up a fake company, called RCC Professional, to funnel money from his work card directly to his personal bank account, according to court documents. The payments would appear on bank statements like legitimate transactions.
Between 2019 and 2023, Ping used this scheme to steal nearly $861,000. Over this time, he created three other fictitious businesses to hide his fraud, according to court documents. He also reportedly used his agency credit card to make $17,000 more in personal purchases.
Ping’s public defender, Lindsay McCaslin, acknowledged “of course he should’ve stopped.”
“But addiction is compulsive, by definition,” she said in court Thursday, adding that treatment resources for gambling addiction are minimal compared to other disorders.
Ping spoke in court, as well, noting he called a gambling hotline, only to be directed to a local clinic with a 13-week wait for an appointment. Ping has now been getting treatment for months and hasn’t gambled for over a year, he added.
Ping apologized for his actions in court.
“From the bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry for the hurt that my actions have caused and I take full responsibility for them,” he said, and referring to his coworkers, added “the shame I feel for hurting them will never go away.”
The fraud was the largest state agency misappropriation in at least 15 years, according to state Auditor Pat McCarthy.
He used the money for at least a half-dozen trips to Las Vegas and to pay off a loan for a used Mercedes-Benz, prosecutors say. Casinos comped Ping’s hotel rooms in Las Vegas, his attorney said.
At the height of his gambling, Ping received many such perks, including sports game and concert tickets and thousands of dollars in free play per week, he said. 
Ping didn’t report any of his newfound wealth on federal tax returns, resulting in a $240,000 tax loss. 
Federal prosecutor Dane Westermeyer noted in court Thursday that the defendant was paid to work while embezzling, on top of his fraud and unpaid taxes.
“Mr. Ping effectively stole from Washingtonians three times over,” Westermeyer said.
Ping took a number of steps to further circumvent the agency’s policies for approving credit card transactions, so his fraud would go unnoticed.
The years of theft were only discovered when state auditors launched a normal audit of his office and asked questions about his fraudulent payments. He resigned in summer 2023.
Ping pleaded guilty to wire fraud and filing a false tax return in June of this year. Under federal sentencing guidelines, he faced 37 to 46 months in prison. 
Prosecutors asked U.S. District Court Judge Tiffany Cartwright to sentence Ping to 2 ¾ years, a prison term below the standard range, followed by three years of probation. The defense requested no prison time, instead pushing for five years of probation and a year of electronic home monitoring.
Cartwright decided on a middle ground, noting the way Ping’s addiction consumed him while also weighing how a prison sentence could serve as a deterrent for future offenders.
“I really hope you can find a way to tell your story about how you ended up in this place that can be helpful to others,” the judge told Ping.

Insurance covered $628,000 of the Office of Administrative Hearing’s losses, so that portion of restitution will go to the insurer. 
After the state audit uncovered deficiencies in the office’s oversight of credit card payments, the agency committed to implementing a number of new safeguards. That included giving several employees access to credit card statements and requiring more documentation to support each charge.
“I want to assure everyone that when the misappropriation was detected, OAH immediately took steps to protect the agency and the public from further loss,” said RaShelle Davis, the office’s chief administrative law judge, in a statement. “We implemented all the recommendations of the State Auditor and integrated ongoing oversight and monitoring to ensure those controls remain effective.”

This story by Randolph T. Holhut and Jeff Potter was first published in The Commons on Sept. 9, 2025.
BRATTLEBORO — The Windham County Heat Fund, with the help of a $20,000 matching grant, is kicking off a major fundraising campaign and a benefit concert to support people who have relied on federal fuel assistance that will no longer be available.
The Heat Fund — founded in 2005 by Brattleboro residents Richard Davis and Daryl Pillsbury — was intended to help county residents who fell between the cracks of this social safety net, and the two friends have prided themselves on keeping the organization small and nimble over the years.
In a typical year, Davis said, the heat fund raises about $50,000, and he and Pillsbury have handled its administration the old-fashioned way — by looking the people in need in the eye, talking with them and connecting them with fuel.
But with federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program on the chopping block, the Windham County Heat Fund — which has been a supplemental source of local aid sustained by two volunteers and their force of will — faces the pressure of becoming the primary source of relief for people who can’t afford heat this winter.
“My fear is that people are going to try and sign up for heat assistance, and they won’t get it,” Davis said. And if this happens, he said, “people are going to die.”
He said the match will be used toward the organization’s newest initiative: to launch a GoFundMe page with a goal of $100,000. Every dollar of the first $20,000 donated will be matched by the trust, doubling donors’ contributions. 
The heat fund will also hold a concert, “Save a Life,” to kick off the start of the fall fundraising effort on Sunday, Sept. 14, at 7 p.m. at the Heart Rose Club (the former Shriners Building), 11 Green St.
Performers will include Daniel Kasnitz, Jennie Reichman, Stan Davis, Duane Young and the trio of Patty Carpenter, Jeremy Gold and Verandah Porche.
A looming crisis
This year the need is greater because the Trump administration has cut off the ability for the federal government to provide fuel assistance, with LIHEAP caught in the cuts of the first months of Trump’s term.
Congress approved $25 million for the program, despite the administration’s cutting the funding entirely from the Trump budget.
Instead, the federal Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., fired all the employees in the Division of Energy Assistance, which administered the LIHEAP program.
“The money has been allocated (by Congress), but there’s no one to give it out, and no one in the administration seems to be concerned about that,” Davis told The Commons.
Last year, the state of Vermont received $20 million and, according to U.S. Sen. Peter Welch’s office, that funding will most likely not be available this year. Welch, along with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, have been pressing unsuccessfully for reinstating the employees.
The program is administered by the state through its Department of Children and Families, which work with regional community action organizations like Southeastern Vermont Community Action (SEVCA) in Westminster and with local fuel vendors. Davis has found no sense of urgency at the local or state level.
“Nobody seems to know that there’s a problem,” Davis said. “Normally, the money is released at the end of November. The local fuel companies like Cota & Cota and Dead River say many of their customers are on fuel assistance, and they don’t know what’s happening.”
Davis said he is grateful that the Thompson Trust is stepping up with the matching money for the crowdfunding drive.
The charitable foundation distributes income from the fortune of 19th-century philanthropist and art dealer Thomas Thompson, who established it to help “poor seamstresses, needle-women and shop girls” in Windham County and in Dutchess County, New York.
Courts have loosened those constraints, and the trust more generally funds causes in the two regions, with a special emphasis on health-related projects.
But Davis said that philanthropy can’t fully make up for the loss of federal funding.“There’s no way we can make up for this loss,” Davis said. “I really don’t know why more people aren’t worried about this.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)For the second time, a federal trial in the 2020 shooting death of Alvin Cole by then-Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensah ended in a hung jury on Thursday. Deliberations began shortly after 5 p.m. on Wednesday, going until around 8 p.m. Jurors returned Thursday morning, and deliberated for a total of nearly 10 hours, more than doubling the amount of time deliberations lasted during the first trial, before deciding that they were hopelessly deadlocked. Plaintiff attorneys asked the jury for a total of $9 million ($5 million in compensatory damages, and $4 million in punitive damages), a figure far lower than the $22 million they asked for last time. 
Following the trial, Mensah attorney Joseph Wirth said “it’s still proven a difficult case for the jury to reach a conclusion.” Wirth and his partner, attorney Jasmyne Baynard, declined to talk about settlement discussions with the media, but said they plan to talk to the jurors. “We have felt strongly about the merits of this case,” said Baynard. “I’ve felt strongly about my representation of Joseph Mensah and every other police officer that I represent. Feel strongly about his actions in this situation, and we’re going to go forward under that belief.”
Cole family attorneys Kimberly Motley and Nate Cade said that while they wanted a different outcome, “We are pleased that it was a hung jury.” Motley stressed that “it’s important for the public to be aware that Joseph Mensah killed three people in five years as a Wauwatosa police officer, that’s really important, and that this jury did not believe what he was saying. Now we have a jury that came back — and they were hung — but they deliberated longer, they had more evidence, and the evidence is just not good for him.” Motley said that Mensah’s story “doesn’t make sense.”
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
During deliberations, jurors asked for transcripts of interviews of officers on the scene of the Cole shooting conducted by the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), a request initially denied by Judge Adelman, due to questions about whether the interviews had been admitted as evidence. Later, Adelman reversed his decision and allowed the jury to see MAIT interviews of officers David Shamsi and Evan Olson. The two officers gave contradicting statements to MAIT investigators in 2020 about whether Cole moved or pointed his gun shortly before Mensah fired. Jurors also asked for Mensah’s deposition testimony, in which plaintiff attorneys say Mensah implied that when he fired on Cole, he was only concerned about his own safety. On the stand this week, Mensah said that he fired to protect himself and everyone else around Mayfair Mall. 
Throughout the trial, defense attorneys argued that the unrecorded officer interviews by MAIT were little more than hearsay, and attempted to limit the jury’s access to them. Besides arguing that MAIT reports are hearsay in the second trial, defense attorneys noted in the first trial that officers are not under oath when they talk to investigators after a police shooting. The debates in court raised questions about the policies and practices that MAIT relies on when investigating officer-involved deaths, which also inform whether prosecutors will charge officers with crimes after killing civilians. 
Baynard said that “I don’t think that we’re in a position to comment on MAIT’s investigation, and truly that was not really an issue in this case to be decided, so no, I don’t have any issues.” Baynard added that, “I have seen plenty of MAIT investigations, I have seen plenty of investigations done by the [state Division of Criminal Investigation], I think they did a fine investigation here. I think that sometimes people forget that officers in these situations are afforded the exact same rights as anybody else would be afforded, and beyond that I’m not really interested in commenting on MAIT’s protocol.”
Cade stressed that the MAIT statements “are not heresy, ’cause they’re the statements.” Calling the heresy argument “nonsense”, Cade said that the problem with MAIT “is that they allow the officers to make decisions about it being recorded.” While Cade accepts that Mensah himself may have Fifth Amendment rights in such a case he said “the other officers don’t”. By contrast, civilian witnesses are recorded far more often than officers after police shootings. “Why do they bend over backwards for officers who are not even directly involved in terms of shooting,” asked Cade. “That’s a handicap. They said that MAIT was supposed to be designed to give the public confidence. How can you have confidence if you’re not going to tape officer’s conversations, so we know exactly what they said?”
Wirth said that Mensah “is absolutely disappointed that we weren’t able to obtain a verdict today,” adding that Mensah is no longer in law enforcement, “and it weighs heavily on him.” Wirth said “it’s a very important case to the Cole family, it’s a very important case to Joseph Mensah.” 
The last day of testimony
On Wednesday defense attorneys called Joshua Boye, a video editor and graphic designer who reviewed squad car video from the Cole shooting. Boye testified that he had been paid by defense attorneys to edit the video as they directed by modifying audio, adjusting color and contrast, and adding a “spotlight” around Cole as he ran.
During cross examination, plaintiff attorneys drew attention to a timestamp in Boye’s video which does not appear in the raw version, leading plaintiff attorneys to question whether Boye had been given an altered version by defense attorneys. Later on, when this issue was raised again, Judge Adelman said that he hadn’t seen anything to suggest that the video had been tampered with. Boye repeatedly said that any edits he made to the video were done “at the direction of attorneys.”
Wauwatosa officer Evan Olson, who was one of the officers who responded to Mayfair Mall the night that Cole was killed, testified as uniformed Wauwatosa officers flowed into the courtroom to sit around Mensah’s wife, as they had during each day of the trial. A Wauwatosa PD spokesperson said in a statement to Wisconsin Examiner that “some officers chose to attend the trial in uniform to show their support for a former colleague, which is not uncommon in high-profile cases. Their attendance was voluntary and did not impact patrol staffing or the department’s ability to respond to calls of service.”

Cole’s family, as well as the parents of Jay Anderson Jr., Mensah’s second fatal shooting in 2016, also attended every day of the trial. Motley and Cade took issue with the presence of uniformed Wauwatosa officers. “This isn’t the city of Wauwatosa,” said Motley, “so I was kind of concerned about what was happening in the city of Wauwatosa with all these police officers that came in uniform to sit in court for hours and hours, for a person who no longer works for Wauwatosa as a police officer, and is no longer a Wauwatosa officer period. So I think that the taxpayers should demand why that happened.”
Cade called the uniformed officers’ presence intimidating for the jury. “We aren’t allowed to say anything about the thin blue line and backing the blue, but it was obvious,” he said. During the first trial plaintiff attorneys were told that the Cole family was not allowed to wear any clothing with messages about Alvin. 
Olson testified that he arrived at Mayfair Mall responding to a report about disorderly conduct  involving a gun. After arriving, Olson immediately encountered at least two teens who were part of Cole’s group, and ordered them to the ground. Off in the distance, he could see Cole running from officers and mall security, before hearing a single shot. Olson testified to seeing Cole “in what I would say is a low ready position,” similar to a stance taken in football. He said that Cole pointed a firearm at him, making him move out of the way of what he thought would be more gunfire, and prepare to shoot himself. Olson called Cole a “lethal threat”, and said that after Mensah fired, Cole went from the football-like position to lying prone on the ground. Plaintiff attorneys argued that Olson was seeing Cole in the act of falling. Olson kicked the gun from Cole’s hand and assisted in CPR. 
Olson, Mensah and Shamsi gave contradicting statements, opening  the door for the trial. Both Olson and Mensah said that the gun was pointed in their directions, but they were positioned on opposite sides of the parking lot. Shamsi, who was the closest officer to Cole, testified that Cole and the gun didn’t  move after Cole fell. Olson said he didn’t think other officers who didn’t see the gun move were lying. Every officer testified that foot pursuits are dangerous, unpredictable situations especially when guns are involved. 
When Olson left the stand, he took a seat in the gallery near Mensah’s wife and the other Wauwatosa officers. Olson, like the rest of the officers, was uniformed every day of the trial. On Thursday, when the jury continued deliberations, Olson and a Wauwatosa police sergeant came to court in civilian clothes.
Sarah Hopkins, a civilian witness, claimed to have been outside the Cheesecake Factory restaurant when she saw Cole being chased by mall security. Hopkins said that Cole stopped running at one point, making her think that he was surrendering, but then that he turned and pointed a gun at the officers. Hopkins said that Cole “was like fumbling around” and that “all of a sudden we hear rapid shots.” Plaintiff attorneys questioned the fact that Hopkins described Cole doing a motion which no one else described seeing. Davion Beard, a former Mayfair Mall security guard, initially helped to locate the group of teens, and participated in the foot chase. Beard, who ran track, testified to essentially being the closest person to Cole with just a foot or two separating them. When the first shot was fired, Beard said he dropped to the ground, with Shamsi not far behind him, and that he didn’t see Cole crawl, turn his body, or point a gun.

Testimony concluded with Mensah’s attorneys calling Michael Knetzger, a certified instructor in Defense and Arrest Tactics (DAAT) and former Green Bay police officer. Knetzger repeatedly implied that the jurors should put themselves in Mensah’s mindset at the moment of the shooting. When cross examined, plaintiff attorneys drew attention to Knetzger’s lack of “real world experience” dealing with shootings and homicides, and that his doctorate and degrees had come from online universities including one that marketed itself as the nation’s “most affordable online Christian University.”
During closing arguments Cade reminded the jury that Cole was a kid who made stupid decisions like many young people, including his own sons who Cade called “knuckleheads.” Cade stressed that “for Joseph Mensah to be right, everybody else has to be wrong,” referring to the testimony from multiple officers, Beard, and other witnesses that Cole had not turned toward Mensah or moved after he fell to the ground. Cade said that Olson testified to support his friend Mensah, and that Mensah himself had  incentive to change his story.
Attorney Baynard, representing the defense, said that Cole made “catastrophically dangerous” decisions which went beyond the sort of mistakes people make when they’re young. Baynard said that “police are not required to gamble with their lives”, and that while Cole’s death was tragic, “we are in court today because of his actions.” Baynard said that “Cole was in control of the situation” and that “he was driving the bus”, saying in her closing argument that “I’m not sure how many more opportunities he should have been given to comply.” Baynard described the turning motion Cole allegedly made as “a quick shift,” and made claims about prior witness testimony which Cade later refuted.
The Cole family said they are undeterred by Thursday’s hung jury. “We’re a strong united family,” said Tracy Cole, Alvin’s mother. Despite the hung jury, Cole said that she is encouraged because “somebody sees that my son was killed for no reason,” and that she believed her son was killed as he attempted to surrender. 
“We are going to fight you Joseph, we ain’t gave up Joseph,” she added. “And my lawyers ain’t gave up.” 
Motley echoed the sentiment. “It’s a good result,” she said of the hung jury, “and we’re going to keep fighting…because this is an important case.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Assembly Republicans passed a handful of bills Thursday on an array of issues. Democrats argued the measures won’t solve the problems facing Wisconsinites and unveiled their own proposals. 
The Assembly floor session is the first since lawmakers broke for the summer after completing the state budget. The Senate does not plan to meet this month, and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) told reporters during a press conference that it was a “shame” they wouldn’t. She said she has had conversations about meeting in October. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said Republicans’ agenda for Thursday was an example of “prioritizing culture wars” rather than “doing what’s right.” 
Democrats’ education bills
Senate and Assembly Democratic lawmakers proposed their own package of education bills ahead of the floor session that would increase general aid for public schools by $325 per pupil, provide transparency on voucher school costs and provide free school meals to students. 
“We would like to see our legislative Republican colleagues focus on the issues that are facing Wisconsinites — issues like cost of living, their public schools and their property taxes,” Neubauer said. “That’s why we’re bringing forward this package today, because we know from conversations with our constituents what they’re really concerned about.”
The Democrats’ education agenda  contrasts with the plan announced by Assembly Republicans earlier this week. Republican proposals include encouraging consolidation of schools, calling on Gov. Tony Evers to opt into a federal school choice program, banning drones over schools and improving math education.
One Democratic  bill would dedicate $325 in additional per pupil state aid to Wisconsin school districts. It would cost nearly $500 million for 2025-26 and nearly $700 million for 2026-27. 
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) called it the “bare minimum” that school districts need and said it would help school districts avoid raising property taxes. 
“School districts will do better under this bill than current law,” Roys said. “We know every kid around the state deserves to go to a great school so that they can meet their potential, but to be clear, this bill is not everything that our kids need or deserve, not even close.” 
Wisconsin’s most recent state budget did not give school districts any increase in per pupil general aid, despite calls from education advocates, Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats to provide additional funding.
Republican lawmakers said they would not increase state aid after  Evers used his partial veto power to extend a cap on the annual increase to limits on the revenue districts can raise from local taxpayer of $325 per pupil for the next 400 years. Without state funding, school districts only have the option of increasing property taxes to bring in the additional funds. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau projects that property taxes will increase by more than 7% on average over the next year.
Roys said the bill is a “test” to see if Republicans want to help keep property taxes stable, since providing no state aid to schools will drive those taxes up. She blamed Republicans for placing districts in a situation where they have to go to property taxpayers to keep up with costs. 
Roys also knocked a Republican bill that would encourage school districts to explore consolidation and sharing services. 
“They want to consolidate school districts. They want to close schools, and by the way, everything’s the governor’s fault. Give me a break,” Roys said. “They want to hold the line on property taxes? Prove it.” 
The bill also includes an additional $31 million to ensure no school districts receive less state aid in 2025-26 than they received in 2024-25. 
The Department of Public Instruction’s July 1 estimate found that 277 districts — or 65.8% — of school districts were going to receive less in general aid from the state in 2025. 
Another bill seeks to provide greater transparency on the costs of voucher schools to districts by requiring property tax bills to include information about the cost. The bill would expand on a push that public school advocates are making at a local level after the city of Green Bay was able to add the information. 
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said the bill would help inform residents who may be confused about where their tax dollars are going. 
“We can say, time and time again, that the state is underfunding our local public schools. That is true. What they also don’t understand, and there’s a really simple fix, is how much of that money is leaving their district to go to other voucher schools. In some cases, millions and tens of millions of dollars… It is a simple fix. It is very straightforward,” Andraca said.
Requiring in-person work for state employees 
AB 39 would require state employees to return to in-person work for at least 80% of their time — or four days a week for a full-time employee — starting this year. The bill passed 51-44 with all Democrats opposing it. 
The bill initially required state agency employees to be in person the whole week, but an amendment dropped the minimum to four days. 
Republican lawmakers have been calling for stricter limits on remote work for several years. The policies became normal for state employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Nedweski said she isn’t “anti-telework,” but said remote work needs to be managed and measured. She said agencies haven’t provided data to show it is working. During the Assembly Committee on Government Oversight, Accountability and Transparency hearing on the bill, agency leaders said remote work policies have helped with recruitment and retention of employees.
“It’s time for state employees to return to the office and do the work that Wisconsin’s hard-working taxpayers are paying them to do to the best of their ability and in their most productive and efficient way,” Nedweski said. “We have a policy that allows for remote work agreements. We’re not saying the policy is ending, we’re saying, come back, have your performance evaluated and re-sign your remote work agreement.” 
Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona), the ranking member of the GOAT committee, pointed to the testimony they heard as he argued the bill wouldn’t help.
“A bill like this with a one-size-fits-all return to work policy will not make our state government better… Remote work policies were born from a crisis, and we all remember too well. They’ve  become a success for our state government. We now have state workers dispersed all across the state. We’ve achieved savings by consolidating physical workspace. We’ve stayed competitive with the private market by appealing to how employees want to work and then what they expect from their work environment.” 
Flag prohibition
AB 58 would prohibit flags, other than the United States flag, the state of Wisconsin flag and a few others on a list of exceptions, from being flown outside state and local buildings including the Wisconsin State Capitol. The bill passed 50-44, along party lines. 
Rep. Jerry O’Connor, the author of the bill, argued that flags are part of the reason for increasing divisiveness, and even political violence. Wisconsin leaders condemned political violence during the session after the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on Wednesday.
“It’s not the role of the government to pick the winners and losers on partisan and activist issues,” O’Connor said. 
Some of the exceptions would include local government flags, those commemorating veterans, prisoners of war or missing in action, those recognizing a foreign nation for special purposes and a flag of a unit of firefighters, law enforcement officers or emergency medical technicians. 
He said these exceptions are “simply recognizing those flags that are efficiently recognized by all levels of government.”
“We should have a shared outlook as to what we do as elected officials in this building here to promote unity and not division… I think we all could agree that those are the flags that represent all of us,” O’Connor said. 
Rep. Chuck Wichgers (R-Muskego) spoke specifically about pride flags, which are a symbol of the LGBTQ+ community, when explaining his support of the legislation. 
“You’re asking every Wisconsinite to sanction what that means,” Wichgers said in reference to the Progress Pride flag. The chevron portions of the flag include black and brown stripes to represent people of color who identify with the LGBTQ+ community as well as those living with HIV/AIDS. The light blue, pink and white stripes in the chevron represent transgender people.
“I can guarantee you when you ask the people that are in favor, they’re not going to know what that chevron means, so we’re endorsing, sanctioning something that is being flown above our flag that is probably divisive,” Wichgers said. 
Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) said, however, that she views the bill as being divisive and as a violation of the First Amendment. 
“I think as a body we should be promoting inclusiveness. It’s not just the more morally right thing to do. It also strengthens our communities, promotes mutual respect, and actually leads to more civic engagement,” Sinicki said. “These symbolic acts do matter. They matter to me, and they matter to the majority of people across Wisconsin.” 
Prohibit health services funding for immigrants without legal status
AB 308, coauthored by Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan), passed 50-44 along party lines. The bill would prohibit state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the United States.
Dallman said at a press conference that the bill is meant to stop Wisconsin from expanding its Medicaid to cover immigrants without legal status. Wisconsin already doesn’t allow this. 
“This is going to take a step forward to say that we are going to again keep these funds available for our citizens who are paying in all these dollars,” Dallman said. 
Advocates expressed concerns to the Examiner earlier this week that the bill would lead to health service providers having to check everyone’s citizenship status before providing care.
Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) said the bill is “the kind of thing that makes people hate politics.”
“We don’t provide health care to undocumented immigrants. The reason we’re voting on this today is so that the majority party can go out and tell their voters that Democrats failed to stop giving health insurance to undocumented people, but we can’t stop something that isn’t happening. Why waste time and taxpayer money this way?” Stroud said. “If you don’t have affordable health care, they don’t want you to hold them accountable. Instead, they want you to blame someone else.”

(Photo courtesy the Indiana State Library)The state’s ethics watchdogs met behind closed doors Thursday as questions mounted around former Indiana Secretary of Public Safety Jennifer-Ruth Green, whose recent resignation followed a remediation agreement connected to an inspector general investigation into potential ethics violations.
The Indiana State Ethics Commission met for less than 20 minutes in an executive session Thursday morning in Indianapolis. 
Although Green’s case was not listed on the public agenda, commissioners were scheduled to privately consider a probable cause affidavit and “an individual’s alleged misconduct.” 
It’s not clear what they discussed specifically or if any decisions were made. Commissioners declined to comment following the session.
Remediation document reveals ethics concerns before Indiana cabinet secretary resignation

The meeting came just days after reporting revealed that Green signed a remediation agreement with state officials earlier this year. That document outlined a series of allegations against Green, including claims that she used state vehicles and travel cards for personal and political purposes, and that she directed state employees to assist with those activities during work hours.
Additional accusations center around inappropriate workplace conduct, ranging from “conversations with employees about personal relationships, intimate subjects, or sexual activities,” to “uninvited touching of employees” and retaliation.
Green denied most of the allegations, although state officials said she admitted to “limited” personal use of state vehicles and “having a financial relationship with an employee” without disclosing the conflict of interest.
The document, obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, shows Gov. Mike Braun’s office allowed Green to remain in her secretary position “pending the results of the Office of Inspector General investigation with appropriate safeguards in place to prevent additional ethics violations, including additional ethics training.”
The governor’s office confirmed Indiana’s inspector general made a confidential referral of personnel related findings that were outside the scope of their jurisdiction on Sept. 4. The governor reviewed that report the morning of Sept. 5, and instructed his staff to discuss the findings with Green immediately. During that meeting, Green resigned.
How the process works
Complaints about possible ethics violations are first submitted to Indiana’s Office of Inspector General. Anyone can make a request through a confidential hotline, online form or in writing. After an initial review, the office decides whether the matter falls within its jurisdiction and merits a formal investigation.
If a probe is launched, investigators may interview witnesses, review documents and issue subpoenas, according to state statute. The OIG compiles records that remain confidential unless they are later filed with the state ethics commission.
When investigators believe they have “specific and credible evidence” of wrongdoing, they can seek a probable cause finding from the commission.
At that point, the OIG prepares a probable cause affidavit, which serves as a confidential summary of the evidence. Commissioners review that affidavit behind closed doors to determine whether probable cause exists.

OIG Spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland emphasized that decisions made in executive meetings are “administrative in nature — to determine if a matter will advance to a public proceeding.” If the commission chooses to move forward, the case will appear on a public agenda with the respondent’s name attached.
Per state law, complaints filed with the ethics commission remain confidential until commissioners make a probable cause finding. If probable cause is confirmed, the inspector general files a formal complaint that becomes open to public inspection, though certain details can still be redacted. 
McFarland said a formal complaint only becomes a public record once it is officially filed — a process that can take up to 30 days, including time for notifying the respondent.
The commission must then set a public hearing, where witnesses and evidence are presented.
If the commission ultimately finds an ethics violation, it can impose sanctions that include fines and other penalties. Some cases, however, are resolved administratively by the inspector general without ever reaching the commission, often through a settlement agreement.
When evidence suggests a criminal offense may have occurred, state law further requires the OIG to certify that evidence to the appropriate prosecutor. Ethics commission proceedings only deal with administrative law, not criminal law. 
That means the prosecutor — not the inspector general or the ethics commission — decides whether to bring criminal charges.
What is public — and what is not
Most of the OIG’s investigation process takes place outside public view. Intake records and investigative files are confidential. The probable cause affidavit itself is also not disclosable, McFarland said.
The pivot to public disclosure comes only if the commission finds probable cause. At that stage, the complaint and related hearing documents become available for public inspection, with some redactions allowed.

If a prosecutor later pursues criminal charges, those filings appear in the public criminal docket.
In 2018, for example, a separate, high-profile state ethics investigation centered around former Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill — who was accused by four women of unwanted touching at a late-night bar gathering.
The investigation was prompted by requests from the four leaders of the Indiana General Assembly. The probe included dozens of witness interviews, as well as multiple subpoenas for surveillance video and other evidence, according to an investigative report later released by the OIG. Hill also provided a video-recorded statement.
Although the inspector general’s report was critical of Hill’s behavior that night, he was determined not to have violated ethics laws. A special prosecutor assigned to the case additionally declined to press criminal charges.
But in other proceedings before the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission, a hearing officer found that Hill committed misdemeanor battery and violated ethics rules related to public esteem for the legal profession. 
The Indiana Supreme Court later suspended Hill’s law license for 30 days.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)As students return to school across the state, one thing is clear: Oklahoma’s leaders are not committed to improving education for our students. 
In addition to continuously failing to adequately invest in our public schools, Oklahoma leaders have long undermined students’ education through a variety of policies, such as promoting election lies, marginalizing trans youth, and disinvesting from public schools that serve 90% of Oklahoma students. 
While these sorts of attacks are not new, this year leaders seem particularly eager to target Oklahoma students with an immigrant background by passing or attempting to pass policies that directly harm these students.
For instance, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education have revoked a policy that allowed some immigrant students lacking legal status to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities. The regents made this change after a federal judge affirmed Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s joint request with Trump’s U.S. Department of Justice to end the practice, which had been Oklahoma law for almost 20 years. 
That law allowed some immigrant students to pay in-state tuition rates if they had lived in the state for at least two years before graduating from an Oklahoma high school. To qualify, students also had to submit a notarized affidavit attesting that they were seeking, or would seek, lawful immigration status. 
Attending college is already expensive enough for Oklahoma families, with annual in-state tuition and fees at OSU and OU costing $13,920 and $15,135, respectively. Charging out-of-state tuition prices would more than double those costs, raising the price to $29,440 and $33,255. In a time when we are facing labor shortages for professionals like doctors and nurses, it does not make sense to effectively bar hundreds of Oklahoma high schoolers from attending college in the state they call home solely because of their immigration status. 
This policy will do nothing to address the broken immigration system in the United States. All it will do is punish Oklahoma students who already live in and contribute to our communities, want to pursue higher education, and who intend to continue giving back to our state — yet currently have no way to adjust their immigration status. 
Of the 44,000-plus students who graduate from Oklahoma high schools each year, immigrant students who qualified for the in-state tuition rate make up fewer than 1,000. Out of these, about 400 are currently in college and would be affected by the ruling. 
Our attorney general is publicly targeting a tiny fraction of future college-bound high school students and current college students for his own political gain. 
State leaders have also targeted young students. 
Earlier this year, state Superintendent Ryan Walters proposed an administrative rule to collect the immigration status of children who enroll in public schools. Although the rule was ultimately rejected by the Legislature, it created a lingering fear in immigrant communities that schools would become part of the immigration enforcement apparatus. 
These fears, compounded by heightened immigration enforcement and toxic rhetoric towards immigrants from state and federal leaders, will have devastating impacts on families and students’ education. 
Years of research have shown that heightened immigration enforcement increases absenteeism and negatively impacts students’ academic performance, consequences that will impact students far beyond the classroom, as education is closely correlated to future earnings and health outcomes. Unfortunately, many of these concerns have already materialized, with schools nationwide already reporting higher absenteeism rates following immigration raids, as parents decide to keep their kids at home rather than risk separation.
As the new school year begins in Oklahoma, the federal effort to target communities with immigrants will have real impacts, potentially lowering students’ attendance rates and academic performance significantly. But Oklahoma’s families also face attacks from our very own state leaders, who are choosing to pander to federal leaders rather than protecting students.
Instead of playing politics with the lives of our families and children, Oklahoma leaders should focus on strengthening education — passing policies that support schools, boost attendance, and encourage students to seek higher education. 
Oklahoma’s future depends on whether we choose fear and division or invest in every student’s right to learn, thrive, and contribute to our state.

The Black Butte mine now has access to an additional 9.2 million tons of federal coal — enough to keep the mine in production through 2039.
The post Feds fast-track coal mining expansion in southwest Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration this week expedited approval of a southwest Wyoming coal mine’s expansion.
The Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement completed its environmental review for the Black Butte coal mine plan in under 30 days, according to the Interior Department. Typically, a federal environmental review, which includes volumes of documents regarding environmental, socioeconomic and health impacts — along with public input — takes at least a couple of years.
The updated plan essentially allows for continued production at the mine that has been scooping coal west of Rock Springs since the late 1970s. It gives the mine access to an additional 9.2 million tons of federal coal — enough to maintain mining through 2039, according to federal documents.
“This is great news for southwest Wyoming and for Wyoming energy consumers,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a prepared statement.
Gordon blamed the Biden administration for delaying the mine’s expansion, claiming the Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement continually added “paper obstacles” to the review process. 
“If this way of doing things becomes normalized, then you can basically justify doing anything on public lands.”Emma Jones, Sierra Club, Wyoming chapter
“After the Biden Administration ignored my earlier requests to move forward with this approval, it is most gratifying that [Interior] Secretary [Doug] Burgum took action and expedited the review of the Environmental Impact Statement on the Black Butte Mine Expansion,” Gordon said. “Once more the Trump administration is demonstrating its commitment to a wise, multiple-use approach to public lands and minerals in Wyoming.”
Interior officials noted that the push to approve the Black Butte mine expansion was under the direction of President Donald Trump’s Unleashing American Energy and Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry executive orders — the same push to advance a 440 million ton coal lease and a 14.5 million ton expansion at the Antelope mine in northeast Wyoming.
Some conservation groups say the administration is moving too quickly to fully analyze environmental and human health impacts, or to allow for thorough public input on such federal coal actions.

“The government is not doing their due diligence to actually examine the impact this might have on public lands,” Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Climate and Energy Organizer Emma Jones told WyoFile. “They don’t know what the impact is, really. If this way of doing things becomes normalized, then you can basically justify doing anything on public lands.” 
The Trump administration has retooled implementation of federal leasing and permitting actions under the National Environmental Policy Act, speeding up the process as part of Trump’s declaration of a National Energy Emergency. Though energy — particularly electricity — demand in the U.S. is skyrocketing, it’s unclear whether such federal actions will help pull the U.S. coal industry out of its severe 10-year decline, conservation groups, including the Sierra Club, say.
“It’s unclear who is going to buy this coal,” Jones said, regarding the Black Butte mine. 
The nearby Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant has served as the Black Butte mine’s primary customer for decades. Sierra Club and others have speculated whether the power plant’s owner, utility giant PacifiCorp, will continue to rely on the mine as it has in the past. The company recently converted two of four coal-burning units at Jim Bridger to natural gas. Black Butte employs about 56 miners, according to federal data. The workforce there suffered two layoffs in recent years, most recently in the summer of 2024.

Health department kicks off statewide meetings to gather information on how $500-800 million in Rural Health Transformation Program funds can help the state over next five years.
The post Amid health care access worries, Wyoming could receive millions in short-term federal dollars appeared first on WyoFile .","Though critics have decried President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act as a means to strip Medicaid and insurance coverage from tens of thousands of Wyoming residents, supporters point to a bill provision aimed at boosting rural health care. 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is designed to funnel $50 billion to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Wyoming, one of America’s most rural states, stands to receive $500 million to $800 million from the program over the next five years, according to the health department.
Before it applies for the money, however, the state wants to pin down Wyoming’s highest-priority needs. The Wyoming Department of Health will kick off a string of public meetings on Friday aimed at gathering input on rural health care challenges and opportunities. 
Meetings begin Friday in Newcastle and wrap up Oct. 2 in Laramie. A virtual gathering is scheduled for Sept. 23. 
“Local voices will guide us in identifying where investments make the most difference and how the state can play a constructive role in making the most of this unique opportunity,” Stefan Johansson, director of the Wyoming Department of Health, said in a release. 
Those fighting for better health care access in Wyoming aren’t totally sold, however. The federal funds could certainly be helpful, Healthy Wyoming Executive Director Jenn Lowe said, but with a five-year time limit, they won’t likely do enough to make up for the recent and expected losses incurred in a state that already struggles with a dearth of resources. 
“It sounds significant, but it really is just a drop in the bucket,” against the background of aggregate needs, Lowe said. 
Still, she added, “people who care about health care access in Wyoming should absolutely go to these meetings” to help shape how those funds can be spent. 
Eroding landscape
With its rural characteristics, Wyoming has long struggled to provide affordable and accessible health care. Hospitals struggle to hire and retain doctors and nurses, service lines like baby deliveries have eroded and patients travel hundreds of miles for treatment. 
Several recent factors converging on both the state and federal levels further threaten access to care in Wyoming.
“Costs will go up for just about anybody who purchases insurance in the state, and access to care is likely to go down,” Lowe told an audience at a recent health care forum in Lander.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. That will result in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Changes include increased work requirements and potential penalties for states that have expanded Medicaid. 
As one of the few states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid, Wyoming will avoid some of the immediate hits, experts say. But it will still likely result in coverage losses as well as other downstream effects. The cuts in the federal bill could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, a new economic analysis finds. 
The Wyoming Medicaid program covers 62,000 patients, according to Families USA. Some 46,000 residents, meanwhile, get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer.
That second patient pool is also anticipated to see major changes. Enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the bill does not renew them. That will result in significant premium spikes for some patients. 
According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The organization anticipates that the tax credit sunset puts somewhere between 11,000 to 20,000 Wyoming residents at risk of losing their coverage.
“These tax credits have been a lifeline for folks in Wyoming to afford health care insurance,” Lowe said.

A shrinking pool of insurance providers is only expected to further exacerbate the issue. Mountain Health Co-op announced in August that it will no longer offer health plans in Wyoming at the end of the year. 
In addition, the nonprofit Enroll Wyoming, which offers free help to those seeking health coverage, saw a roughly 90% cut in funding in August. The organization has transitioned from a 10-person staff to 1.5 full-time employees. While much smaller, Enroll Wyoming still endeavors to assist residents, a press release stated. 
A major investment 
Republicans pushed back on criticism of their bill’s health care impacts, pointing to programs contained in it that they say will boost rural care. 
In remarks lauding the bill’s passage, Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a physician, said it strengthens health care, “especially in rural communities.” He pointed to a renewed push for innovative care, hospital support and Medicaid work requirements as benefits.
“I practiced medicine in Casper, Wyoming, for over 20 years,” Barrasso said. “The changes in this law will strengthen Medicaid for the people who truly need it.”
One of the bill’s offshoots is the Rural Health Transformation Program, which will supply $50 billion to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Half of that money will be divided among states that submit applications. The idea is to let states determine the best use of funds.  
According to the Wyoming Department of Health, program funding is intended to support priorities that include chronic disease prevention, behavioral health, access to care in rural communities, workforce development and technological advances. 
In addition to the eight in-person meetings around the state, the department will collect input by sending out a survey later this fall to refine the priorities. 
A healthy dose of skepticism
The program promises a significant infusion of funds into Wyoming’s health care network, and supporters say it does so with a common-sense approach. 
“The [program] is designed to help all rural hospitals, not just those in states that have been gaming the system,” reads a Senate Finance Committee fact sheet. “But for the states that need help re-focusing their Medicaid programs, the RHTP can serve as a bridge to shore up rural hospitals and prevent gaps in care.”
Lowe, however, doesn’t see it as a panacea. Programs spawned from it will likely require funding beyond the five-year window, she said. And that’s not her only concern.

“I think that it’s fair to say that whenever large chunks of money like this are pumped into grant-funded programs,” Lowe said, “some of those programs prove to be successful and some might even be revolutionary in how they treat rural health care. However, there will also be boondoggles, and there will be bridges to nowhere where funding is spent and nothing ever happens.”
That’s why it’s crucial that people partake in the process now, she said.  
“I think it’s imperative that people pay attention to what’s going on in Wyoming to ensure that … this money is not wasted, that it’s spent in a way that leaves a long and effective program in its place.”

So busy, according to park officials, that on peak days more than 1,000 people flock to the site, and annual visitations tally more than 160,000. 
“Use at Taggart Lake has increased more than 100% in the last 10 years,” Superintendent Chip Jenkins said. That compares to a 20% growth in overall park visitation, showing just how appealing it is. 
Facilities are no longer adequate to serve the 700 or so average daily visitors, and park officials have sketched out a plan to expand the parking lot, reconfigure trails, install new toilets and improve other aspects of the trailhead area to accommodate mushrooming use.

During a Wednesday presentation on the environmental assessment, Jenkins said the so-called preferred alternative would create a more accessible and capacious site that would help protect the resources. Park data documented numerous instances of fecal matter and toilet paper near Taggart Lake in 2022, according to the assessment. 
“We think that this preferred alternative will help us make for a better Taggart experience and for a better Grand Teton experience,” Jenkins said.

The project is estimated to cost $14.6 million to construct, with the Grand Teton National Park Foundation providing more than $10 million of that. Much of the remaining expense will be funded through appropriated federal dollars, primarily through the National Park Service Centennial Challenge, Jenkins said. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2026. 
The project underscores how Grand Teton and neighboring Yellowstone are wrestling with growing visitors who are filling parking lots, crowding trails and putting a strain on park services like bathrooms and search and rescue. 
A park hotspot 
As a launching-off point for popular hikes near the park’s southern entrance, the trailhead is one of the most common places for people to start their visit to Grand Teton, Jenkins said. It’s also a well-used parking spot for skiers setting out on winter adventures.
Site maintenance has not kept pace with usage growth. Park officials have been gathering public comment on the Taggart Lake experience for the last year to guide improvements to the site. Proposals are mapped out in the environmental assessment. Under the preferred alternative, the project would:

Expand the parking lot.
Install new permanent toilets and a water station. 
Redesign the trailhead area and create more accessible pathways. 
Make improvements to the Taggart Lake shoreline to better define access points. 
Improve facilities at the nearby Cottonwood Creek Picnic area. 

Objectives of the plan include better safety for bicyclists and better protection for nearby wildlife, according to the assessment. 
The environmental assessment also contains a “no action” alternative, under which Grand Teton would continue to maintain the project area as is.

If the preferred action option takes place, the Taggart Lake trailhead upgrades would be among several construction projects scheduled for the park through 2028. 
Zooming out
The busy Taggart Lake trailhead underscores the broader challenges growing visitation presents to national park managers. 
Grand Teton and Yellowstone both reported record visitation in 2021. Visitations dipped since then, but the overall trend is still climbing. 
Right now, Grand Teton is on track to tally its second-highest year for visitation, Jenkins said. Yellowstone, meanwhile, has tallied 3.5 million recreation visits through August, up slightly from 2024 but still behind pace to top 2021. 
“Our infrastructure is not always adequate for current visitation numbers, let alone for increasing future levels,” Jenkins said during a congressional field hearing held in the park last week.

Though both parks have implemented measures like camping reservations, vehicle limits at crowded lots and a pilot shuttle system, they have yet to adopt more drastic tools like timed-entry systems that Arches and Rocky Mountain National Parks have adopted to manage huge crowds. 
Public lands advocates are keeping a close eye on national parks this year in the wake of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency efforts. Since the Trump administration took office, the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff, according to the National Parks Conservation Association. 
It appears Wyoming’s parks avoided the brunt of those cuts. Yellowstone National Park’s 2025 staffing is higher than last year, a park spokeswoman told WyoFile.

Greg Gianforte speaks to the property tax task force on what he wants to see in a report later this year. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Sometimes you really have to ask yourself: “Just how dumb do Montana’s politicians think we are?”  
The latest example comes as Governor Gianforte announces he’s appointing an energy task force to “unleash American made energy in our state.”  Yet, while claiming an “all of the above” approach, only a very naive person would believe this is about anything except “unleashing” more climate-killing coal and fossil fuels. 
It’s well documented in the policy arena that there are any number of reasons politicians appoint task forces.  

A task force provides handy cover for those so-called “leaders” who lack the courage to simply state their goals and have an open public debate about the pros and cons — and take the “slings and arrows” that arise.
 It provides the illusion of considering all the options and whittling those down to what provides “the greatest good for the greatest number.”
Those special interests likely to benefit from the task force recommendations can deny they exerted raw political power to benefit themselves.  In the meantime, the token appointees from, say, the “green” community actually think they might be taken seriously. 
And finally, there’s no guarantee whatsoever that all of the task force recommendations will be adopted and implemented — well, unless they forward the pre-determined goal of the politician who appoints it.  

Gianforte’s energy task force covers all the bases.  
He’ll have “recommendations” to follow, not decisions for which he is personally responsible.  
It provides the illusion of considering all options, which ignores the fact that the governor and entire Congressional delegation have already lined up behind unconditionally expanding Montana’s coal mining and burning, “drill, baby, drill,” and “American energy dominance.”  
All of this is predicated upon the equally facetious claim by Trump that the nation has a “national energy emergency” which, like the rest of his phony “emergencies,” is ginned up to circumvent long-held and prudent “look before you leap” procedures, including public opportunity for review and comment and analyzing environmental impacts. 
It provides NorthWestern Energy — which has run roughshod over Montana’s utility sector while ripping Montanans off with ever-more-expensive power — the ability to claim the “consensus” of the task force, rather than the actual fact that it has kept the gov in its back pocket all along.
And finally, any token recommendation to use renewable resources like solar and wind will fall by the wayside since Trump has already slashed funding and implementation of most solar and wind projects – including those already funded by Congress such as the “Solar for All” program.
Let’s not beat around the bush.  NorthWestern Energy is merging with Black Hills Corp. with the clear intent of developing and exporting Montana’s energy resources to at least an eight-state area.  
When it comes to environmental impacts, Gianforte’s director of the Department of Environmental Quality, who will chair the task force, has already given away the game.  Claiming Montana has “a long history of responsible energy development” ignores the fact that Colstrip has a Superfund-size pollution footprint on land and groundwater.  Yet, the task force will “identify barriers” to development rather than consider mitigating impacts. 
Montanans have watched endless task forces come and go while the politicians do what they planned on doing — or not doing — all along.  And don’t worry, no one will ask why we need massive data centers to serve a mere million Montanans scattered across the nation’s fourth largest state.  After all, we have to “meet the demand” like always.  
You’ll have your energy task force, governor, but Montanans won’t be fooled — we’re not as dumb as you think we are.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_5780-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

A story shared on social media, while unverifiable, holds an important kernel of wisdom about mending divides, columnist David Romtvedt writes. 
The post On the need to open ourselves to others appeared first on WyoFile .","The news: Where do we get it? How do we know what to trust? How do we see through material that has been distorted or is simply untrue and meant only to manipulate us as readers and as citizens in a troubled democracy?

Opinion

The other day, I received a Facebook post sent by a friend who received it from a friend. This post was written by a person who said he’d been told the story by a person who was an acquaintance of a friend of his — that is, the storyteller heard it from a person who had a friend who heard the story from an acquaintance of that friend.
Here’s the story: Two people are in line at the check-out counter of a pharmacy. One is an older man — maybe late 70s. The other person is a woman whose age is unknown, but we will soon learn that she is married and has a daughter. The older man is wearing a MAGA hat. The woman is wearing a T-shirt that says “Liberal AF.” We’re told the pharmacy is in a deeply blue city in an even more deeply red state — Iowa.
The man says to the woman, “You liberals are a cancer on our society.”
The pharmacy clerk is speechless. No one moves. Even time seems to stop.
The woman thinks to keep her mouth shut, but something wells up in her — our political situation and the threats against democracy both in our country and worldwide, her personal life, how some days we feel we can take no more. At the end of our rope, we speak.
She says, “My daughter has cancer, and you can call me what you want — a liberal, a fascist, whatever, but I know what cancer is. I know what it’s done to my daughter, what it’s done to me, to my marriage. I pray to God each day that I might take my daughter’s place. So don’t call me a cancer.”
Or maybe she says, “I am not a cancer.” Either way, she goes on to tell the reader that surely this man, who appears to be in his mid-to-late 70, has had a loved one suffer from cancer, has seen what cancer does to both victim and loved one, and has faced the death from cancer of someone he cares about. The woman begins to cry — she’s angry about crying in front of this man and these strangers in a public place. But she cries.
Now the man is chagrined. He apologizes profusely, asks the woman to forgive him, offers to pay for everything in her cart. But she doesn’t want him to pay. She says, “Tell me, 10 years ago, would you have said something so thoughtless and so cruel to a stranger in a store?” She adds, “Be honest.” As if in asking for honesty, we will be given some guarantee.
The man says, “No.”
Ten years ago, he would never have said such a thing. He wonders what he can do, and the woman asks him to throw away his MAGA hat. Maybe if he throws the hat away, he will once again be the more compassionate person he once was. Leaving the store, the man does what the woman has asked, taking off his hat and tossing it into the trash bin.
Now the clerk recovers the power of speech and says something like, “Oh, my God. That was unbelievable.”
The first comment below this story was to ask if the woman would throw away her Liberal AF T-shirt. This seemed to me beside the point because the woman had not verbally attacked the man. The comment obscures the fact that I have no idea if the event really happened. 
It’s a heartening story, and I hope it happened. I hope that when pushed, we see the limitations of our bitterness towards others and the truth that wishing others didn’t exist will never get us anywhere in our search for a just and fair democracy, a society in which all are treated with equal concern, where all stand an equal chance to make a life that is personally enriching in community with others, both those we feel are like us and those we imagine are unlike us.
Maybe it doesn’t matter if the event actually took place. Maybe what matters is its inner truth, that we can be changed by opening ourselves to the other. And if we were to do this, I think my doubts about the sources of information I receive might go away, that I could trust what I saw — even on Facebook — because we’d have no need to manipulate one another in public in pursuit of our private ends.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Across panels and speeches on the second day of the North Carolina AFL-CIO convention on Thursday, labor activists called to fight back against the Trump administration’s federal layoffs and funding cuts.
Amid deep cuts to the federal workforce brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda, speakers at the labor convention said unions must present a united front or risk losing hard-fought worker protections and many of their jobs entirely.
Christine Surrette, who serves as vice president of District 4 of the American Federation of Government Employees, warned federal layoffs — which have cut more than 200,000 government employees since January — will slow economic growth and erode public safety.
“It’s going to affect our veteran hospitals, our veterans — a lot of veterans are being laid off,” Surrette said. “I mean, National Park Services, we don’t have enough people to work for them now.”
Those impacts, she said, are not contained to the federal workforce. “There will be no work for the contractors,” she said. “No matter what union we’re in, what city we’re in, it’s across the nation.”
Alvin Warwick, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 342 in Greensboro, said the end of Biden era programs around clean energy and electric vehicles have cost more than 10,000 jobs in the sector.
“Terminating these tax credits is the equivalent of terminating 1,000 Keystone XL pipelines,” he said. “It stands to be the biggest job-killing program in history.”

Jemma Superville, an assistant director with National Nurses United, said politicians are demonizing workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs and stripping resources from the department as part of a long term effort to privatize the agency entirely.
“Our veterans have worked and have earned the right to their benefits, and therefore it means that we will stand with them to ensure that they get those rights,” she said. “We will not back down from that. We are the fiercest advocate to ensure therefore the protection of veterans, and we accept that role very seriously.”
She warned that privatization would only make health services for veterans more unreliable, remarking that when she tried to schedule a procedure to remove a small skin tag on her shoulder, she could not get one before February 2026. “Could you imagine, to deal with our veterans with their highly specialized issues, for which they don’t have the skills or the knowledge to deal with it?”
A registered nurse at the VA, Superville urged members of Congress to support the Protect America’s Workforce Act and the VA Employee Fairness Act — calling on them to sign discharge petitions to bring the bills to a vote.
Duke Graduate Student Union member Noah Jacobs said federal cuts have largely manifested on campus in the form of lost research funding from the National Institutes of Health as well as for Duke Health, the university’s medical services and education system. Those cuts have manifested in lost jobs for workers.
“What we’re seeing so far is the Duke administration has decided to make sweeping 10% cuts across the board, all departments — but of course, those cuts have not been equal. You all may have read the news that Duke cut 1,000 staff people’s jobs,” he said. “Basically, Duke’s administrative strategy has been staying silent in the wake of all these attacks.”
Jacobs said he was proud that his union was able to come to an agreement on their first contract with the university after two years of negotiations, expressing hope that it would help protect workers in the face of federal threats. He said as far as he was aware, all staff cuts were to non-union positions.
NC AFL-CIO general counsel Trisha Pande spoke on changes to the National Labor Relations Board under the Trump administration, recapping the president’s removal of the agency’s general counsel as well as of member Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman appointed to the board. She also outlined the Trump administration’s termination of contracts with federal workers’ unions on grounds of national security.

“There’s no sugarcoating it — our labor laws and our federal agencies are under attack. But unions have come together to challenge those attacks in court,” Pande said. “We are fighting not only through legal action, but with our voices, our votes, and our solidarity.”
April Verrett, president of the Service Employees International Union — a two million member union that reunited with AFL-CIO in January — also urged labor organizers to challenge the administration in a speech Thursday. She condemned not only labor actions by the Trump administration, but the mobilization of the National Guard in American cities and raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement throughout the country.
“We are organizing everywhere, in airports, in hospitals, in classrooms, in courthouses and in coffee shops. We are not just playing defense,” Verrett said. “We are taking the fight directly to corporations and the politicians in their pockets who think that we’ll stay silent.?Because we know the truth. We know that it is our power that they want to dismantle. It is our power that they want to decimate.”
Verrett said labor activists need to turn to “radical imagination” to empower them to stand up against violations of their rights.
“We are not going to be afraid, we are not going to be divided, ’cause we got to be ready,” she said. “We are ready for a country where every job comes with dignity, not disrespect. We are ready for health care that heals, that does not bankrupt. We are ready for wages to let you live and not just barely survive.”
On the first day of the NC AFL-CIO’s annual gathering, Gov. Josh Stein urged lawmakers to back an economic agenda that centers working families by improving access to child care, education, and health services. NC AFL-CIO members will select a successor to longtime president MaryBe McMillan on Friday.
Following the conclusion of the convention Friday afternoon, members of the nurse’s union and supporters plan to demonstrate at Sen. Ted Budd’s Wilmington office in protest of cuts to the VA. Superville, the NNU speaker, told audience members it will be a “defining moment” in their fight to win back labor protections.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9113779-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

In its budget request released this month, the department said the supplemental budget request is needed to pay providers on time — because Medicaid expenses are forecasted to go above the agency’s set budget for fiscal year 2026, which ends in June 2026. 
If providers aren’t paid, it could “lead to providers no longer contracting with Idaho Medicaid, impacting availability of services for those in need,” according to the budget request. 
Recent cuts to provider pay rates, expected to save nearly $30 million this year, prevented the supplemental budget request from being even bigger, said Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron, who will soon become the director of the Department of Health and Welfare.
The rising Medicaid costs that drove the need for the supplemental budget request stem from higher health care costs — with more people seeking health care services, and more intense services, she said.

 Request comes amid tough year for Idaho’s state budget 

Supplemental budget requests are common for Medicaid because the program’s budget is set based on projections that could be wrong.
But this supplemental budget request comes as Idaho faces a tough year for the state’s budget. 
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

Last month, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state government agencies besides public schools to cut their budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall. But the budget shortfall estimate didn’t account for tax cuts in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
After the governor’s executive order for mid-year budget cuts, Health and Welfare announced it would cut Medicaid reimbursement rates for all provider types and services by 4%. The agency is accepting public comments on the cuts, which are already in effect. 
The supplemental budget request for Medicaid faces a tough path forward, said State Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Boise Democrat who serves on the Legislature’s powerful budget-setting committee.
“What is happening currently is that you’re seeing the Republicans who are controlling the Legislature being more and more hostile to the vital services that Medicaid provides for working families,” Wintrow said in an interview. 
“We would not be having this discussion had it not been for $400 million in tax rebates, $50 million in voucher schemes that we said — I hate to say I told you so — we said would break the bank,” she continued. “And now the bank is broken. And we are here trying to fund basic services for people with disabilities, people who are aging, pregnant women and kids.”
 After budget holdbacks, Health and Welfare expects to spend less money than the Legislature, Gov. Little approved

The supplemental request was included as part of Health and Welfare’s budget request for fiscal year 2027, which begins in July 2026. 
The Department of Health and Welfare expects to spend less money this fiscal year than the Legislature and the governor initially approved this spring, anticipating about $5.99 billion in expenses compared to the $6.01 billion in appropriations. The budget request for fiscal year 2027 — which includes estimates of how much the agency will spend this year — already accounts for the governor’s ordered 3% mid-year budget cuts, Charron told the Sun. 
For fiscal year 2027, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare — which is Idaho’s largest state government agency — requested about 4.1% more funds in the next fiscal year than it expects to spend this fiscal year. 
If approved, the agency’s budget next fiscal year would grow from about $6 billion a year to $6.23 billion — by nearly a quarter billion dollars. 
Nearly $3 million next year would go toward implementing a sweeping Medicaid cost-cutting law passed this year, which called for work requirements, changes to how officials verify Medicaid eligibility, and a shift to private companies managing benefits.

The agency is also gearing up to downsize staffing to about 2,905 full-time positions next fiscal year, down from the 2,990 it expects to have this year and even lower than the nearly 3,030 it was approved to have this year. 
The budget request is one of the first major steps in the process to fund state government. 
In January, the governor typically releases his own proposed state budget. Then the Idaho Legislature, which usually meets during the first few months of the year, considers budget requests by state agencies and the governor as lawmakers craft budget bills.
 Medicaid’s budget is based on projections. That’s why it often has supplemental budget requests. 

Medicaid often has requests for additional funds in the middle of the state’s fiscal year — which are called supplemental budget requests. That’s because the program’s budget is set based on estimates that can change, but its responsibilities are spelled out in state and federal law. 
Earlier this year, the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee approved $415.2 million in supplemental funds for Medicaid last fiscal year. But in 2024, the budget-setting committee accepted a nearly $278 million reversion from Medicaid for funds the program was allotted but didn’t spend in fiscal year 2024. 
Idaho Medicaid administrator Juliet Charron testified before the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on House Bill 345 on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Charron said the rising costs that required the supplemental budget request this fiscal year were largely driven by the traditional Medicaid population, which includes groups such as children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, rather than people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, which is a policy that covers lower income earners.
Agency officials are still digging into that to see whether specific services are driving the increasing costs, Charron said. 
“But I think what we’re also seeing is that the Legislature has made some really important investments in services, because we have historically had access issues and needed to make some rate increases,” she said. “… Access has opened up, and so we’re seeing individuals receiving services.”
If the $60 million supplemental Medicaid request isn’t approved for fiscal year 2026, “provider payments will need to be held until” fiscal year 2027, according to the budget request, and the same amount will be needed then. 
An error with Luma — the state’s new business system that been the subject of critical audits — also drove the supplemental budget request, officials say. Charron said about $22 million in general funds were supposed to have been released in the state’s 2025 fiscal year, but instead got released this fiscal year. 
 Medicaid work requirements, twice-a-year eligibility checks included in budget request for fiscal year 2027

For fiscal year 2027, Health and Welfare also requested roughly $2.9 million to go toward work to implement a Medicaid cost-cutting law passed this year, through the Idaho Legislature’s House Bill 345, and the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
One request for $1.87 million would go toward Medicaid work requirements, which would include changing the eligibility system to process and track work requirements and exemptions, finding a vendor for work management, and supporting “participants in securing full-time employment, ideally with benefits or at a sufficient wage to allow them to purchase coverage” through the state’s insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, according to the budget request. Funding for that request would be split between federal funds and the state’s general fund.
A separate $1 million request would go toward changing Medicaid eligibility systems to shift toward twice-a-year annual eligibility checks, up from the once annual checks in place now. That change would be mostly funded by the federal government, which would contribute $900,000, compared to Idaho’s contributions of $100,000 from the state’s general fund.
Both requests call for new staff — for a total of 17 positions. But the agency said it will transfer funding for vacant positions for the roles.

The audit reviewed the tribe’s financial records from 2024, when the tribe’s former chairman resigned amid reports of an alleged investigation into his use of a separate credit card for Coushatta Casino and Resort, which the tribe owns and operates.
Louisiana state law requires independent financial audits for indigenous tribes that own casinos. The same requirement applies under federal law for any organization that receives $1 million or more in annual government assistance.    
The audit results were made public last week by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office. In addition to an overall look at the tribe’s financial standing, the review included credit card charges from two unspecified months last year totaling more than $387,000.

The review by the SJT Group accounting firm of Albuquerque, New Mexico, found there were no receipts for $105,416 worth of purchases over the two-month period. Tribal policy requires all credit card purchases above $50 to have supporting receipts that must be produced monthly for the spending to be properly categorized. 
Auditors reported 344 purchases without supporting receipts, and that 167 of the sampled transactions had no associated business documentation to account for $100,254 of the total reviewed charges. 
The review also included $73,515 in travel expenses charged to the tribal credit card. According to the audit report, “all travel-related credit card charges should include a travel request
form, stating the business purpose of the transaction.” Tribal policy also requires an expense report for any travel paid for with its credit cards.
The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana’s tribal council declined to answer specific questions about the audit. In a statement to the Illuminator through spokeswoman Mary Patricia Wray, the tribal council said it has taken steps to improve its financial accountability, including eliminating council credit cards and adopting a formal expense reporting and reimbursement policy. 
“This Council is proud that we have put in place more accountability measures, but disappointed those efforts were not cited or recognized in the audit report from our partners at the State of Louisiana,” the statement said.
Tribal secretary and treasurer Kristian Poncho will complete a review of credit card policies by the end of September, according to the tribe’s response to the report provided to the legislative auditor. 
The stricter measures come after former tribal chairman Jonathan Cernek resigned in August 2024, according to a KPLC-TV report. Other news outlets have reported Cernek is allegedly under investigation by the FBI, the National Indian Gaming Commission and Louisiana State Police. Cernek is reported to have made at least $350,000 in personal charges on two casino credit cards.

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton said Thursday he favors sending a federal-state combo “strike force” into Memphis to cut down on gang activity there.
In the latest episode of “To deploy or not to deploy,” Sexton told reporters he and other state officials are talking to the Trump administration about sending National Guard troops to the West Tennessee city. The Crossville Republican said he supports more federal resources in Memphis with limited use of Guard personnel, possibly at night to maintain law and order.
In addition to a role for the National Guard there, Sexton said the state needs to activate an “anti-gang unit” or “strike force.”
“There’s over a hundred gangs in Memphis right now that are doing most of the crime damage and shootings and everything,” Sexton said.
The speaker said newly-appointed U.S. Attorney Mike Dunavant could help with prosecutions, bypassing Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who is considered soft on crime by Republican lawmakers.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order two weeks ago directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to set up quick strike forces that could be deployed in the nation’s largest cities.
Tennessee governor not ready to deploy troops to Memphis

Gov. Bill Lee, who sent Tennessee Guard troops to Washington, D.C., said last week anything is possible with deployment, changing his tune a bit after saying the previous week that sending troops to Memphis wasn’t under consideration. Initially, he defended his stance by pointing toward a 15% decrease in Memphis crime over the past year.
Democratic state Rep. Jesse Chism of Memphis last week responded to calls for an audit of the Memphis Police crime report by saying the efforts of the agency shouldn’t be doubted, nor should the National Guard occupy Memphis.
“The barometer’s going in the right direction,” Chism told the Lookout Thursday, referring to the same crime report as Lee. “I’m afraid that if you bring in troops that know nothing about the city or people in it, the unintended consequences would be people being harassed or detained for no reason other than misinformation.”
Trump ordered the California National Guard to Los Angeles this summer in response to protests over his immigration deportation policies, then sent in Marines. Gov. Gavin Newsom sued Trump, and one court ruled the president broke the law.










I’m afraid that if you bring in troops that know nothing about the city or people in it, the unintended consequences would be people being harassed or detained for no reason other than misinformation.


– Rep. Jesse Chism, D-Memphis


In Tennessee’s case, Republican leaders are more willing to side with the president. 
Sexton didn’t appear quite as enthused about putting troops on the streets of Nashville, which he said isn’t in the White House conversation for deployment.
Still, because of Trump’s concerns about cracking down on crime, he cautioned local government leaders to focus on law enforcement to protect residents and tourists.

Who’s really to blame
Silicon Ranch’s Matt Beasley was sitting on the front row at an Aug. 18 Future Farmers of America breakfast when he got the bad news: The solar industry is destroying Tennessee’s farmland.
Those weren’t the specific words he heard from U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, but they’re close. Rollins told a crowd of hundreds at the Wilson County Fairgrounds that the federal government, in a “misguided ideological vision,” became an “abettor of farmland destruction.”
“That’s exactly what is happening with the removal of farmland from production so that thousands of fields of solar panels can be built upon them,” Rollins said.
Beasley said he immediately started receiving text messages that morning from lawmakers and Farm Bureau people. 
“All these groups were saying, ‘Are you here?’ Nobody expected it, and I certainly didn’t,” Beasley told the Lookout.

As part of her missive, Rollins introduced a Trump administration policy rolling back part of the Biden New Green Deal, ending all USDA subsidies for solar operations that take prime farmland out of production. Rollins justified the policy with the claim that Tennessee lost 1.2 million acres in the last 30 years and that by 2027 some 2 million acres of Tennessee farmland will be lost. She failed to mention, though, that solar panels account for only a minute part of that.
“It’s a complete red herring,” Beasley said of her statements.
In fact, an independent state study found that solar facilities are not the primary contributor to farmland loss. Residential and business development are the main culprits.
Additionally, the Tennessee Valley Authority set a goal of obtaining 10,000 megawatts annually from solar energy by 2035. If all of that power source came from Tennessee, one of seven TVA states, it would still take less than 1% of the state’s farmland, Beasley said.
Granted, solar panels aren’t exactly the most beautiful sight. People would much rather see a field of grazing cattle.
Those same people who moved into a new neighborhood built on the land of a deceased farmer don’t want anyone else building across the road, either. 
But since former Gov. Phil Bredesen, his sidekick Matt Kisber and Reagan Farr founded Silicon Ranch in 2011, they’ve taken a new turn toward ag production.
Using what is called agrivoltaics, the company raises sheep on some of its solar ranches. The animals don’t bother the panels, and they keep the grass down and fertilize the land.










It’s a complete red herring. 


– Matt Beasley, Silicon Ranch, of Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins' claim the solar industry is destroying farmland 


“If you deploy agrivoltaics, you’re still generating agricultural production on that land. It’s not being taken away, it’s being added to,” Beasley said.
The Trump administration’s dislike for solar energy is bound to hurt the diversification of power, but solar-related companies are moving ahead regardless.
Highland Materials, which makes polysilicon materials for solar panels, is set to build a plant in Hawkins County after receiving funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. It expects to produce 20,000 metric tons of the material at peak operation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association reports the industry installed nearly 18 gigawatts of new capacity in the first half of 2025, accounting for 82% of all new power, despite Trump’s policies. Yet the industry is in danger of losing 44 gigawatts of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline.
Oddly enough, the group’s report found that 77% of solar capacity installed this year took place in states won by Trump, Republican strongholds such as Texas, Indiana, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas. (That’s almost the Southeastern Conference)
That statistic could show that people support a stronger power grid but remain likely to accept political rhetoric that has little basis in fact.

Is this grounds for …
The federal judge handling the corruption trial of former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, made a bit of a faux pas during a phone hearing this week.
U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson repeatedly referred Cynthia Sherwood, the attorney for Cothren, as “Ms. Cothren.” It’s not clear how many other people besides a Lookout reporter caught the mistake.
But after a short break in the proceedings, Sherwood raised the matter with the judge and added that she knew he knew her name.
Richardson apologized and said he was so focused on Cothren’s issues that he misspoke. “It matters a lot to him and the government as well,” Richardson said.
The question remains, though: With attorneys for Casada and Cothren pulling out all the stops, could this be grounds for a mistrial?

The state released the results of the tour on Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (West Virginia Department of Human Services photo)The state released the results of its foster care “listening tour,” and the findings reiterated many problems already well-known in West Virginia’s troubled system — like the need for expanded access to child mental health care and improved communication with families and caregivers.
“Nearly everyone described a culture more focused on blame than solving problems,” the report said. 
The West Virginia Department of Human Services paid $348,000 for Chicago-based Guidehouse advisory firm to facilitate the meetings and produce the report, which was released Wednesday. Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who wants to fix foster care, signed off on an emergency spending request for the project. 
The report follows eight in-person sessions and 11 virtual meetings where DoHS and the consulting firm brought together foster parents, biological parents, social workers, legal professionals and more to share concerns and solutions for West Virginia foster care.
“Foster parents and kinship caregivers said they feared losing placements for raising concerns,” the report said. “Biological parents echoed this — sharing experiences of how questioning decisions have triggered delays or stricter oversight. This fear silences feedback, hinders transparency, and deepens power imbalances.”
DoHS Bureau for Social Services Commissioner Lorie Bragg said in a news release that the report reflects challenges as well as opportunities for change. 
“We are taking the stories, concerns and solutions we heard and using them to guide next steps in policy, practice and training. We remain committed to ensuring this process stays collaborative and transparent,” she said. 
There are more than 6,000 children in the state’s foster care system, and West Virginia far outpaces other states in the number of children coming into care. 
Hundreds of West Virginians shared their experiences and ideas to improve the state’s foster care system during the listening tour, DoHS said.
According to the report, families and youth in West Virginia foster care “experience a revolving door of caseworkers and [guardian ad litems] — some reporting four or more in a single case.”
“Turnover, burnout and vacancies create chaos, forcing parents, youth, judges and caregivers to re-explain, re-engage and rebuild trust with each other from scratch,” the report said. 
The state’s courts system, overwhelmed by child abuse and neglect cases, is struggling to keep up with the case load. During foster care listening sessions, parents and caregivers shared that their hearings had been delayed for months or even years. 
There’s also a need to create consistency across the state in how child welfare cases are handled by courts and Child Protective Services workers. 
“A striking theme was the uneven experience between different counties and workers. Many participants perceived that the ‘same case’ could play out differently depending on the judge, the worker, or the region — with uneven application of timelines, visitation, reunification standards and basic case procedures,” the report said.
DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer has already said improving consistency and implementing processes was one of his major focuses for child welfare.
The report also noted that the state needs to expand access to mental health and wraparound services as the state is woefully short on providers who can help children dealing with trauma-induced behavioral issues. The shortage of child mental health providers and in-state treatment beds has led the state to send foster children to out-of-state facilities.
A news release from DoHS outlined next steps, saying the department will convene a stakeholder advisory committee. They plan to use the report’s findings “to shape workforce initiatives, strengthen prevention efforts and enhance support for children and families.”
Alex J. Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services
“Releasing this report is more than just documenting what we heard, it is a commitment to act,” Mayer said. “The voices of families, caregivers and caseworkers will help shape policy and practice changes that move us toward a stronger, more supportive child welfare system.”
The report suggested that the state could end its reliance on out-of-state placements by expanding in-state therapeutic options and recruiting more specialized homes.
Earlier this week, Mayer told lawmakers at the state Capitol that there were around 600 foster children living in out-of-state group homes. Eighteen children were living in a hotel as of Monday.
“These children are not staying in hotels because we don’t have enough beds, because we don’t have enough foster parents. It’s a lot to do with the complexities and the challenges that these children are facing,” he said. “And you know, we’ve been working and continue to work with our providers to better understand the needs of these children, and how we can help them boost their capacity and their ability to support these youth.”
Last year, the state spent nearly $70 million paying to house foster children in out-of-state facilities. DoHS is considering the possibility of how they could build in-state facilities to serve these children who often need specialized behavioral care.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young was told earlier this week that Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and President Donald Trump “were considering deploying the National Guard and other resources to Memphis,” Young said in a written statement, officially confirming rumors that have spread across Memphis.
The confirmation that Trump has considered deployment to Memphis comes after the president threatened to send military forces to other Democrat-led cities, a move that some legal and military leaders have raised concerns as threatening democracy and possibly disregarding state laws.
This month, a federal judge in California ruled that Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles this summer was illegal. In Washington, D.C., the district’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit to stop the deployment of the National Guard troops, calling it “illegal.”

Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris described his concerns about these deployments in a statement on Facebook Thursday, saying, “I’ve been to countries where there isn’t freedom but there is military presence, where you can’t protest, and officials stay in power for as long as they want. That’s not America. Sadly, with the occupation of US cities, we are far down this road of losing our democracy.”
Harris did not directly mention the plans for Memphis in his post.
It’s unclear now whether or when the National Guard will be deployed to Memphis, but a source familiar with Young’s conversations told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism that it is likely to occur in the next two to four weeks.
 Young says financial resources, patrol officers needed

In his written statement, Young said he is “committed to working to ensure any efforts strengthen our community and build on our progress.”
And despite the concerns about the erosion of democracy, Young framed his response around crime, which Trump has used to argue for these deployments.






“We agree with Governor Lee that effective support for Memphis comes through focused initiatives that deliver results like we have seen with the FBI, state troopers, and other law enforcement partnerships. What we need most are financial resources for intervention and prevention, additional patrol officers, and case support to strengthen MPD’s investigations,” he said. “Memphis is already making measurable progress in bringing down crime, and we support initiatives that help accelerate the pace of the work our officers, community partners, and residents are doing every day.”
Earlier this week, the Memphis Police Department touted historic crime reductions, reporting decreases across all major categories in the first eight months of 2025.
Some of Tennessee’s congressional Republicans — including U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles and U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger — have called for the national guard to be deployed in Memphis and Nashville. In a letter to Lee sent Wednesday, State Rep. Torrey Harris blasted the idea that Memphis is a dangerous city that requires “intimidation by military force.”










We agree with Governor Lee that effective support for Memphis comes through focused initiatives that deliver results like we have seen with the FBI, state troopers, and other law enforcement partnerships.


– Memphis Mayor Paul Young


“The idea that a federal figure would even threaten to deploy armed troops into our neighborhoods is nothing short of horrific. It is a slap in the face to our democracy, our state sovereignty, and to the very residents who already struggle daily against systemic disinvestment,” he wrote.
Tennessee Code addresses the governor’s power to order the National Guard into active service. That power comes “in case of invasion, disaster, insurrection, riot, attack, or combination” and  “not to exceed the duration of the emergency for which they may be called.”
Alternately, the governing body of a city or county — in this case the Memphis City Council or Shelby County Board of Commissioners — can request by resolution that the governor call on the National Guard if “there is a breakdown of law and order, a grievous breach of the peace, a riot, resistance to process of this state, or disaster, or imminent danger thereof.”
Keedran Franklin, a small business owner and professional organizer, said he spoke with Young on Wednesday and that Young told him he doesn’t want the National Guard to come to Memphis, and that he’d asked Lee to hold off on sending them.
Franklin said the deployment of the National Guard to Memphis could cause “some type of chaos and panic.”
“What happens here is they start federalizing the police departments even more, start federalizing these local agencies even more. People’s charges will start being federal more,” Franklin said. “It’s dangerous for us, but I think it’s time for everybody to say something, to stand with each other.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/200531-FloydProtest-0920-scaled.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

Van Orden's social media posts following the assassination of Charlie Kirk blame Democrat and journalists and predict 'civil war.'| (Screenshot via Zoom)Fruitless thoughts and prayers. Familiar calls for de-escalating toxic partisanship. Promises to do something about the teen mental health crisis, violent video games, the epidemic of alienation and hopelessness. By now we are all accustomed to the ritual reactions to routine incidents of horrific gun violence that plague our country like no other wealthy nation on Earth, where firearms are the leading cause of death for children.
But if the usual, feckless responses to gun violence are maddening in a country that can’t get its act together to pass even marginal, commonsense gun safety measures, the reaction of Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden to the hideous assassination of rightwing provocateur Charlie Kirk this week was downright reprehensible.
As soon as the news broke that Kirk was shot while on stage at Utah Valley University, Van Orden began a stream of increasingly unhinged social media posts blaming Democrats and the media for the murder and declaring “the gloves are off.”
“The leftwing political violence must stop now,” Van Orden tweeted. In another post he wrote, “The left and their policies are leading America into a civil war. And they want it. Just like the democrat party wanted our 1st civil war.”
Contrast that with the statements from other Wisconsin politicians. 
Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said, “there is no two ways about this: political violence has no place in America. I am keeping Charlie and his family in my thoughts in this truly horrifying moment.”
Van Orden’s fellow Wisconsin Republican, U.S. Rep. Tony Wied said, “There is absolutely zero place for political violence in our country.” 
“Violence against anyone because of their political beliefs is wrong. Violence against others is wrong,”  Gov. Tony Evers said. “Violence is never the answer for resolving our differences or disagreements. Wisconsin joins in praying for Charlie Kirk and the Utah Valley community and first responders.”
None of those statements mollified Van Orden, who told reporters in the U.S. Capitol that “every one of you” is responsible for Kirk’s death.
Reposting a news clip of Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who called for the nation to de-escalate political violence and come together, Van Orden wrote, “Too late. You have sown the wind.”
“I am not sure they understand what they have done,” Van Orden ranted. “They missed in Butler, but it is on now.” 
Never mind that in Butler, Pennsylvania, the would-be assassin who targeted President Donald Trump was a registered Republican. Or that, as Van Orden spewed accusations against Democrats and journalists, the identity of the shooter who targeted Charlie Kirk was still unknown. When a reporter pointed that out to Van Orden, he replied, “You know what? Knock it off.”
Actually, it’s Van Orden who needs to knock it off.
Seizing on political violence to try to stoke more political violence is as dangerous as it is disgusting.
Far from recognizing the human tragedy for all of us as our country descends into this nightmare, Van Orden capitalizes on murder, whether the victims are liberals or conservatives, imposing the same crude narrative about a war with violent leftists every time.
After the horrible double murder of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, Van Orden falsely characterized the suspected shooter, a right-wing religious fanatic whose list of intended targets included Democrats and abortion providers, as an anti-Trump protester who “decided to murder and attempt to murder some politicians that were not far Left enough for them.” 
He seems to revel in the prospect of more violence. Unfortunately, his tone is matched by Trump, who issued his own threatening statement, politicizing the attack and claiming that it is part of a pattern of leftwing attacks on conservatives. “For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,” Trump said. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence.”
Of course, it is Trump who has a long history of inviting political violence against Democrats and members of the press. Van Orden is copying him by escalating that rhetoric in Wisconsin. 
Online, Van Orden’s belligerent posts got mixed reviews. Some people demanded that he explain what he means when he says “the gloves are off,” condemning him for encouraging hooliganism. “So you plan on using this to start Civil War II?” one person posted. “You don’t think things through before you say them.
You people fantasize about killing your fellow Americans like it’s a full-time job.”
Others celebrated his statements. “No other way to fix it at this point,” one of Van Orden’s followers replied to his post. “We need a 2-3 day national purge. We do business with whatever is left of the left.” Appended to the comment was a GIF celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse for shooting Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha.
It’s unlikely that Van Orden, who has been unwilling to face his own constituents at an in-person town hall will actually lead the violent attacks against his fellow Americans he fantasizes about online. But feeding that violent fantasy is clearly inspiring for some people. And that’s exactly why it’s got to stop.

The report examines the nationwide housing affordability crisis impacting workers across all income levels. The authors cite “decades of underbuilding, rising interest rates, and wage stagnation” for pushing homeownership and rental housing further out of reach for many workers. It used its Paycheck to Paycheck database to track affordability changes in 390 metropolitan statistical areas from 2019 to 2024. The authors shared case studies from Asheville, Boise, Idaho, Houston, Tampa, Florida and Seattle.

“These findings underscore the depth and breadth of the housing crisis, which is increasingly pricing out working families across the country—regardless of geography or profession,” said David M. Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference. “The housing affordability crisis is now hitting families in every metro area, for nearly every occupation.”
Here are findings from the other four case studies:

Boise, Idaho: Home prices increased by over 60% in just five years. A middle school staff saw teachers, librarians, and counselors priced out of two-bedroom rental units by 2023, with librarians still unable to afford rent in 2024.
Houston: Despite high rates of homebuilding, only 28 of 286 occupations can afford to purchase a home with 10% down in 2024. Order Clerks and Customer Service Representatives cannot afford even a one-bedroom rental.
Seattle: Not a single occupation tracked could afford to buy a home in 2024, including Dentists earning over $200,000. Only 50 out of 285 occupations can afford a two-bedroom rental.
Tampa, Florida: Only 11 of 284 occupations can afford to buy a home. Legal Assistants, earning $62,420, cannot afford rent for a one-bedroom apartment.

“This is no longer a problem we can frame as affecting only certain groups or regions. From big cities to small towns, Americans who work hard, earn solid incomes, and contribute to their communities are finding that neither renting nor buying is within reach,” Dworkin said. “If we don’t address the supply shortage, reform zoning, and invest in housing at all income levels, we are facing a fundamental threat to the health and sustainability of our economy.”
The study found that beginning with a notable spike from 2019-2020, fairly-priced rents for one-bedroom apartments in Asheville increased 30% and 26% for two bedroom apartment. The $59,840 needed to afford a one-bedroom apartment in the city in 2024 represented a nearly $28,000 increase over the salary needed to do so in 2019. The $67,200 annual salary needed to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Asheville is a $27,000 increase from 2019 costs.
A typical construction site has about 13 occupations ranging from architectural and civil drafters and architectural and engineering managers to helpers for electricians, carpenters and plumbers, according to the report.
In 2019, three  — construction laborers, electrician helpers and roofer — of the 13 occupations in Asheville could not afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment, according to the report. By 2024, the authors found that five additional occupations earned less than the $59,840 to needed to afford a one-bedroom apartment in the city.
Across  269 occupations tracked in Asheville in 2024, only 66 could afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment. Fewer than half could — 97 — could afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment.
Meanwhile, to afford a typical home in the Asheville metropolitan statistical area, the authors found a buyer needed more than double the income necessary five years ago. With a 10% downpayment, a buyer needed to earn $70,678 in 2019. By 2024, a buyer needed to earn $143,507 a year to purchase the same home.
Of the 390 metropolitan statistical areas sampled, 176 require a six-figure salary to purchase a home with only 10% down. One-hundred and fifty of them are outside of California, a state where home prices are typically higher and 64 are in non coastal communities. Another 150 metropolitan statistical areas require incomes between $75,000 and $99,999 to purchase a home. In 2019 only 30 of those metropolitan statistical areas required a six-figure income to purchase a home with a 10% downpayment and 43 required income between $75,000 and $99,999.
“In five short years homeownership became unattainable for thousands of combinations of MSAs [metropolitan statistical areas] and occupations from insurance sales agents in Akron, Ohio, to electrical power line Installers and repairers in Worcester, Massachusetts,” the authors wrote. “Renting a modest two-bedroom apartment became unaffordable for many others, including public safety telecommunicators in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and news analysts, reporters, and journalists in Wichita, Kansas.”  
Here are more findings from the report:

Homeownership Costs Have Surged: In 125 MSAs, the income needed to purchase has doubled or more since 2019.
Renting Is Increasingly Unaffordable: Nearly half (47%) of tracked occupations cannot afford a two-bedroom apartment, compared to 38% in 2019. In 32 MSAs, the salary needed to comfortably rent exceeds $75,000.
Wages Lag Far Behind Costs: Even traditionally high-earning professionals are losing housing access. In Seattle, dentists cannot afford to buy a typically priced home; in Asheville, civil engineers are priced out despite earning nearly $100,000.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4799-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 06:57:06.594479

(Photo courtesy of John Dekhane)During World War II, tyranny and destruction swept over continents, and the very foundations of our freedom stood in peril. In the face of such danger, communities across Idaho didn’t hesitate.
From the shores of Lake Coeur d’Alene to the quiet streets of Boise, men and women from every corner of the state stepped forward and answered the call to serve their beloved country. They asked for no recognition or reward, yet history will forever remember them as heroes.
Among the courageous men who left Idaho but never came home was Flying Officer Audrey Allen Ayres.
Flying Officer Audrey Allen Ayres
Born on April 26, 1919, in Eagle, Idaho, Audrey was the cherished son of Charles Rufus and Mabel Edith Ayres. He grew up in the Boise area with his sisters, and was raised with the values of integrity, hard work, and selflessness. Audrey was known for his kind spirit and gentle nature — qualities that earned him the affection and admiration of all who knew him.
At the age of 18, Audrey decided to enlist in the U.S. Navy, where he served four years aboard the battleship USS Idaho. Life at sea demanded focus, discipline, and strength, and despite his young age, Audrey embraced it with commitment and resolve. Year after year, he came to embody the true meaning of loyalty, responsibility, and honor, as he proudly fulfilled his duties at sea.
After his honorable discharge in June 1941 — just months before America entered World War II — Audrey made another remarkable decision. Though he had already served at sea, he felt a profound calling to defend the ideals he believed in. Determined to confront the forces of tyranny in the skies, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and underwent rigorous training.
Guided by the values instilled in him in Idaho, Audrey became a wireless operator and air gunner with 429 Squadron, flying aboard Halifax bombers. Mission after mission, he flew over enemy-held territory, risking his life for a cause greater than himself.
On Jan. 20, 1944, Audrey and his crewmates took off from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, England, on a mission to destroy military targets in Berlin. During the raid, their aircraft was struck by enemy fire and crashed, killing him instantly. On that fateful day, the man who had served at sea and fought in the skies was taken from the world. Audrey was only 24 years old, with so much life ahead, and so much yet to live.
The news of Audrey’s death sent shockwaves through the entire Boise community, leaving his family, friends, and neighbors utterly heartbroken. His parents carried the pain of his loss to their graves — Mabel passing in 1949 and Charles in 1976 — forever marked by the sorrow of losing their son. Audrey’s sisters, who had grown up alongside him in Idaho, held his memory close throughout their long lives, cherishing the bond they shared with a brother taken far too soon.

Audrey was initially buried near the crash site in Germany, but after the war, his remains were transferred to the Berlin 1939–1945 War Cemetery in western Berlin, where he lies among thousands of fellow Commonwealth heroes who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom. Back home, a memorial marker was installed at Star Cemetery in Star, where his loved ones could come to mourn, to cry, to reflect, and to feel close to Audrey. That place became a sacred space — a symbol of love, loss, and eternal remembrance.
It is our solemn duty to commemorate Flying Officer Audrey Allen Ayres and to honor a legacy carved through sacrifice, devotion, and bravery. His story echoes those of countless heroes from Idaho who left their homes, families, and dreams behind to help turn the tide of war in humanity’s darkest hour.
Though their voices were silenced by an unforgiving war, their spirit remains woven into the fabric of Idaho — and their memory will endure, so long as we choose to carry their story forward.

Jimmy Higdon, 72, said he’s happy to leave at a career peak in his time as a lawmaker, but he has […]","Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, presents Senate Bill 4, an act relating to sick leave for members of the Teachers’ Retirement System, during a meeting of the Senate State and Local Government Committee. (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A longtime Republican lawmaker who will not seek reelection next year still has a few policies he wants to check off before leaving office. 
In a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, 72, said he’s happy to leave at a career peak in his time as a lawmaker, but he has a few transportation priorities he wants to address during his final legislative session in 2026. 
Announcing his decision to not seek reelection last week, Higdon said spending more time with his family was a key factor in his decision. The Lebanon Republican told the Lantern that he anticipates quality candidates will run for the 14th Senate District seat, which represents LaRue, Marion, Nelson, Spencer and Washington counties. Higdon was elected to the Senate in 2009. Before that, he was in the House beginning in 2003.
“I think part of leadership is knowing when to say when and to pass the torch,” Higdon said. “I’ve seen too many of my colleagues stay too long, and I don’t want to be that guy.”
Higdon is the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, which often debates infrastructure projects across Kentucky. During his last session, he hopes to introduce a comprehensive bill that would “modernize Kentucky’s transportation system.” Higdon said issues he wants to address include changing the state’s fuel formula tax and introducing a user fee for commercial electric vehicles. 
Separate from that, Higdon is passionate about reducing distracted driving in Kentucky. Texting while driving already is illegal in Kentucky. The legislation he has in mind would go beyond that. Higdon has worked on iterations of the legislation in the past, but they haven’t made it through the General Assembly. A bill he co-sponsored this year would have prohibited drivers from using personal communication devices in ways that require the driver to reach for the device or press more than one button to activate it. 
Whenever Higdon sees a report of a car accident, he said he asks himself if it could have been prevented with such a law. 
He anticipates some pushback, particularly by those who would argue the bill would create a “nanny state,” but he wants to trudge on. 
“Driving is not a right, it’s a privilege and we need to keep our roads safe,” Higdon said.

Another transportation issue that has made headlines over the summer are Kentucky’s regional driver’s licensing offices, which the legislature created in 2020 to replace offices in each county. Earlier this year, the Transportation Cabinet revoked 1,985 driver’s licenses because of irregularities. A whistleblower alleges that workers in a regional office in Louisville were supplying driver’s licenses to immigrants who were not eligible to receive them in exchange for $200.
Higdon said he is helping another Republican lawmaker, Sen. Aaron Reed of Shelbyville, craft legislation. Higdon added that he supports local offices having the ability to oversee some processes, like issuing renewal licenses and permit testing to eliminate lines at regional offices and save people in rural communities a long commute to run an errand. 
“We know there needs to be something done. It’s probably not going to be a full overhaul. I think we would go back to square one, and we’re just not ready for that right now,” Higdon said. “It needs to be well thought out, well planned.”
Higdon’s committee also often discusses recovery and repairs following natural disasters. In recent years, Kentucky has been the site of devastating tornadoes and floods that have caused damage to roads, bridges and other structures. 
Kentucky has “plenty experience” with disasters, Higdon said, adding that lawmakers have set aside extra funding in the state budget to address any unforeseen circumstances. He also commended the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s response under Secretary Jim Gray. 
At the national level, FEMA has come under scrutiny as President Donald Trump has floated the idea of dismantling the federal agency and moving its responsibilities back to the states. 
Higdon said that he agrees with the idea that states’ emergency response teams can oversee immediate response as local teams often know communities better. However, he does think that states need federal funding to help rebuild after disasters. 
“We need that money from the federal government, too, for that recovery and that type of help,” Higdon added. 
Higdon has also made headway with Republicans on pension policies in the last few years. He is a co-chair of the Public Pension Oversight Board. He said his biggest accomplishment was getting leaders, staff and the General Assembly to more thoroughly vet and analyze the impact on the state budget before approving changes to public pensions —  “to understand and to have policies in place that we don’t do shortcuts on pensions.” Higdon argued that shortcuts  in the past led to problems now. 
Some of those policies include having the legislation fully go through the process. Also any pension bill must be vetted by the oversight board and have an actuarial analysis. 
‘A friend’
Higdon’s colleagues in the Senate noted his friendship and willingness to listen. In a statement about Higdon’s decision to not seek reelection, Republican Senate President Robert Stivers called Higdon a “a trusted colleague and a steady hand in the Senate.” 
“Most of all, he’s been a friend. His leadership on transportation, pensions, judicial matters, veterans’ issues, and numerous other areas has made an undeniable difference for Kentucky, and he will leave a lasting legislative legacy deeply woven into the fabric of this commonwealth,” Stivers said. 
Across the aisle, Louisville Democratic Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong said she has always enjoyed working with Higdon and appreciated him discussing how decisions about transportation projects are made during her first year in office. She is a new member of the transportation committee. 
“I do think he does a really good job of listening to members about what the needs are in their community and being fair about how he is allocating resources to different types of projects,” Chambers Armstrong added. 
Higdon said he found mentoring newcomers to the legislature enjoyable and that they were often grateful for the help. He encouraged his colleagues to do that after he leaves office. 
He also had some parting advice for fellow Republicans: “Just do the right thing for the right reasons, and the rest of it will take care of itself.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/higdon020724-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 05:58:23.578231

(Photo by Meghan McIntyre/Virginia Mercury)Virginia has outpaced the national average in Medicaid spending, an analysis of data by groups of pharmacists found. The state agency that oversees Medicaid benefits have countered that the group’s report is based on “inaccurate” data that it is working to correct.
Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency and Strategic DirectionsRX conducted an analysis of state Medicaid prescription drug spending between 2017 and 2023. It found that Virginia has spent between $1,000 more to $1 million more than the national average in recent years. 
Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS), contracts with Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) to manage the benefits of Medicaid enrollees. The MCOs then contract with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). The PBMs act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs also retain rebates and discounts from contracts but some consumers and pharmacies have said they are unsure how much savings are actually being passed on. 
That question often stems from the fact that some MCOs and PBMs are vertically integrated — meaning that they’re part of a larger company that owns health care facilities, pharmacies or health systems. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced this week that his office is investigating some entities to ensure that insulin prices, a critical drug for managing diabetes, was not artificially inflated in violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. 
Miyares’ office investigating pharmacy benefit managers, manufacturers over insulin prices

This year, lawmakers also passed legislation to create a single state-contracted PBM to handle Medicaid in Virginia and Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed it. 
The goal, supporters said, is to increase transparency, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. Virginia’s next gubernatorial administration will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of that law. The PBM reform law was one of the proposed solutions outlined in the pharmacists’ report, and one of its authors supported the bill during this year’s legislative session. 
“When (rebates) gets passed around through companies that have multiple arms that manage multiple parts of the flow of this money, that’s when you start seeing prices go way up,” said Jeremy Counts, a Blacksburg-area pharmacist who worked on the analysis for the report. 
The new report indicates that Virginia’s Medicaid prescription drug plans are returning 20% of gross drug spending back to Medicaid through manufacturer rebates. The national average is about 68%, for comparison, the report read. 
“The state is being charged a very high price for generic medications,” Counts added. 
By “moving to a system that isn’t controlled by the MCOs and their PBMs” the state can set different reimbursement rates, he said. Counts also suggested this could help take burdens off pharmacies, which have experienced more closures. 
The National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, is a national benchmark for prescription drug prices – both generic and brand-name — and is developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This represents the average price pharmacies pay for drugs from wholesalers and is a national standard other payers use to set reimbursement rates. 
The math of the solution, Counts explained on a call, is to calculate the NADAC rate of a drug plus whatever the state’s dispensing fee is. Even without the PBM reform bill, he suggested that DMAS could order MCOs to rework their NADAC models. 
“That makes your pharmacies break even,” Counts said. 
 DMAS reporting errors

In light of Counts’ revelations, DMAS said Thursday that he had worked with data that stemmed from an error the agency is already working on correcting. The agency said they alerted Counts about the incorrect data “prior to him publishing the analysis.” 
In a statement to The Mercury, DMAS shared that the department is working to correct the data and resubmit it “as soon as possible” and that it is undertaking a General Assembly-directed study of its pharmacy delivery system.
DMAS also shared a letter it recently wrote to Counts where Virginia Health and Human Services secretary Janet Kelly noted an error that caused DMAS to “significantly overreport pharmacy spending to CMS beginning in 2019.”
It was flagged by Dels. Kieth Hodges, R-Middlesex and Otto Wachsmann, R-Brunswick — both of whom have pharmacy backgrounds. Though Counts’ report was already complete by Sep. 4, this is when DMAS informed him that he’d worked with numbers they are working to fix. 
“DMAS is actively working to rectify the reporting error and agency leadership has offered to provide the corrected information to Pharmacists United for Truth & Transparency as soon as it is verified and available,” Kelly wrote. 
Counts said the organizations “stand by our report” but that they “remain committed to working with Secretary Kelly and DMAS.” 
“We hope to hear from her office soon so we may continue to work cooperatively for the betterment of Commonwealth citizens,” Counts wrote on behalf of the organizations.

On Sept. 16, 1663, the Virginia General Assembly passed Act XIV, establishing Sept. 13 as a perpetual holiday to commemorate the suppression of the Gloucester Conspiracy. Although this holiday was soon forgotten, it is worth considering its reinstatement, for reasons that differ significantly from those originally intended.
The Gloucester Conspiracy, also known as the Servant’s Plot or the Poropotank Servant’s Revolt, is one of the earliest and most significant uprisings involving enslaved individuals and indentured servants in colonial Virginia. This event culminated in several arrests for treason, and the execution and beheading of four individuals.
This plot followed only two years after the York County Conspiracy of 1661, where 40 servants conspired to revolt under their enslaver, Maj. James Goodwin. Although quickly suppressed with no arrests, the York conspiracy demonstrated the growing discontent among Virginia’s indentured labor force and prompted the General Assembly to pass two acts mandating better treatment of servants and the enslaved.
The Gloucester plot comprised a diverse group of English, Irish, African, and Indian indentured servants and enslaved people, even convict laborers transported from British jails, making it one of the first instances of multi-ethnic collaboration in colonial resistance.
The conspiracy transpired on Sept. 1, 1663, when John Gunter, William Bell, Richard Darbishire, John Hayte, Thomas Jones, William Ball, William Poultey, William Bendell, and Thomas Collins secretly met at Peter Knight’s home near Cooks Quarter. The conspirators appointed Bell and Gunter as their leaders. The group agreed to reconvene at midnight the following Sunday, Sept. 6, at Poplar Spring, with each participant ordered to bring whatever weapons they could beg, scavenge or steal for the uprising.
The plan was to march from Poplar Spring first to the home of Lt. Colonel Francis Willis, a member of the governor’s council. There they intended to seize more weapons and demand their release from indentures. A potential second destination was the Green Spring home of Gov. William Berkeley, where they would demand that all indentured servants who were normally required to serve seven years of indenture be released after one year. Many wanted to kill Beverley and Willis if they refused to cooperate.
As with many colonial-era insurrections, such as Gabriel’s Rebellion, an infiltrator betrayed the Gloucester plot. John Birkenhead, a servant of Maj. John Smith, revealed the plan to  Berkeley, who arranged for the conspirators to be ambushed during their gathering at Poplar Spring. Citing divine intervention, the governor said it was “God’s hands” that had delivered “so transcendent a favour as the preserving all we have from so utter ruin.”
With the plot foiled, the nine captured conspirators faced trial for high treason before the General Court in Williamsburg, marking the first time colonial authorities treated servant rebellion as an act of war rather than merely a labor dispute. Determined to make examples of the servants, the court accused them of attempting “utterly to deprive, depose, cast downe and disinherite” the governor. Additionally, the conspirators were charged with planning to wage war against Virginia to “wholy submit and destroy” the still fledgling colony.
The harsh sentences reflected the court’s determination to send a simple but definitive message about the consequences of insurrection. Robert Beverley Jr. wrote in 1705 that four of the nine convicted conspirators—Bell, Gunter, and two unnamed—were executed by hanging. In addition, some historical accounts note that “several bloody heads dangled from local chimney tops as a gruesome warning to others.”
For his betrayal, Birkenhead gained his freedom from indentured servitude and received 5,000 pounds of tobacco, a substantial amount that represented years of earnings for most colonists.
The General Assembly thus voted to make Sept. 13 (presumably the day the final depositions were taken) a perpetual holiday: “Resolved that the 13th of September be annually kept holy, being the day those villains intended to put the plot in execution.” Also, in 1670,  Berkeley issued an order prohibiting Britain’s worst criminals from being imported to Virginia, citing “the horror yet remaining amongst us of the barbourous designe of such villaines in September 1663.”
Virginia should reassess the historical significance of Sept. 13 by reclaiming the date not as a commemoration of colonial authority’s suppression of rebellion, but as a day to honor the resistance, courage, and aspirations of those who, despite overwhelming odds, sought to break free from bondage and assert their humanity. Honoring these individuals would affirm the state’s commitment to a more inclusive and truthful telling of its history.

(Photo by Susan Tebben, Ohio Capital Journal.)With the introduction of a Democratic-proposed map and the announcement of a bipartisan committee on the subject, Ohio lawmakers have officially begun the process of congressional redistricting. So what happens now?
Ohio is restarting its congressional redistricting process, not because of any special push from leadership or even a response to a spontaneous redraw.
Ohio is making a new congressional map because they are legally bound to, as a consequence of a lack of bipartisan agreement in 2022, the last time congressional maps were adopted in the state.
To have maps for the 2026 election, the legislature is starting again.
How redistricting works
Redistricting has been a topic of conversation in Ohio for many years. In 2020, the U.S. Census conducted its official population survey, a landmark time when redistricting happens across the country.
The number of districts that are drawn for both state legislative districts and congressional ones are based on the population shifts recorded in the census conducted every 10 years.
The political leanings of those districts is in theory supposed to come from the voting trends of the state and country.
The GOP-created congressional districts approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission on March 2, 2022.
Congressional district mapmakers often look to the most recent presidential elections for help in how those districts should be shaped.
Republicans currently control 10 of 15 of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional district seats, or 66%. Ohio voted for President Trump in 2024 with 55% of the vote.
The Republican majority that leads the legislature has argued that the 66% Republican majority that was adopted in the March 2022 congressional map represents the political makeup of the state.
Amid a national gerrymandering frenzy, prominent Republicans have called for the party to take two or three more seats. Meanwhile, Ohio Democrats have proposed a map that would lean eight seats Republican to seven seats Democratic, a 53-47 split.
The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, a national analysis of all redistricting efforts, gave the current 10-5 split map an overall “D” grade, with its lowest marks given in partisan fairness.
Democrats unsurprisingly disagreed that the map aligned with the views of the voters, and have maintained that disagreement through their new map proposal introduced on Tuesday.
What the Ohio Constitution says
The district redrawing process is laid out in an amendment to the Ohio Constitution passed by voters in 2018 with nearly 75% support, which spells out not only deadlines for the process, but also how the maps should look once the lines are drawn.
The drawing of congressional districts and legislative districts has certain standards, but some “mandatory standards” for statehouse districts are “general standards” for congressional districts, according to a legislative brief on the process.
For congressional districts, the general standards for a map include contiguity, or districts with “a single, unbroken shape, with no ‘islands’ of territory that do not touch the rest of the district.”
The districts should also be compact and keep counties, townships and municipal corporations whole as much as possible.
“Splitting a political subdivision is necessary when, for example, its population exceeds the ideal district population,” the Legislative Service Commission wrote in its analysis of the redistricting process.
Next steps and deadlines
A joint committee on congressional redistricting has announced they will meet for the first time on Sept. 22. A time and location has not been announced by legislative leadership.
The legislature has until Sept. 30 to approve a congressional map following the constitutional rules. That map must have approval of three-fifths of both chambers of the legislature, including at least half the Democrats.

During consideration of the map proposals by the legislature, proposals are assigned bill numbers, and a committee will hold public hearings on the bills before they can be sent to the full chamber for a vote.
Advocates across the state are hoping the General Assembly will keep to the constitution in holding a transparent process that allows the public time to review maps before they’re voted on, and provide public input.
“You don’t get a fair map without a fair process,” said Bria Bennett, a spokesperson for the Equal Districts Coalition, in a statement. “Closed-door drafting, limits on public testimony and ignored constitutional criteria are not routine politics; they’re power grabs that cheat Ohio voters out of fair representation in Congress.”
Without bipartisan approval, the legislature can’t pass a map, and if the deadline passes without agreement, the process moves on to the Ohio Redistricting Commission.
The seven-person commission is made up of mostly majority party members, as dictated by the redistricting constitutional amendment.
The Senate president, House speaker, Senate minority leader, and House minority leader can all choose to serve on the commission or appoint another member of their chamber to serve.
The governor, auditor, and secretary of state are all required to be on the commission.
With the current make-up of statewide officeholders, this means the Ohio Redistricting Commission has a 5-2, Republican-to-Democratic split.
Public hearings should be held by the commission as well on any proposed maps, before their deadline of Oct. 31.
The rules state the group must also come up with bipartisan support to adopt a new map.
A lack of agreement in the commission means the process goes back to the legislature, who has a final deadline of Nov. 30 to come up with a congressional map.
This time, while the legislature has to follow specific constitutional rules to do so, the legislature can pass a map with a simple majority, rather than the 66% needed in the original attempt.
In order to pass a map with a simple majority, the congressional districts “must not unduly favor or disfavor a political party or its incumbents,” lawmakers are prohibited from improperly splitting counties, townships and municipal corporations, and the General Assembly “must attempt, but is not required, to draw districts that are compact,” according to a Legislative Service Commission brief.
The 6-1 Republican Ohio Supreme Court has jurisdiction over any legal challenges to the map that may happen after it’s passed.
Both previous congressional maps were challenged, and both maps were found by a previous bipartisan 4-3 court majority to be unconstitutionally partisan, favoring the Republicans more than aligned with voting trends.
The makeup of justices on the state’s highest court has changed since then, and now holds a firm Republican majority of 6 to 1.
The Republican swing vote in both the previous congressional redistricting decisions was Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, who has since retired. Current Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy was on the court for those cases and voted to reject the challenges.
If the congressional plan should get struck down as unconstitutional, the legislature has 30 days to adopt a new plan after appeals have been exhausted.
If the legislature still can’t agree or misses the deadline, the Ohio Redistricting Commission is once again brought in with another 30-day deadline.

(Getty Images)About a third of the parking lot of the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua spills over into Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. It’s a geographical quirk that means if shoppers park in the southern lot near the JCPenny or Buffalo Wild Wings, they could find themselves crossing state lines multiple times during their visit. 
But for the attorneys general of New Hampshire and 24 other Republican-led states, it’s a novelty that highlights what they say is a problem with Massachusetts’ gun laws. 
A New Hampshire resident who might be legally carrying a firearm on the New Hampshire side of the parking lot might find that same firearm illegal to carry to the Massachusetts side without a permit.
The 25 states say that arrangement is unconstitutional. This month, they’re taking that argument to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“If that person is carrying a firearm without a Massachusetts license — which would be constitutionally protected activity in most of the mall — that person risks being charged as a felon and facing mandatory incarceration in Massachusetts,” reads a brief from the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office to the U.S. Supreme Court, speaking about a visitor to the Pheasant Lane Mall. 
Led by New Hampshire, the states have come together to support the efforts of Philip Marquis, of Rochester, New Hampshire, to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to protect non-Massachusetts residents from the Bay State’s firearms regulations. In an amici — or “friend of the court” — brief, lawyers at the New Hampshire Department of Justice say Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law should not apply to travelers from other states passing through.
Also joining the amici brief are the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  
The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, meanwhile, asserts the law can apply to visitors and is constitutional. And the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has agreed. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the case, the conservative majority could apply a landmark 2022 decision that limited state firearms regulations to rule in favor of Marquis. And the result could dramatically change relations between gun-owning New Hampshire residents and those of its southern neighbor.
But the Supreme Court has been hesitant to take up challenges to gun laws in recent years that could help clarify its 2022 decision. And that has meant a backlog of cases against state firearm restrictions — and potentially the Marquis case — have been left unresolved recently, according to Joseph Blocher, a law professor and co-founder of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.
“I think the pressure is high on the Supreme Court to weigh in again. But they have not,” Blocher said in an interview. “They did not show much of an appetite for it for most of the last 20 years.”
Marquis previously brought a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the state’s court system, arguing that the state’s concealed carry firearms permit law is unnecessarily burdensome to out-of-state visitors. In March, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied his claims and ruled that the state law passed constitutional muster. 
Now, Marquis is requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule the Massachusetts high court’s decision on federal constitutional grounds. In order for that to happen, the federal court must grant Marquis a “writ of certiorari,” which would allow them to accept arguments and hold an oral hearing.
For Marquis, the effort is personal; he is trying to overturn a conviction. In 2022, Marquis was driving on Interstate 495 when he got into an accident and pulled his car into the breakdown lane, according to his legal petition. At the time, he had an unloaded pistol in his pocket. When state police officers arrived to talk to him, Marquis announced that he had the pistol and removed it from his pocket. 
He told police officers that he did not have a Massachusetts firearm license, but that he is legally allowed to carry a concealed firearm in New Hampshire because he has not been disqualified under federal law. New Hampshire state law allows the automatic concealed carry of firearms for anyone not federally disqualified; Massachusetts requires residents and non-residents to obtain a license by paying $100 and receiving approval from the colonel of the state police.
Because he was carrying the gun without a license, police charged Marquis with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition under Massachusetts state law, and a lower court convicted him.
Marquis has appealed that decision all the way to the highest Massachusetts court, and in doing so he’s invoked a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that has upended state firearms laws. In New York State Rifle & Police Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the court struck down a New York law that required residents to show “proper cause” in order to obtain a concealed carry permit. 
In that decision, the court held that any state law that awards firearms permits on a discretionary basis, known as a “may issue” permitting law, is unconstitutional; only a law that awards permits on strict criteria — a “shall issue” permitting law — could be constitutional under the Second Amendment. And Bruen established that any state firearms restriction must adhere to the historical tradition of firearms regulation dating back to the passage of the Constitution — or be explicitly covered by the Second Amendment itself. 
Now, as Marquis attempts to bring his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, his challenge of the Massachusetts law could represent an opportunity for the court to expand the range of gun rights in the wake of the Bruen decision and limit Massachusetts’ regulatory power.
Neither Marquis nor the Republican attorneys general supporting his lawsuit are attempting to overturn Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law as it applies to Massachusetts residents. But they are seeking to establish that the law should not apply to out-of-state residents whose home states have less restrictive regulations.
And to do it, they are attempting to show that the state law violated Marquis’ Second Amendment right to bear arms and 14th Amendment right to travel and equal protection — and that, following Bruen, no historical reading of those amendments justifies applying Massachusetts’ law to out-of-state residents.
In their briefs, attorneys for Marquis and attorneys for the Republican states argue the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was wrong to decide that the state’s concealed carry permit law qualifies as a “shall issue” permitting law under Bruen. In reality, they say, the decision-making by the state police colonel makes the process a “may issue,” and thus unconstitutional.
In its March ruling, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Marquis did not have standing to sue in Massachusetts court, but that even if he did, his challenge of the state law would not succeed. The court found that the state law passed the Bruen test because it attempts to restrict dangerous people from obtaining firearms, which it held follows historical tradition.  
“To the extent that the Commonwealth restricts the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms within its borders, the justification for so doing is credible, individualized evidence that the person in question would pose a danger if armed,” the state court’s decision read. “Both case law and the historical record unequivocally indicate that this justification is consistent with ‘the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.’”
Clark Neily, the senior vice president for legal studies of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, disagrees. The Cato Institute, a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights, has also filed an amicus brief in Marquis’ petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, in which it argues that a contextual reading of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, indicates that its framers would have intended it to protect the firearms rights of freed slaves traveling to safer states.
“If you’ve been enslaved in Alabama, you sure want to get out of there and go and look for better economic opportunities in other states,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Now, you’re most certainly going to encounter the (Ku Klux Klan) at some point while you’re looking for work in other states. And guess what? You’re going to want to be able to be able to protect yourself, and not have to encounter some state regulation like they have in Massachusetts.” 
It is not clear whether the court will take up Marquis’ appeal, nor when it might make its decision. Despite its decision in Bruen, the conservative court has held back from dramatically expanding the scope of the Second Amendment. In 2024, it narrowed the scope of Bruen‘s in U.S. v. Rahimi, which affirmed the constitutionality of firearm restrictions for defendants in domestic violence case. But it has declined to take up a number of attempts to challenge state firearms restrictions in Democratic-led states, including two cases in Massachusetts, Commonwealth v. Crowder and Zemene v. Commonwealth. 
To Blocher, of the Center for Firearms Law, the question of whether Bruen negates out-of-state firearms license requirements is just one of many legal questions that have emerged in caselaw across the country since the 2022 decision. Federal lower courts are grappling with what Bruen means for gun possession by felons; location-based firearm restriction laws such as gun-free school zones; age restrictions; caps on high-capacity magazines; state bans on assault-style rifles; and more. The historical contextual test Bruen requires has at times provided more uncertainty than clarity, he says. And circuit courts are more likely than ever to split along partisan lines.
“It kind of looks like there’s some real confusion and disagreement,” he said. “Some lower courts are even saying, ‘Look, we’re just not equipped to do this kind of historical analysis. We’ve got busy dockets. We’re not like the Supreme Court. We have to decide more than 70 cases every year, and we don’t have the benefits of experts and friend of court briefs, and this is just impossible for us.'”
With scant action from the Supreme Court, the result has been something of a backlog.
Some Second Amendment advocates, like Neily, say the current John Roberts court has failed to follow through on necessary corrections to firearms laws. 
“The court has not manifested a serious commitment to vindicating the right to keep and bear arms, and one of the ways we can see that is in the numerous cases that it has turned away,” Neily said. 
But the string of denials have given hope to supporters of gun restrictions, for whom Bruen had struck a blow in 2022. 
“Even after Bruen, courts are upholding state, federal, and local gun laws against Second Amendment challenges,” a 2023 legal memo from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence states. “Most courts have recognized that, when properly applied, Bruen allows for a wide range of gun violence prevention laws.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gunconcealed-1024x733.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 05:58:23.578231

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/ Stateline)NORTH CONWAY, N.H. — The conversations in French having given them away, the group of motorcyclists immediately stood out as foreigners over a Saturday breakfast in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
In the restaurant, the server was pleased, thanking them for coming. Because these days, tariffs and White House rhetoric have left Canadians a rare breed of visitors in New England, usually a hotspot vacation destination from the nearby province of Quebec.
“There’s a lot of people staying in Canada because of that,” said Dave Gingras, a 35-year-old biker from Saguenay, about two hours north of Quebec City.
While other Canadians are avoiding buying American products or traveling to the States, the group of 11 decided to leave politics behind on their road trip through New England.
“We are just keeping it neutral and trying to enjoy,” Gingras told Stateline.
After breakfast, they donned helmets and mounted an assortment of dusty Yamaha, BMW and Triumph bikes.
“We drive and when we’re tired, we stop and raise up a tent and relax with a beer,” Gingras said before pulling into a line of crawling traffic on the White Mountain Highway, the scenic byway dotted with quaint inns, old-timey stores and Colonial and Victorian homes.
Across Northeastern states, business owners and state officials have labored to maintain key economic connections with Canada despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House. President Donald Trump’s trade war, aggressive immigration enforcement and talk of making their country the 51st state has offended many Canadians. While concerns are acute in New England, tourism hubs from Hawaii to New York are reeling from a decrease in Canadian visitors.
Number of Canadian tourists visiting New Hampshire down 30% this year, officials say

To quell tensions, Maine leaders erected signs in French to welcome Canadian visitors and New Hampshire’s governor just returned from a Canadian trip she took to strengthen trade and tourism.
But hospitality businesses this summer reported a sharp decline in visitors from the North — Canadian travel to New Hampshire is down about 30% this year, according to state officials. Border crossings into Vermont hit their lowest levels since 2021, according to federal data, as the Canadian government reported a 34% drop in the number of August car visits into the U.S. compared with the same month last year.
New England businesses remain concerned as the region turns the page on the summer vacation season to its vibrant autumn, known for luring leaf-peeping travelers from across the globe.

Tourism is vital for White Mountain Valley communities like North Conway. While it’s home to only about 2,300 people, the village is a historic travel hotspot known for outdoor activities, tax-free shopping and family-friendly theme parks.
While many people think of the area as a winter ski destination, summers are actually the largest travel draw, said Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mt. Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce.
The drop in Canadian tourism has been especially evident during less popular travel times for Americans. For example, Canada’s Victoria Day, a late May holiday celebrating that queen’s birthday, has traditionally brought big crowds to the Northeast.
“Our retail outlets are a very, very popular destination for them during that time,” Proulx said. “And our retail outlets have reported that it was basically nonexistent this year.”
Proulx said local businesses have tried to lure travelers from close-by regions like the Boston area to help make up for the loss of Canadian tourists, “so it’s not an unrecoverable loss.” But the absence of visitors from parts North is hard to ignore.
“It almost feels like a birder might feel if they find a rare species,” he said. “If you see someone with a Canadian license plate, you notice it right away. It gives you a little bit of a smile.”
Aside from the economic loss, Proulx said he worries about longstanding relationships.
This scenic valley is nostalgic for many visitors from the U.S. and Canada alike. He said many people return again and again, sharing fond memories of their first camping trip along the Saco River, childhood trips to the Santa’s Village amusement park and picturesque rides on the Conway Scenic Railroad.
“So we just don’t want anybody thinking that they’re not welcomed here. That’s our biggest thing,” he said. “We want everybody to be able to call this their second home, to be able to visit and reconnect and feel welcomed.”
‘Towns are quieter’
In the heart of North Conway, tourists picnic on the grass in Schouler Park, look into the 1874-era train station and meander into shops selling hokey souvenirs and homemade fudge. Framing the village is the imposing Mount Washington, which at 6,288 feet boasts the tallest peak in the Northeast.
At one of the town’s busiest intersections, the crowds come in waves to the North Conway 5&10 Store. But even as families line up, employee Polly Howe said she hadn’t seen many Canadians this summer.
“It’s a shame,” she said, bouncing between the cash register, the candy counter and stocking staples like toys and hats.
In a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the souvenir shop has been around for 86 years and features a false-front facade, the kind made famous in boomtowns of the Old West. Manager Terri Johnson said she had encountered a good number of Canadians inside the shop, but said she didn’t blame any who felt put off by the political climate.
“I’m thankful they still come after all that,” she said.
It’s not just international relations that have changed tourism here.
A rainy start to the summer season didn’t help, and business owners say anxiety over the domestic economy and inflation have pinched travel budgets.

Mark Lahood says family travel has dipped at the three hotels he operates in the area.
“Towns are quieter,” he said this summer. “They’re not quiet, but they’re much quieter than years’ past.”
Some summer weekends, which traditionally sell out entirely, the three hotels had 30% vacancies, he said. And travelers are more keen for weekend trips than their weeklong road trips of previous seasons.
“With a seven-day trip, by the time they were all in, it’s a lot of driving, it’s a lot of gas money, it’s a lot of meals, it’s a lot of hotels,” he said. “And I think it’s just too much.”
To help with rising costs, he ran a free breakfast promotion for kids earlier in the summer. And he increased an existing international discount for Canadian guests.
“Did it help anything? Probably not. But you know, when you view it from a Canadian traveler, at least you made an effort.”
The decline in Canadian visitors has allowed for more local, spontaneous travel, said Genn Anzaldi, who owns J-Town Deli & Country Store in Jackson, New Hampshire.
“More day trippers for sure,” she said. “So maybe not as many people spending the night or as many nights.”
The scent of sizzling bacon and toasting panini fills her shop, which offers hot meals along with handmade gifts and convenience store staples.
Anzaldi, who also runs a cooperative marketing effort for a group of independent restaurants, said the local restaurant business was down, but not significantly.
The reason?
“Canadians,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s the economy. That seems to be going well.”
About nine miles away from North Conway, things are a bit quieter in Jackson, home to a famed one-lane covered bridge. With its spas and boutique hotels, Anzaldi said the community is more known as a destination for weddings, romantic stays and outdoor getaways.
While Anzaldi said she hopes Canadian tensions settle soon, she noted that the matter lies in the political domain and there’s little business owners can do but carry on.
“We have to run, right?” she said. “We’re not personally going to go up and advertise.”
States try to ease federal tension
 To maintain tourism and trade, Democratic and Republican politicians in the Northeast have made overtures to their counterparts in Canada.
Since Trump’s inauguration, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has met with Maine businesses near the border, embarked on a diplomatic Canadian tour and even installed “Bienvenue Canadiens” welcome signs near border crossings. But on her trip this summer, she was reminded that it’s not just tariffs that have irked Canadians — many are also worried about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.
Ambassador Hoekstra says U.S. and Canadian leaders aiming to mend fences

“Lots of people don’t feel safe in the U.S. right now and for good reason,” Susan Holt, the premier of the New Brunswick province, told Mills, according to local news accounts. Holt has encouraged her constituents to avoid traveling to the United States.
Last year, the state said some 800,000 Canadians visited Maine. On her June trip, Mills asked Canadians to remember those who rely on the tourism industry.
“To the extent people feel angst about coming to Maine, just remember that if they aren’t coming to Maine, the ones that they’re hurting are the small mom and pop businesses,” the governor told News Center Maine while in Halifax.
Mills’ office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Similarly, New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte said ahead of a trade mission that she aimed to welcome Canadians to the Granite State, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported.
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” Ayotte said last month. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
Ayotte’s office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment about her trip.
René Sylvestre, the Quebec province’s delegate to New England, said those gestures are appreciated. He spends much of his time meeting with state and business leaders. Last month, he met numerous state lawmakers at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, where he is posted.
But he said calming federal tensions will be key to seeing a rebound in tourism.
“What we can see right now is people in Quebec are really sad with the whole situation,” he told Stateline. “But they’re saying, ‘Maybe we should stay and spend more time in Canada these days.’ So this is really the impact that we’ve seen, and we think that it’s going to take a while before it’s back to normal.”
A decline in international travel has hit border communities across the country — from New York state to Washington state. North Dakota   estimated that Canadian visitors spent about $14.4 million less in the first half of the year compared with last year, as the number of personal vehicles crossing the border from Canada declined by 30%. Other hubs for international visitors, including Las Vegas and Hawaii, are also seeing significant declines.
“Right now, it’s hard to turn back federal policy,” Hawaii state Sen. Ron Kouchi told Stateline in August.
Kouchi, a Democrat and president of the state Senate, said Canada has traditionally been among Hawaii’s top five travel markets. The state has sent tourism officials to trade shows and is trying to show Canadians, like all visitors, the Aloha State’s iconic hospitality. But he said that message hasn’t been persuasive, even coming from leaders of the solidly liberal state.
“While we argue about Republicans or Democrats, in other nations they simply look at Americans and they don’t see it as an R or a D thing,” he said. “It’s an American thing.”
A stormy beach season
Old Orchard Beach in Maine is a favorite of New Englanders and Canadians alike.
Part of the Portland metropolitan area, the vacation town sports a seaside amusement park and seven miles of sandy beaches. But some Canadians started to cancel their summer reservations to the area early on in Trump’s term.
Sean Nickless, who co-owns the 30-room Crest Motel with his family, said Canadians began calling off trips in January and February,
Those cancellations and poor weather foretold a slower summer. “It’s not as steady,” Nickless said, noting business had been inconsistent with shorter stays.
Rainy skies left few people at the bars and attractions lining the pier at Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 31. Hospitality businesses in this beach vacation town reported thinner crowds this summer as they faced poor weather and a drop in Canadian visitors. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)
Like many of the other beachfront properties here, the retro Crest Motel relies heavily on repeat customers, filled out by the occasional road tripper who ducks in from the angled carport to ask about an available room.
“The best you can do is let Canadians know they’re still welcome here,” he said from the motel’s small lobby scented with the aroma of a drip coffeemaker and a bright popcorn machine.
At the height of summer, rain ushered in what should have been a booming weekend along the Atlantic’s Saco Bay. Crest Motel guests swam, but only under the cover of the pool’s rolling roof.
Down the way, five teenagers stood listlessly inside a walkup Dairy Queen with no customers to serve. On the pier, arcade games, $1-per-visit restrooms and barstools sat idle. Few took up heavily advertised offers for pizza by the slice, $15 lobster rolls or fried clam cakes.
“I’ve never driven around Old Orchard Beach in the summer and seen ‘vacancy signs.’ I  have this year,” said state Sen. Donna Bailey, who represents the community. “I mean, you just never see that in the middle of July — all you see is ‘no vacancy’ signs.” A Democrat, Bailey emphasized that Canada isn’t some far-off destination for Mainers. People routinely cross the border for health care and work. They have friends and family on both sides.
“I mean, there’s some places up in northern Maine that the nearest hospital is in Canada, as opposed to in the United States. You know, some people have their babies over in Canada.”
But aside from emphasizing existing bonds, Bailey said Maine residents and officials were largely at the mercy of the federal government’s actions.
“I think it’s helpful to remind the Canadians of our personal relationship and that we are Maine and we’re Mainers, and so we’re not necessarily the same as the federal government,” she said. “But, yeah, it does only go so far.”

Massive storms brought record-breaking flooding in southeast Wisconsin about a month ago. Preliminary damage assessments conducted by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Wisconsin Emergency Management had suggested that over 1,500 residential structures were destroyed or sustained major damage and total damage costs estimated at over $33 million across three counties. Damage reports had also indicated over $43 million in public sector damage throughout six counties.
Gov. Tony Evers had officially requested a Presidential Disaster Declaration and FEMA funding during the last week of August. His request included access to FEMA’s Individual Assistance and Public Assistance for Milwaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties, which could help residents get reimbursements for costs from flood damage. 
“We had Huge Victories in Wisconsin in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and it is my Honor to deliver BIG for Wisconsinites!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post about approving the FEMA funding. 
U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wrote in a post on X that Trump called him to deliver the news of the approval. 
“Thank you to President Trump for continuing to deliver BIG TIME for Wisconsinites,” Johnson said. He also thanked U.S. Reps. Bryan Steil and Scott Fitzgerald for helping to lead the push for the assistance.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore had also called for the funding. 
“It’s been more than a month since disaster hit Wisconsin, and families are hurting. I have been fighting for these funds because Wisconsinites need help and they need it now,” Baldwin said in a statement. “I’ll continue to closely monitor to make sure Wisconsin gets everything we need to be on the road to recovery and the whole-of-government recovery effort does right by all Wisconsinites.”

But on Aug. 29, the Trump administration put New England’s irreplaceable roadless areas in its crosshairs for logging and development by announcing its intent to rescind the “Roadless Rule.” More than one-fifth of the White and Green Mountain National Forests are at risk.
America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.
For a quarter century, the Roadless Rule has provided an essential layer of protection for 58.5 million acres of our national forests, or about a third of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Here in New England, the rule safeguards 260,000 acres of the White and Green Mountain National Forests (WMNF and GMNF), including iconic landscapes like New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, Mount Moosilauke, Mount Chocorua, and the Presidential Range. Portions of Vermont’s famous White Rocks National Recreation Area were spared from road construction and clearcuts in an ongoing 14,000-acre logging project only because of the Roadless Rule.
For an administration that has made big claims about improving government efficiency, rescinding the Roadless Rule may be among its most foolish stunts yet. The Forest Service has a $10.8 billion road maintenance backlog on its 370,000-mile road network, more miles of road than are managed by any other state or federal agency. Those roads — enough to circle the Earth 14 times — degrade water quality, worsen flooding, fragment important habitat, and endanger communities by facilitating human ignitions of wildfires.
Recognizing the exceptional value of Inventoried Roadless Areas (totaling just 2% of the lower-48 states), the agency promulgated the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule as “a down payment on the well-being of future generations,” in the words of former Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who oversaw the rule’s development. Over 1.5 million Americans submitted comments in support of the rule, a record for public participation in federal rulemaking.
The irreplaceable landscapes protected by the Roadless Rule were central to the cultures and well-being of Indigenous people across North America prior to European colonization, and they remain important today. Randy Kritkausky of Vermont, a federally enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, wrote that: “Repeal of the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would literally make permanent and devastating inroads into protected National Forests which are, for many Indigenous Peoples, our primary connection with unspoiled ancestral lands. This threat is not only ecological, it is profoundly spiritual.”










America can’t afford to lose its roadless areas.


Only 3.3% of New England is protected from timber harvest and road construction, but scientists broadly agree we must protect at least 10% of the region for the benefit of biodiversity, the climate, and the well-being of our communities. Rescinding the Roadless Rule would set our region back, making our conservation goals harder to achieve than ever.
We have learned all too well what will happen to roadless lands if the Roadless Rule is rescinded. Over the last two decades, the Forest Service has systematically targeted roadless areas for logging that were inventoried after 2001 and lack the protections afforded by the Roadless Rule. In the GMNF, a single project approved in 2019 will cut 6,000 roadless acres, including more than 4,000 acres of clearcuts and similar “even-aged” harvests. A new WMNF project proposes nearly 1,000-acres of roadless area logging, including about 200 acres of clearcuts.
Standing Trees is litigating to stop this reckless destruction, but a political solution is required in the long run. That’s why we’re grateful to members of Congress, including many here in New England, who have signed onto the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 (RACA), which would make the 2001 Roadless Rule permanent.
RACA is an essential step to stopping the Trump administration’s attacks and maintaining existing protections, but ultimately, our precious national forests deserve even stronger safeguards. New England’s state and federal public lands, spanning just 11% of the landscape, are worth far more to our regional economy when left intact. It’s time to reinvigorate the discussion of expanding congressionally designated wildlands across our two national forests, or even converting the forests to national parks.
In the short term, the clock is ticking to defend the Roadless Rule — and you can make yourself heard by submitting a comment.
In the words of retired Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, “The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a landmark accomplishment of the USDA Forest Service. …The Roadless Rule is working for America’s National Forest System and it’s working for the American taxpayer. As we say, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’”

Javier Zayas Photography/Getty ImagesGeorgia residents may face an uphill battle accessing COVID-19 vaccines this fall, as federal agencies consider sweeping changes to eligibility requirements for immunizations.
The process of updating vaccine guidelines — which for many years has been a matter of routine — is now increasingly uncertain amid shifting federal guidance on public health policies. And in the absence of a federal consensus, states are beginning to develop their own vaccine policies. Northeast and western states are forming new vaccine coalitions to provide access to residents who might not qualify under potential future Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, while Florida has announced plans to eliminate vaccine mandates altogether.
But Georgia, which is home to the Atlanta-based CDC, has held off on administering updated state guidelines — at least for now. Last week, the state’s Department of Public Health announced that it will be halting distribution of the newest version of the COVID-19 vaccine until after the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issues its annual recommendations. The panel is scheduled to meet in Atlanta from Sept. 18-19.
CDC vaccine panel abruptly overhauled by RFK Jr. says it will review childhood vaccination schedules

Established in 1964, ACIP is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations also play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible immunizations are for the public to access. Georgia is also one of a handful of states that have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, giving the panel’s decisions more weight than it has in some neighboring states.
In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is tasked with overseeing vaccine development, approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines aimed at providing immunity against the JN.1 variant. However, the new recommendations limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older.
Part of the reason patients may have trouble accessing vaccines, advocates say, is because health care providers are uncertain about how to interpret new state and federal guidelines, and don’t want to risk violating the law.
“Usually, all of these groups and all of these people are in lockstep,” said Scott Thorpe, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Public Health Leadership. “They’re obviously not in lockstep right now, and so that’s part of why this process is breaking down, and it creates a lot of uncertainty for everybody.”
New Covid shots arriving in pharmacies. Why you may need a prescription – for now

If the CDC’s panel votes in favor of similar restrictions, Georgia residents who do not fit the eligibility criteria may be required to get a prescription before they can be given a COVID-19 booster shot, and pay for the full cost out of pocket. Georgia’s public health department said the out-of-pocket cost for last year’s vaccine was around $180.
Members of Georgia’s Board of Public Health, some of whom are former CDC employees, expressed skepticism about the upcoming ACIP recommendations at Tuesday’s board meeting. Board Chair Dr. James Curran, who previously spent more than two decades working at the CDC, criticized the “turmoil and huge morale problems” the agency has been facing in the wake of a deadly shooting and recent turnover of top officials.
“As far as I can tell, a major goal is to diminish the CDC role in vaccines in a lot of ways,” Curran told the board.
“What we can expect is very controversial guidance which will focus on vaccine injuries more than on vaccine expansion,” he added.
Georgia Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey stressed that the department is still “very committed to immunizations,” and said she has been in contact with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp as the department considers next steps. A Kemp spokesperson did not respond to questions about the governor’s stance on COVID-19 vaccine access.
“We are waiting to see the CDC/ACIP guidelines,” Toomey said, adding that the federal guidelines will also impact insurance and liability coverage for vaccines. “If it is really out of line with what we feel is appropriate, given the science and epidemiologic trends as we know it, we can make decisions then.”

New polling for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group paints a picture of Massachusetts residents mostly happy with their health care coverage, especially when compared with other states, even while large slices of the population report struggling with cost and access.
The post New poll shows high satisfaction with health insurance in M[...]","MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS ARE largely content with their health care quality and coverage, according to a new CommonWealth Beacon poll. But digging beneath the high level of satisfaction reveals access and cost issues leading to delayed care for residents across the Commonwealth. 
One third of residents say they have skipped or delayed seeking care due to cost in the last year, and 25 percent say cost led them to skip or delay seeking care for a dependent. Even getting that care can be a time gamble. A fifth of the state’s residents say they’ve had to wait more than two months for a primary care appointment, and 16 percent have had to wait that long for a specialist. 
The sweeping poll on heath care access for CommonWealth Beacon conducted by the MassINC Polling Group – which is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC – ran from August 11 to 18 and surveyed 1,000 Massachusetts residents with a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (Topline | Crosstabs)  

It paints a picture of Massachusetts residents mostly happy with their health care coverage, especially when compared with other states, even while large slices of the population report struggling with cost and access.  
“There can be two truths,” said Steve Walsh, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association. “It can be true that we’re doing well, and it can also be true that we need to do better. And there is no doubt that health care costs are rising. It’s making it harder on employers, including our health care institutions – which are our largest employer in the Commonwealth – so the cost of care impacts their ability to invest in workforce and cutting-edge technologies as well.”  
“I don’t necessarily see [the poll results] as an outlier,” he added. “I see it as that we’re getting incredibly good care here, but we need to be more focused on making sure it’s affordable.” 
Massachusetts is highly insured – around 2 percent of the state is without some type of insurance coverage – and generally able to access care. A plurality (41 percent) of residents reported an employer plan as their primary source of health insurance, with 23 percent each saying MassHealth/Medicaid or Medicare.  
The vast majority of residents say they are either very satisfied (40 percent) or somewhat satisfied (36 percent) with their health insurance, with about the same sentiment for people whose care they manage.

When it comes to the selection of primary care physicians nearby covered by their health insurance, residents again largely report being very (42 percent) or somewhat (33 percent) satisfied, and similarly pleased with their selection of specialists. 
Given an open-ended question about how they would describe the health care system in Massachusetts, responses generally reflected three things: it’s excellent, it’s pricey, and it’s slow. 
“We have very good health providers in this area,” said a 54-year-old Chicopee woman. “There are just not enough doctors to provide care.”  
Respondents ranked Massachusetts highly compared to other states. Some 42 percent of residents said Massachusetts is one of the top states in terms of the quality of health care, which is in line with national rankings from groups like The Commonwealth Fund. The Bay State topped the country in overall rankings of health system performance, which aims to capture affordable health coverage, good-quality care, and the opportunity to live a healthy life. Another 27 percent of residents said Massachusetts care quality was above average, and just 2 percent said it was probably one of the worst states. 

These answers grew more positive with income and education level. While just a third of residents making less than $50,000 a year and 27 percent of those with a high school education or less said Massachusetts was one of the top states for health care quality, half of those making over $100,000 annually and 58 percent of those with advanced degrees identified it as a top state. 
One possible explanation for that discrepancy, said Rich Parr, vice president of the MassINC Polling Group, is “that quality is uneven and weighted towards those who can afford it.” 
Massachusetts has the fourth highest per capita health care spending in the country, according to KFF research. The state Health Policy Commission noted in 2024 that Massachusetts is the state with the second highest family health insurance premiums, including out of pocket spending, with the average annual cost of health care for a family exceeding $29,000. 
The Commonwealth Fund, in its national rankings, asks adults if they went without care in the last year due to cost. Its 2025 report using data from 2023 found that 7 percent of adults in Massachusetts went without care in the last year, and only 9 percent of state residents lacked “a usual source of care.” 
The MassINC Polling Group poll, however, included those who have delayed and skipped care in the last year – 33 percent of residents overall and 37 percent of residents making less than $75,000 a year. The Health Policy Commission in 2024 reported 40 percent of their survey respondents (and 48 percent of those with income below $50,000) said they are putting off seeing a doctor or going to a hospital, with cost being the major factor. 
Yet even as poll respondents decried the price of coverage, 30 percent think that Massachusetts health costs are middle of the pack compared to other states, with 10 percent saying it is one of the worst states and 13 percent one of the top states. 

Forty percent hold insurance companies most responsible for the cost of health care, with 16 percent blaming companies that own hospitals and medical practices, and 10 percent saying the costs are due to too many government regulations. 
State insurance regulators this year issued regulatory guidance requiring insurance companies to limit the growth of deductibles and co-pays for patients to the rate of inflation for medical care, Gov. Maura Healey’s office noted. They also negotiated a reduction in proposed insurance rates and approved $75.6 million in rebates to over 350,000 people covered by individual and small employer plans in Massachusetts. 

“The data bear out that we have a real cost challenge and a real system under stress,” said Doug Howgate, president of the business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. “It can be helpful to compare ourselves to other states, but we also need to take a look at what these impacts mean for our health care system, our state budget.”  
The state has to begin identifying issues including but not limited to federal Medicaid cuts that could lead to large swaths of people losing their coverage, he said, because “we know there are going to be additional stressors placed on that system over the next few years.” 
On Thursday, Howgate’s organization released an analysis of the looming costs of President Donald Trump’s recent sprawling tax and spend bill. Changes to federal Medicaid policy could reduce MassHealth enrollment by up to 200,000 members and significantly increase burdens on the state’s Health Safety Net. The cost of care for uninsured residents is covered through the safety net, which currently has a funding shortfall of approximately $290 million and reimburses providers at rates far below MassHealth. The changes could increase health safety net demand by up to $510 million, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. 
“Removing thousands of MassHealth members from consistent coverage is likely to worsen long-term health outcomes and reduce the largest and most consistent source of funding for community health centers and safety net hospitals already under significant fiscal strain,” the report’s authors wrote. 
Residents seem to be feeling those strains. While almost 40 percent told pollsters they waited less than two weeks between scheduling and having a primary care appointment, 12 percent said it took three to four weeks, 12 percent said one to two months, and 20 percent said it took more than two months. 
“Healthcare in Massachusetts is difficult to navigate,” said a 40-year-old woman in Freetown. “Not enough PCPs, wait months for the ‘soonest’ appointment, and when you get the appointment it’s a turn and burn visit. Typically, the wait in the lobby is longer than the appointment.” 

Residents in Southeast Massachusetts reported the longest waits – more than a quarter had to wait more than two months for a primary care appointment. Residents in the Greater Boston area, which boasts the highest density of population and health care facilities, were most likely to report three-week to two-month waits. 
“I think the health care system in MA is just ok, not great,” wrote a 42-year-old man from Revere. “In my experience there are always very long waits when scheduling appointments, sometimes many months out. However, these problems probably exist everywhere, and I think MA is likely handling them better than other states.” 
State health officials are trying to address the primary care crisis and related spending in part through a dedicated task force under the Health Policy Commission. Healey’s office also highlighted two bills that she signed, which lower health care costs, cap prescription drug co-pays at $25, improve access to primary care, and increase oversight of the health care industry to protect patients and providers. 
 “Massachusetts has the best health care in the country, and we need to make sure people can afford it,” Healey said in a statement to CommonWealth Beacon. “It’s why we took action to make sure people can continue to get the vaccines they need no matter what happens in Washington, and that insurance will cover it. We also for the first time limited the cost of health care deductibles and co-pays, including capping prescription drug costs at $25.” 
For those who needed specialists, 32 percent of residents were able to get an appointment within two weeks, 18 percent between three and four weeks, 15 percent said one to two months, and 16 percent said they had to wait more than two months to have an appointment with a specialist. 

The contrast between patient experience and overall satisfaction is a bit of a head-scratcher, notes Parr of the polling group. 
“Massachusetts residents seem to have set a pretty low bar when it comes to rating their health insurance and health care experiences,” he said. Majorities are at least somewhat satisfied with their health insurance, despite a third saying they have skipped or delayed care due to cost in the past year, and nearly as many (28 percent) have had a claim denied by their insurance company in the past year, Parr noted.  
Residents who have skipped care or had a claim denied “do have a less rosy view” of their insurance, he said, but still, most of these residents are at least somewhat satisfied. 
“It may be that Massachusetts’s reputation for health care excellence is driving some of this,” he said. “If residents think they are in one of the top health care states – as most do – perhaps they figure that this is the best service they can expect to get.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Following a viral brawl in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio and federal officials are partnering with local law enforcement to fight violent crime.
Federal agencies including the U.S. Marshalls and U.S. Attorney’s office will step up pursuit of parole violations and firearm prosecutions.
Gov. Mike DeWine said this week during a news conference that highway patrol is helping bolster the Cincinnati Police Department.
“We will be providing, and have been providing, to different cities additional manpower and technology in specific circumstances where local authorities, frankly, could use some help,” DeWine said. “Our troopers, since I became governor, have partnered with law enforcement officers in a number of cities — Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Youngstown, Toledo, and now Cincinnati.”
In addition to helping police patrol hotspots, the patrol will be contributing air support to monitor suspects fleeing the scene of a crime.
DeWine emphasized federal law is “extremely, extremely tough” when it comes to defendants found with a gun illegally — an offense known having a weapon under disability.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Dominick Gerace offered assurances that federal officials “care very deeply about local crime.”
“As governor DeWine mentioned, our federal charges carry stiff penalties,” Gerace said. “And we’ll bring those charges from investigations that occur or start at any level — local, state, or federal — and that includes investigations that come off of operations that result from the partnerships that are being announced today.”
The move to prioritize federal prosecution of gun crimes echoes a similar effort from former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers following a spike in homicides in Columbus five years ago.
In an aside, DeWine added, “I wish in the state of Ohio we had a law similar to that. This is not the day to get into that, but I will just say that I would again call upon our state legislature to enact a law similar to what is at the federal level.”
The governor has indeed urged lawmakers to impose new firearm restrictions — particularly after a mass shooting in Dayton’s Oregon district in 2019.
His appeals fell on deaf ears.
Meanwhile, DeWine has signed several measures loosening Ohio’s gun laws including arming teachers, permitless carry, and stand your ground legislation.

Pointing to the to the city’s crime gun intelligence center, Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said her department has long welcomed collaboration with other agencies.
Since the office launched in 2022, they’ve seen “double digit reductions in shooting victims,” she said.
Theetge described the partnership with state and federal officers as “a force multiplier” to build on what the city is already doing.
“We have more eyes, more hands and more hearts committed to the cause of safety,” she said.
Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval said he welcomed the help. He said the city’s recent crime stats offer “a mixed message.”
According to a violent crime survey from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, in the first quarter of this year, Cincinnati’s incidents of homicide, rape, and aggravated assault were down compared to the prior year. Only robberies saw a modest increase.
But in the latest MCCA survey, which covers violent incidents through the end of June, homicides have shot up, now surpassing the amount in the first half of 2024. Robberies have pulled further ahead as well.
Still, Pureval insisted the city is making progress.
“Street level crimes like theft from cars and burglaries have dramatically dropped with property crimes now down year over year, city wide,” he said. “However, violent crime continues to be a challenge.”
The mayor stated violent crime overall is down, but they’re seeing increases specific areas like downtown and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhoods.
Regardless of the data, though, Pureval said he recognizes people don’t feel safe and that it’s incumbent on local leaders to address that.
“We are still working urgently on public safety,” he said. “While it’s important to be aware of the data, what’s also important is to continue to respond from concerns from the community, and that’s exactly what we continue to do.”

Reporting Highlights

Evidence: The government seeks to deport an Ohio chaplain, but its case has come under scrutiny from supporters and legal advocates.
Support: The U.S. paints the chaplain as a link in terrorist organizations, but in Ohio, families laud his work at a children’s hospital and in the community.
Test Case: If the government secures its quest for deportation, experts say the case could empower the Trump administration’s mass deportation blueprint.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 			



In the weeks leading up to July 9, Ayman Soliman told friends he was terrified of losing the sanctuary he’d found after fleeing Egypt in 2014 and building a new life as a Muslim chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.
Soliman, 51, was to show up at 9 a.m. on that date for his first check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement since losing his asylum status. He’d been granted the protections in 2018 under the first Trump administration. Then, in the last month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke them based on sharply disputed claims of fraud and aid to a terrorist group. Once President Donald Trump returned to office weeks later, court records show, immigration officials bumped up the terrorism claims and formalized the asylum termination June 3.
By the time of Soliman’s ICE appointment, friends said, he was distraught over the prospect of being returned to the regime that had jailed him for documenting protests as a journalist. He arrived at the agency’s field office in Blue Ash, Ohio, accompanied by fellow clergy and a couple of Democratic state lawmakers.
“I didn’t come to America seeking a better life. I was escaping death,” he said in a video filmed just before he entered.
Inside, Soliman’s attorneys said, he was shocked to find FBI agents waiting for him. They interrogated him for three hours about his charity work more than a decade ago in Egypt, the basis for the Department of Homeland Security accusations of illegal aid, or “material support,” to Islamist militants.
His lawyer eventually emerged from the ICE office holding a belt and a wallet. Soliman had been swept into custody, joining a record 61,000 people now in ICE detention. As he awaits an immigration court trial Sept. 25, he is being held in a county jail run by a sheriff who posted a sign outside reading, “Illegal Aliens Here.”
Legal observers are watching the chaplain’s case as a bellwether of the Trump administration’s ability to merge the vast federal powers of immigration and counterterrorism. The case is also a reminder, they say, of sweeping post-9/11 statutes that both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of abusing, especially in cases involving Muslims.
Material support laws ban almost any type of aid to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist groups, extending far beyond the basics of weapons, personnel and money. Prosecutors describe the laws as an invaluable tool against would-be attackers, but civil liberties groups have long complained of overreach.
Over the years, successive administrations have faced legal challenges over how they wield the power; a milestone Supreme Court decision during the Obama administration upheld the laws as constitutional. Now, however, there are particular fears about the material support “sledgehammer,” as one legal scholar put it, in the hands of Trump, who has been openlyhostile toward Muslims and determined to deport a million people who are in the United States without permission.
“These statutes are written extraordinarily broadly with the unstated premise that discretion will be exercised responsibly. And one thing this administration has shown is that it doesn’t understand what it means to exercise discretion responsibly,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who argued high-profile material support cases and served as national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
At issue are DHS allegations that Soliman’s involvement with an Islamic charity provided material support to the Muslim Brotherhood. But neither the charity nor the Brotherhood is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and an Egyptian court found no official ties between the groups.

The Biden-era DHS, which first flagged the issue, said it would revoke Soliman’s asylum if “a preponderance of the evidence supports termination” after a hearing, according to the December notice. At the time, court records show, the material support allegation was listed as a secondary concern after more common asylum questions about the veracity of official documents and his claims of persecution in Egypt.
Once Trump came to power weeks later, Soliman’s attorneys said, the material support claims metastasized, with U.S. authorities declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a Tier III, or undesignated, terrorist group and adding new arguments about ties to Hamas. The Brotherhood, a nearly century-old Islamist political movement, renounced violence in the 1970s, though Hamas and other spinoffs are on the U.S. blacklist. In addition to the Egypt-related concerns, DHS filings about Soliman had noted warrants for “murder and terrorism” in Iraq — a country Soliman says he’s never visited.
By elevating the national security argument, Soliman’s lawyers said, DHS was able to bypass an immigration judge and order the chaplain held without bond as “potentially dangerous.” An established terrorism nexus means less transparency for immigrants — and more power for the authorities.
“DHS is judge, jury and executioner,” said Robert Ratliff, one of Soliman’s attorneys.
The idea of Soliman as a secret militant has outraged residents who know him locally as “the interfaith imam” and the first Muslim on the pastoral care team at Cincinnati Children’s, a top-ranked pediatric hospital. Colleagues described a popular chaplain with nicknames for the tiny patients and soothing words for their bleary-eyed parents.
Judy Ragsdale, the former pastoral care director who hired Soliman in 2021 shortly before retiring, said she wrote a letter to hospital leaders imploring them to speak out against the allegations that could return him to certain persecution in Egypt. He lost authorization to work in June, when his asylum was terminated.
“This is a ‘Schindler’s List’ moment,” Ragsdale said she told hospital leaders. “And if you don’t stand up for Ayman, you’re complicit in what’s happening to him.”
Some fear DHS is parlaying the scope and secrecy of counterterrorism laws into a weapon to boost the president’s mass-deportation mission.
Immigrant rights groups say a sped-up campaign with fewer guardrails for due process is already leading to removals based on evidence that hasn’t been fully vetted. If DHS is successful in test cases like Soliman’s, they say, material support claims could be more easily applied to immigration cases with even tenuous links to militant factions, including newly designated cartels.
The White House referred questions to Homeland Security, which routed a request for comment to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; a spokesperson there said in a statement that the agency generally “does not discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”
“An alien — even with a pending application or lawful status — is not shielded from immigration enforcement action,” the statement said. The FBI declined to comment.
Jeffrey Breinholt, an architect of the material support statutes who spent three decades as a federal terrorism prosecutor, defends the laws as crucial to closing loopholes that were exploited by foreign militant groups and their domestic sympathizers.
Breinholt, who retired in 2024, said he has no concerns about the widening scope as it converges with Trump’s deportation push. The designation of cartels, he said, “is a natural outgrowth of the success we have had with ‘material support’ crime.”
To Cole and other critics, however, the Soliman case could be “the canary in the coal mine.”
 More Than a Chaplain

Within a few hours of Soliman’s detention, dozens showed up for an impromptu rally and news conference in the ICE center parking lot. That backup has since grown into a hundreds-strong campaign to refute the DHS allegations, which supporters call a resurgence of anti-Muslim fearmongering that has persisted across party lines since the 9/11 attacks 24 years ago this month.
“Any time you have a brown man or a Muslim man and you use the words ‘FBI’ and ‘red flag,’ you don’t have to say any more,” said Tala Ali, a friend of Soliman’s who heads the board of a Cincinnati mosque where he sometimes led prayers.
Voices calling for Soliman’s release include parents who met him in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The families are in disbelief that the chaplain they’d grown close to is now jailed in a high-stakes international case. They knew he’d fled Egypt but said they were learning details of his ordeal through the campaign to free him.
“It would be very easy to be resentful and be angry with the world when you have to live through that kind of trauma, and he’s not like that at all. He’s taking on other peoples’ trauma,” said Heather Barrow, whose infant daughter, Mya, died in the NICU last year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She said Soliman stepped in to spare her grieving family the heartache of making funeral arrangements for a 5-month-old. He attended Mya’s celebration of life and, later, a butterfly release on June 7, which would’ve been her first birthday. A month later, he was in an ICE cell.
“I was like, how is this happening? He was just at our house,” Barrow said.
Another couple, Taylor and Bryan McClain, also came to rely on Soliman when their newborn, Violette, arrived at Cincinnati Children’s last year with life-threatening complications. The chaplain steadied them during their 271 days in the NICU, which Taylor said felt like “a roller coaster in a tornado and it’s on fire.” The McClains call him “family.”
“I say with full confidence: Violette is alive because of the advocacy that Ayman gave us,” Taylor said one recent afternoon as she held her daughter, now just over a year old.
Clergy members make up another bloc of support — so many that they built a spreadsheet to divide visiting hours among imams, rabbis and pastors. Immigration advocates and Ohio civil rights leaders have added their names to petitions. So have University of Cincinnati student groups including the Ornithology Club and the Harry Potter Appreciation Club.
More than a dozen people faced criminal charges stemming from a melee after a rally in Soliman’s support; demonstrators and police blame each other for the violence July 17.
Two of Soliman’s fellow chaplains at Cincinnati Children’s, Adam Allen and Elizabeth Diop, said they lost their jobs for refusing to keep quiet about their jailed colleague. Meanwhile, the hospital, a cherished local institution, is taking heat for its silence. Soliman’s supporters launched a letter-writing campaign demanding a response from the hospital, which has said it does not discuss personnel issues.
Signs appeared outside the hospital. “Missing Chaplain,” they said. “Abducted By ICE.”
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital did not return messages seeking comment. In an internal memo published by The Cincinnati Enquirer, hospital CEO Dr. Steve Davis told employees that the lack of response “should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.” As a nonprofit, Davis stressed, the hospital has strict rules about “activities that could be characterized as political.”
Soliman’s supporters press on. One recent Sunday evening, about 200 filled a Cincinnati church where preachers from several faith backgrounds urged them to demand his freedom.
“The trial that Imam Ayman is going through is our trial,” Abdulhakim Mohamed, head of the North American Imams Fellowship, told the crowd. “His justice is ours to own. The injustice is also ours to bear.”
 Escape From Egypt

Soliman’s entanglement with the Egyptian security apparatus began in 2000 when he joined fellow college students to protest repressive laws, he said in asylum papers.
He was periodically locked up and intimidated after that, he said. The persecution worsened more than a decade ago during uprisings that remade the Middle East by toppling dictators — including Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak — but in some places spiraled into civil war.
Soliman worked as a freelance journalist covering pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and neighboring Libya. Friends say he was also studying to become an imam and served on the board of a local chapter of the Islamic charity Al-Gameya al-Shareya, which is known for its network of hospitals and orphan programs throughout Egypt.
The charity, whose name has multiple English spellings, launched in 1912 and is often described as “one of the most established national Islamic organizations.” Scholars have written that early leaders came from the Muslim Brotherhood, archenemy of Egypt’s current military leadership, but that ties ended around 1990 under government pressure.
In the years since, researchers found, the group maintained smooth relations with the government as its more than 1,000 chapters nationwide encompass Egyptians of all political leanings. That delicate balance faltered briefly in 2013 when a military-led counterrevolution quashed the nascent democratic movement and deposed elected leaders who were part of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Egypt’s military rulers declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and shuttered any organization it suspected of ties. Al-Gameya Al-Shareya was among more than 1,000 civil society groups blacklisted in the crackdown, court filings say, and chapters suspected of helping the Brotherhood during elections were dissolved. The group resumed operations the next year, when an Egyptian court lifted the ban, ruling that the charity “has no ties to the Muslim Brotherhood,” according to news reports.

Egypt’s return to zero tolerance for dissidents made Soliman’s activism dangerous, he said in court papers. As a journalist and Islamic scholar, he represented two fields the Egyptian government views as existential threats: a free press and religious organizing.
Soliman fled to the United States in 2014 on a visitor visa and later filed a petition for asylum, describing how security forces over the years had locked him up on false charges and tortured him with electrical shocks. In one incident, his attorney said, Egyptian forces with machine guns stormed into an apartment where Soliman was asleep with his wife and young child. (Through attorneys, Soliman asked to withhold details about his family because they remain in Egypt.)
“For me, it’s life or death,” Soliman later told a U.S. immigration officer of his need to escape.
Officials in Cairo referred questions to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, which did not respond to requests for comment.
The asylum application asked whether Soliman had belonged to political parties or other associations in his home country. Ratliff, the attorney, said Soliman marked “yes” and attached a statement that mentioned Al-Gameya Al-Shareya and his role in fundraising for the local chapter.
Friends said Soliman rejoiced when he was granted asylum in 2018, under the first Trump administration, and sought permanent residency as the next step toward reuniting with his family. But the process stalled. “Bureaucratic hurdle after bureaucratic hurdle,” Ratliff said.
Then came a more serious snag. In 2021, Soliman learned he was on a federal watchlist when a background check for a chaplain job at an Oregon prison showed that the FBI had flagged him, court papers show.
His attorneys said they have no idea why. It could’ve been about a specific piece of intelligence. It could’ve been a misspelling or mistaken identity, simple errors that have landed ordinary Muslims on opaque “war on terror” watchlists that are nearly impossible to get off.
Soliman, friends say, insisted on trying to clear his name. With the help of the Muslim Legal Fund of America, he sued government agencies including the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration. That route led to open-ended legal battles that yielded no clear answers and no green card.
Instead, his place in the country became more vulnerable. In December, the final stretch of the Biden administration, Soliman received notice that the government intended to terminate his asylum based on “inconsistencies” in his claims of persecution and concern that his charity work made him inadmissible based on “possible membership in a terrorist organization.”
Some of his friends are convinced it was payback for the lawsuits, but attorneys say there’s no telling what triggered a review.
“What Ayman has experienced is something that, post-9/11, has been the reality of Muslims in this country,” said Ali, his friend and advocate. “All he did was try to get answers and accountability for what he’d been put through.”
 Big Claims, Little Transparency

Contested asylum cases like Soliman’s were prime targets when Trump took office the next month and supercharged deportations, a top campaign pledge. Since his return to office, ICE arrests have doubled.

Soliman was called to an asylum hearing in February, a month into the new administration, for a last shot at defending his eligibility. A DHS officer asked about claims in the Biden-era notice alleging “discrepancies in date and number of times he suffered harm” and raising doubts about a handwritten Egyptian police report and letters authenticating his journalistic work.
A transcript shows Soliman explaining that he sometimes got confused when describing traumatic incidents from years ago in English, his second language. He said the police report was a rough translation included by mistake and submitted statements verifying his journalism.
Then the DHS officer’s questioning took a turn: “When did you start supporting Al-Jameya Al-Shareya?”
For the rest of the meeting, the transcript shows, the officer drilled down on Soliman’s knowledge of the charity: fundraising, chapter size, support for violence and whether he had been aware of a Brotherhood link.
Another of Soliman’s attorneys interrupted when the immigration officer said the Brotherhood had been a Tier III group since 2012. That’s not how it works, the attorney countered — only top-tier terrorist organizations like al-Qaida or the Islamic State are given dates of designation. Tier III, she said, is for undesignated groups and is determined on a case-by-case basis, with the burden of proof on the government.
“Counsel, I’ll give you an opportunity at the end to make a closing,” the DHS officer said.
“I understand,” the attorney replied, “but we’re talking about something factual.”
The next time Soliman heard from DHS was the official termination of his asylum, effective June 3. This time, there was no hedging in language that declared he was ineligible based on “evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier III terrorist organization.” A few weeks later, he was taken into custody and notified of his pending removal.
Soliman’s legal team sued, arguing that he was stripped of asylum on illegal grounds because the designations had been made “without proper findings” and based on no new evidence.
Court filings show DHS attorneys introducing, then withdrawing or amending, materials to build a case linking Soliman to the Brotherhood through the charity.
“It looked like, ‘What can we put here to get to there?’” said Ratliff, a former immigration judge.
Among the supporting evidence filed by the government are three academic reports by scholars with deep knowledge of Islamic charities in Egypt. Soliman’s legal team filed statements from all three balking at how DHS had cherry-picked their research.
Steven Brooke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison detailed “important mistakes of fact and interpretation.” Neil Russell, an academic in Scotland, called the U.S. conclusions “a mischaracterization of my findings.” Marie Vannetzel, a French scholar who has conducted field research with Al-Gameya Al-Shareya, rebutted what she called “a dishonest manipulation of my text and my work.”
Vannetzel wrote that she rejects the idea that Soliman, “simply by virtue of his activity in the association, could be accused of providing material support to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
Observers of Cairo’s unsparing campaign to uproot Islamist opposition say the matter is clear-cut: If the charity survived the scrutiny of Egyptian intelligence, then it’s not Muslim Brotherhood. “It’s really striking that this group is not proscribed,” said Michael Hanna, an Egypt specialist and U.S. program director of the nonprofit International Crisis Group.
Soliman’s attorneys also criticized the government’s assertion in court filings that he, as a board member of one local branch, would’ve been aware of any Brotherhood affiliation of chapters nationwide. “If a Rotarian in Seattle commits murder, we don’t go charging Rotarians in Des Moines with conspiracy,” Ratliff said.
Separate from U.S. attempts to tie Soliman to the Brotherhood was a puzzling footnote about Iraq that appeared in a later filing. Without detail, DHS attorneys alluded to warrants for “murder and terrorism activities.” Ratliff said a DHS attorney later confirmed to him in a phone call that it wasn’t about Soliman, but didn’t explain why it was there.
The error remained uncorrected in filings until Sept. 3, when DHS attorney Cheryl Gutridge acknowledged in court that it was an “inadvertent” reference to another case, Ohio news outlets reported. The original wording suggesting that Soliman faced murder charges in Iraq had been included in the government’s successful argument for keeping him in custody.
DHS did not address questions about the Iraq reference.
A close friend, Ahmed Elkady, said Soliman told him on a jail visit he was stunned to be linked to Iraq, a place he’s never been: “He said, ‘How can I become a virtual terrorist?”
 A Sheriff’s ICE Fiefdom

As he awaits trial in immigration court, Soliman is in custody at the Butler County Jail, about 30 miles outside of Cincinnati, past cornfields and a German social club and the Town and Country Mobile Home Park.
For more than 20 years, this outpost has been the domain of Sheriff Richard Jones, a cowboy hat-wearing firebrand who keeps a framed photo of Trump in his office. In the run-up to the 2024 election, Jones mused that a Trump victory might put him “back in the deportation business.”
From 2003 to 2021, the jail had been contracted to house immigration detainees until the arrangement dissolved in the Biden era. As predicted, the county entered into a new agreement with ICE in February, after Trump returned to power, to hold around 400 detainees: $68 a day per person, plus $36 an hour for the sheriff’s office toward transportation.
Jones celebrated the restored partnership by posting a fake image showing inflatable gators outside the jail, a nod to ICE’s “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in Florida. A Black Lives Matter group in Dayton issued a statement calling the sheriff’s post an “egregious act of cruelty and historical mockery.”
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

As it returns to deportation work, the jail still faces a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in 2020 by two ICE prisoners who said they endured beatings and discrimination. One plaintiff, a Muslim, said a jailer called him a “fucking terrorist” and threatened to throw his prayer rug in the toilet. Jones has disputed the claims.
The sheriff is in the news again because of Soliman. In court filings, the Muslim chaplain says he was denied access to a space where he could lead communal prayers and then placed in “isolation” for nearly a week with only an hour of phone access between midnight and 1 a.m.
Soliman’s attorneys say in court papers that the episode was related to “targeted harassment” over his religion. The sheriff’s office told local outlets that it respects religious freedom and said Soliman was placed in isolation because he was “argumentative” and “threatening.”
After agreeing to an interview with ProPublica, Jones later decided he was “no longer interested,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Deputy Kim Peters, wrote in a text message.
As he languishes in jail, Soliman’s empty apartment in Cincinnati has become a way station for an inner circle of supporters, who said they felt like “intruders” when they first gathered there. Soliman is known as an elegant dresser, but his apartment was in bachelor-pad disarray, a reflection of his long hours at the hospital and the abruptness of his detention, said his friends, also clerics. The imams laughed when one confessed that he first thought the FBI had ransacked the place.
Over water bottles and energy drinks scavenged from Soliman’s fridge, they talked about the deportation threat. In Egypt, pro-government news outlets already have trumpeted the case as proof that Soliman was leading a secret Brotherhood cell in America.
Despite Soliman’s predicament, they said, being in limbo here is preferable to the alternative.
“You think I’m afraid of being here in jail?” Soliman told fellow imam Ihab Alsaghier during a recent visit. “Every moment I’m alone, I imagine I’m on a flight back to Egypt.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ayman-Clapping-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 04:56:45.436875

(Eric Thomas illustration)Dear Cracker Barrel, 
We need to talk about your redesigned logo. The one you released last month to nationwide groans. The one paired with new interior designs for your restaurants. The one that shoved your stock price into a tumble. The one that sent you scrambling back to your traditional logo less than two weeks later. 
First, let me say this: The only times I’ve eaten at Cracker Barrel was when I lived in a small town.
Twenty-four years ago, our country home, a two-story farmhouse with a tin roof, squatted in the Indiana fields. My wife and I had a firepit where we shared evening beers while birds and bats swooped above our heads, divebombing bugs under a summer sunset. Behind the home was a red barn, and on its side a previous owner wrote “NO PRISON” as a protest against plans for a jail.
We had a new dog and a few acres. And we ate biscuits and gravy at Cracker Barrel. 
If that sounds like the start of a country song, that’s my point.
Your now infamous redesign went wrong by ignoring a quality — let’s call it “country” — that made Cracker Barrel unique.
Because the restaurant is so connected to its country identity, I bet that people would have shrugged if you had renamed the restaurant “Country Barrel.” Instead, the changes to the logo made conservative America gasp and boycott.
Let’s break down your changes to the logo.
Your company, which has five restaurants in Kansas, announced last month that the logo and interior design of its 660 nationwide restaurants would be updated. Because I teach visual design and not interior design, I will stick to your (attempted) logo switch.
For years, your logo featured three main elements. Let’s inspect each one to understand the outrage you absorbed.
On the left side of the logo is a duotone image of a man leaning against a barrel, sitting in a wooden kitchen chair with a woven seat. Clad in overalls, his legs cross as he smiles directly at us. The image mimics prints made from woodcuts, the kind of illustrations printed before mass production of photographs was possible. He is an old-timer shown in an old timey way.
Let’s also note how clumsy that duotone image was. The barrel was illustrated in one style: crisp, linear and simple. The man and the chair? They are illustrated with more nuance and shadowing, reflecting the true textures of real life.
Why am I pointing out this contrast? This is the kind of stuff that drives graphic designers bonkers. I can imagine the in-house graphic design team at corporate headquarters itching to discard this awkward asymmetry: “Let’s ditch grandpa. His illustrated style is so incongruous! So cacophonous!”
On the right side of the logo are the words “Cracker Barrel” held inside a pumpkin-ish shape. So, the logo had a bumpkin and a pumpkin.
The contours of the shape provide room for the upper-case “C” but amputate the letter “B.” (Again, urbane graphic designers wince.) Elsewhere, the stroke of the “k” veers wildly up and to the right. It’s a flourish that mimics handmade country signs before the standardization of typefaces and desktop publishing.
The pumpkin shape that holds the brand name? We can imagine it dangling from two chains on Main Street in a small, southern town. Just like grandpa to the left, the right side of the logo is drenched in country schmaltz.
The final element of the logo was the bottom: the words “OLD COUNTRY STORE.” The typography here is more contemporary through its use of a condensed, all-caps sans serif font. But this is not trendy typography. The logo’s mood remains as safe in its country aesthetic as the center line on a deserted gravel road. 
How did the logo redesign go, Cracker Barrel?
You axed two of the three elements, and the final element was drastically changed. Goodbye to the old-timer and his clip-art barrel, side-lit in the country sunset.
And good bye to “OLD COUNTRY STORE.”
If those changes slapped traditionalists in the face, the changes to the design of the brand name were a gut punch.
In the new brand logo, the color changes migrate from the country and right into the suburbs. The former color of the typography was warm brown, a color connected with rural life. Think agriculture (dirt), manual labor (mahogany stain) and barbecue sauce.
The new typography color is nearly black — if not pure black: sleek, balletic and urban. The color choices drive us a few more miles away from the county fair.
You changed the pumpkin shape to a hexagon with rounded corners. The logo’s typography centers itself inside, with plenty of room to spare. If the shape calls back to anything, perhaps it’s vintage Texaco signs. But what’s the use in that?
The redesign abandoned a central value that customers saw in your restaurants: the country charm of reclaimed wood, down-home cooking and an old timer in overalls. No wonder our country’s polarized, high-octane outrage machine shipped a fresh installment of umbrage to the front door of your corporate headquarters.
In the end, Cracker Barrel, you know the irony of this as well as I do.
There are five restaurant locations in Kansas — none of them in the country. All of them are in the exurbs, squatting at the exits from major highways: Junction City, Olathe, Topeka and two in Wichita. The big wide country of western Kansas has zero Cracker Barrels.
But Denver has one.
Your restaurants are surrounded by convenience stores, big-box retailers and interstate motels. You’re as country as Great Clips, Kohl’s and Mizu Sushi.
So maybe your attempted corporate redesign — a purge of the logo’s rural symbolism — is perfect after all. Maybe you were never as quite as country as any of us imagined.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.)At a recent rally in Hilliard sponsored by the Americans for Prosperity PAC, Ohio Republican governor candidate Vivek Ramaswamy launched into a predictable GOP attack on public education. 
“We are going to bring a radical revolution of standards to our public schools,” he told the gathering.
If you want to go beyond Ramaswamy’s rhetoric, look at a few key words he used, including radical and standards, in his remarks about student outcomes in reading and math. 
Let’s also consider what he didn’t say in the predictable Republican exercise of bashing “failing public schools.”
Contrary to Ramaswamy’s assertion of bringing a radical revolution of standards, in fact it’s the private and religious schools that Ramaswamy and his fellow Republicans favor that mostly lack the kind of common standards that public schools must meet. 
In Ohio, for example, there is no requirement for private and religious schools to take state assessments, the very instruments that provide the reading and math data as well as state report cards that provide ammunition for public education critics. 
Never mind that all Ohio public school students, unlike students enrolled in the 1,300 non-public schools, are required to participate in state testing.
Back to that word radical for a moment. 
Isn’t it extreme to provide $6,166 per pupil for K-8 students and $8,408 for high school students with no required measures in place to assess the performance of the schools receiving taxpayer dollars?

Ramaswamy, a proud entrepreneur, knows quite well that it’s a radical step for any entity, particularly the State of Ohio, to invest $1 billion on a universal voucher initiative and receive no data about the level of performance or impact such spending might have generated.
Now that’s radical, don’t you think?
So think report cards. 
Think reading and math scores for those private and religious schools that accept public money. 
But expect them to also say that it’s socialism to have strings attached as part of having access to the public treasury in the form of education vouchers.
Whether it’s private and religious schools, their proponents have mastered the art of having it both ways: ‘Yes, we believe in and promote school choice. But don’t ever ask us to comply with state assessment standards that can assist the public in having a more comprehensive school report card system. Just send the money.’
And don’t talk about “School Choice” when it’s really about the “School’s Choice” as demonstrated by who is and isn’t admitted and by the “counsel out” process for those students who require more services and instructional support.
But wait, there’s more to consider about Ramaswamy’s remarks that focused on reading and math achievement. 
In these days of rapidly advancing technology and artificial intelligence, what about instruction in science in private and religious schools?
If non-public schools are exempt from so many of the requirements that are mandatory for public schools, do we have assurances that science is even taught in them, particularly those that are affiliated with conservative Christian and other sects?
This statement published several years ago from Americans United for Separation of Church and State gets to the heart of the issue of bad science or no science in some religious schools that are partially supported by the public treasury:

        “There are young people all over America right now learning not just that evolution is weak, but that it’s false. These children are being taught that the Earth, which we know to be five billion years old, is only 6,000 years old. They are being taught that dinosaurs and humans existed at the same time.”

Residents of New York State saw a similar situation a few years back when a group of ultra-religious schools were quick to apply for state funds while ignoring the delivery of a curriculum that would prepare a young person with the necessary tools to be successful – and literate. 
One education expert had this observation:

        “When the state or city says that the yeshivas should provide an education for their students that is ‘substantially equivalent’ to secular education, their leaders cry ‘separation of church and state!’ But, inconsistently, their representatives in the legislature actively lobby for tuition tax credits and vouchers. They want the state’s money but not its oversight of the education they provide.”

Sounds like Ohio, doesn’t it?  
As the debate on no-strings educational vouchers continues, Ohio citizens must be strong in demanding oversight for the expenditure of scarce public dollars that may be going to public and religious schools that lack the transparency needed to ensure that students are prepared for an increasingly complex world.
So, it’s time for the “Science of Reading” to be joined by a new initiative that will ensure that students who receive taxpayer-supported educational vouchers are taught …. science.
Let’s call this new initiative Science in Science, where all citizens are assured that the expenditure of public tax dollars in any school in the state support a proper public purpose and produce an informed citizenry that is literate in science as well as reading and math.

Hoover, chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission, which said Thursday that it will take until at least February 2027 to complete its review of the controversial Piedmont power line. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland regulators will take until at least February 2027 before they can issue a final ruling on the proposed Piedmont power line, according to a schedule set Thursday by the Maryland Public Service Commission.
That schedule is almost a year longer than PSEG Renewable Transmission, the New Jersey-based company planning the line, had hoped for. The company had said that the PSC  would need to issue its decision by the end of March 2026 in order for it to meet a deadline from the region’s electric grid operator to bring the controversial line in-service by June 2027.
The grid operator, PJM Interconnection, has warned that the 67-mile transmission line is among the projects that are necessary in order for it to avoid power failures such as blackouts amid surging demand, thanks in part to the rise of data centers, particularly in Virginia.
But the PSC said in a news release Thursday, in essence, that the grid can wait while it takes the time needed for it to fully evaluate the project.
“In adopting this schedule that includes a longer timeline than PSEG had requested, the Commission has confidence that PJM, the region’s grid operator, will efficiently maintain the grid during the duration of the Commission’s review of PSEG’s application,” read the statement from the five-member Commission, a five-member commission.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

The commissioners also argued that PSEG submitted its application later than expected — on Dec. 31, 2024, rather than in the third quarter of 2024 as originally planned — “leaving less time for the Commission to carry out its review,” the news release said.
At issue is whether or not the commission grants PSEG a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, which would allow them to construct the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project across northern Maryland. In a statement Thursday, the transmission company said that the power line “is a necessary infrastructure project to ensure grid reliability and affordability for Maryland ratepayers.”
“We have received the Public Service Commission’s procedural schedule, and our team is presently conducting a review to determine the appropriate next steps,” wrote William J. Smith, a PSEG spokesperson.
The project, a large transmission line planned to stretch 67 miles through rural parts of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, has attracted considerable opposition from residents, who argue that it will tear through natural lands — all in the name of shipping power through the heart of Maryland to a power station near the Virginia border.
In a statement Thursday, Stop MPRP,  a coalition formed to protest the project, applauded the schedule proposed by the PSC.
“PSEG asked for a rushed timeline that would have forced a decision by early 2026 — before complete studies of farmland, forests, wetlands, and community impacts could even be done,” the statement read. “The PSC rejected that approach.”
The coalition of property owners and other project opponents have also balked at PSEG’s attempts to conduct land surveys for the project, arguing that the surveys represent the company prematurely invoking eminent domain before it has the approval of Maryland regulators.
Federal courts have so far disagreed. A U.S. District Court judge in Baltimore has issued orders allowing PSEG to go onto the property of uncooperative landowoners to complete its surveys on hundreds of properties. Many landowners have appealed the decision in the ongoing case.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the judge’s order, PSEG argued that a handful of landowners were continuing to resist the surveys, and requested back-up from U.S. marshals. But after most of those landowners pledged to allow surveyors onto their property, a judge ruled that the marshals would not be necessary.
The schedule released Thursday calls on PSEG to complete the surveys and submit an updated environmental review for the project by March. Involved parties, including landowners, Maryland’s ratepayer advocate and experts from the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, would file briefs with the PSC by September 2026, followed by two weeks of public hearings in the affected coiunties.
Evidentiary hearings would come in December 2026, and the parties would then submit post-hearing briefs by February 2027. The PSC would make its decision some time after reviewing those briefs, although it isn’t clear how long that could take. The schedule could be amended later for “good cause,” said Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the PSC.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DSC_0305-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 02:56:19.887459

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland legislative leaders were targeted at their homes by bomb threats Thursday, and the U.S. Naval Academy was briefly on lockdown, as tension lingered after the assassination Wednesday of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah.
Both House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) reported receiving bomb threats that were directed at their homes, not their state offices. The threats were deemed credible, officials said, but police ultimately did not find an actual threat.
The only injury reported was at the Naval Academy, where officials said a lockdown was imposed “out of an abundance of caution” after a nonfatal, accidental shooting of a midshipman on campus, which followed threats that had been received at the academy earlier in the day. The campus was put on lockdown shortly before 6 p.m. and remained so into the evening, No other injuries were reported.
Maryland was not alone. Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia were on lockdown Thursday after officials at those campuses received what one called “terroristic threats.”
Democratic legislative leaders in Rhode Island and New Mexico were also the targets of bomb threats, as was the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, which was closed by a bomb threat Thursday, according to news reports.
State lawmakers reconsider cost, purpose of serving after Minnesota assassination

None of the threats were linked directly to the killing of Kirk, who was gunned down during a public appearance before several thousand people Wednesday at Utah Valley University. But in most cases, authorities said the decided to be on the safe side, given the mood of the nation.
Ferguson said that after the killing of Kirk, and the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker in June and attempted killing of another, “it is clear that tragic political violence is on the rise.”
“Earlier today, the Baltimore Police Department received a bomb threat involving our family home. Thankfully, everyone is safe and secure,” said Ferguson, who went on to praise Baltimore City and Maryland State Police in a social media post.
That was echoed by Jones, who said authorities responded quickly to “a bomb threat at my home in Baltimore County … and determined that it was a non-credible bomb threat.”
“While such threats are violating, we can’t let them distract from the important work we do,” she said on social media. “Tonight, I will take time to care for my family and team and look forward to getting back to work tomorrow.”
As they did after the killing of Kirk, state leaders from both sides of the aisle reacted to the threats against Jones and Ferguson with denunciations of political violence and calls for civility in public life.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said on a Facebook post that Jones and Ferguson are “decent, respectful and when they can, consistent with their political beliefs, helpful and accommodating to me and my constituents.” He noted that Jones’ son died unexpectedly earlier this year and that Ferguson has a family with young children
“Calling in bomb threats to their residences or threatening them with violence of any form is despicable and does nothing to advance the conservative cause or better our nation’s future,” he wrote, adding that whoever made the threats should be “investigated, charged and punished significantly.”
Although he disagrees “strenuously” with much of what Democrats advance in Annapolis, Buckel said he would defend them “from violent and unhinged people on either side of the political divide who think that threats and violence are acceptable. Enough.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said on social media that his administration “takes threats like these seriously. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Violence of any type — including rhetoric and threats — will not be tolerated.”
Ferguson said the current violent political climate is “a poison whose inevitable outcome is the destruction of us all.”
“Somehow and someway, the current momentum of our political culture must move away from dehumanizing our ideological opponents and towards a recognition of our shared experiences in this world together,” he wrote. “We can and must be better than this.”

Knowledge could help prevent that, she writes.","There are simple steps that can help prevent a stillbirth, but Angela Moxley didn't learn that until she went through a stillbirth herself (Stock photo by John Fedele/Getty Images)The exam room was dark. In a moment I would replay in my mind hundreds of times, I watched the side of my obstetrician’s face, illuminated by the glow of the ultrasound screen. The nurse had called her in after she couldn’t find my baby’s heartbeat with the Doppler wand.
I had gone into the office first thing that morning because I hadn’t been feeling my baby move. He was due in just over three weeks. Truth be told, I wasn’t overly concerned. The iconic pregnancy book “What to Expect When You’re Expecting” didn’t have much to say about fetal movements. Everything I’d researched said that babies slow down at the end of pregnancy. The night before, my husband asked if he should come. I told him to go to work.
My doctor was upbeat at first, but her face changed. After several minutes of searching the ultrasound screen, she said, “There is no heartbeat.”
In that moment, I couldn’t comprehend what she said. This was my second child — no complications, the nursery was ready at home. Dumbfounded, I asked, “What does that mean?” Still staring at the screen, she softly replied, “I’m afraid it means the baby has died.” Reality shattered. I don’t remember much after, only sitting in the dark waiting for my husband, numb with disbelief, thinking, “I guess this was a stillbirth.”
Before it happened to me, I thought stillbirth was something that had ended back in the 1800s. No one had informed me how common it still is today, with 20,000 babies stillborn each year in the U.S. That’s one out of every 170 pregnancies — 65 stillbirths every single day. And now, my son, Luke, was one of them.

These basic facts about stillbirth opened the door to a hidden world of pregnancy loss, just beneath the myth that everything is safe after 12 weeks. Thrust into a quiet, nationwide community of grieving parents, I began to realize how everything I didn’t know about pregnancy had, in fact, hurt me and my child.
The next morning, I delivered Luke. The obstetrician — not my regular doctor — advised against an autopsy, saying, “Sometimes these things just happen.” But that wasn’t good enough. Luke’s death didn’t make sense, and we needed answers. The autopsy showed Luke was perfect — but his placenta was tiny, shriveled, and filled with blood clots.
We eventually connected with Harvey Kliman, a Yale researcher, who examined slides from Luke’s placenta and informed us that it was in the 0.01 percentile—smaller than 99.99 percent of all placentas. Luke himself was small but not overly so, and his placenta just couldn’t supply his body with enough nutrients and oxygen.
As it turned out, my immune system had attacked the placenta, a condition known as chronic histiocytic intervillositis. In normal pregnancies, Kliman explained, placentas are invisible to the mother’s immune system. No one yet understands why they are not in cases of CHI and similar conditions.
We learned about a tool called estimated placental volume (EPV), developed by Kliman, that helps measure placenta size during ultrasounds and flags when it’s too small — or too large. It’s simple and quick, yet still not widely used for reasons that remain frustratingly unclear. In Luke’s case, EPV almost certainly could have prompted an intervention that would have saved his life.
We also learned how critical it is to monitor fetal movements daily in the third trimester — slowdowns aren’t normal, even near delivery. Tracking can significantly reduce stillbirths, but no one ever emphasized this to me. Luke’s movements had been slowing for weeks, but without proper guidance, I didn’t think much of it.
I’ve heard providers avoid discussing adverse outcomes to avoid stressing mothers. It reminds me of my grandmother, who wasn’t told she was having twins in the 1940s. Over 70 years later, women are still being shielded from truths we deserve to know.
I wish we could reframe the conversation — not as fear, but as power. Parents deserve to know the risks of pregnancy and be trusted to advocate for themselves and their babies. Conditions like preeclampsia, placental disorders and cord compression are real and common. We deserve that knowledge. We deserve agency.
After Luke’s death, I used what I’d learned to protect my next pregnancy. I worked with a specialist to monitor the placenta using EPV and tracked every movement. My second son arrived healthy — but it was the most terrifying experience of my life, filled with constant fear.
No pregnancy should be a nail-biter. No one should have to hear their doctor say, “I’m afraid it means the baby has died.” No one should have to deliver a dead baby in the middle of the night. Women are smart and strong. We have tools to prevent stillbirth. Let us use them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sonogram-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 00:56:26.855314

“It’s clear to me this morning how much we have lost and how far we have fallen, and how hard it’s going to be to find our way back to each other,” said Attorney General William Tong, who lost a friend and classmate when the twin towers fell in lower Manhattan.
The message was not exactly on-brand for Tong, a Democrat who has not shied from opportunities for confrontation with President Donald Trump. He is a political pugilist, a lawyer more than willing to sue. Over everything from immigration to clean energy, Tong vows to make a fight.
“We have to find a way to have policy and political fights,” Tong said, going off topic at a press conference about his demand for documents from the WNBA related to the possible sale and relocation of the Connecticut Sun. “I use that word a lot, I know I do — fight.”
The rhetoric of politics is one of conflict and warfare, if more metaphorical than literal. But a sniper’s killing of Kirk, a charismatic 31-year-old evangelist of conservatism, as he spoke to a college audience of 3,000 in Utah is the latest in a series of attacks on political figures in the U.S.
Trump was the target of two assassination attempts. The residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was firebombed. Nancy Pelosi’s husband was attacked in their home. A state legislative leader in Minnesota and her husband were killed, and another lawmaker and his wife were shot and wounded the same night.
Would Kirk’s death beget more violence?
“We’re sick, we’re sad, we’re angry, and we’re resolute, and we’re going to avenge Charlie’s death in the way Charlie would want it to be avenged,” conservative commentator Jesse Watters said on Fox. He did not explain how Kirk, a religious father of two, would want to be avenged.
On social media and cable, the recriminations over Kirk came fast and from all directions: The rhetoric of the left was at fault, or Kirk deserved his fate after mocking the attack on Pelosi’s husband and arguing that some shooting deaths must to be accepted rather than erode the right to bear arms. There were bipartisan efforts to tamp down such exchanges, nationally and in Connecticut.
“Nine-eleven was 24 years ago, and Charlie Kirk was assassinated less than 24 hours ago. I just want each and every one of us to look out for each other, be particularly kind,” Gov. Ned Lamont said. “There’s a lot of hateful rhetoric in the political marketplace. There’s some pretty tough rhetoric in the social media world, and this seems a pretty good day to be thoughtful, and particularly a time to look out for each other.”

His audience, manufacturers attending a conference at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford, interrupted him with applause.
Which instinct would prevail? 
The young Democratic and Republican groups in Connecticut jointly denounced the murder Wednesday, a gesture that drew attention and praise. Their adult counterparts, Democratic Chair Roberto Alves and Republican Chair Ben Proto, followed suit late Thursday afternoon.
“Now is the time for public officials and advocates to step back and think about how rhetoric impacts and influences the people around us. As leaders of our respective parties and to the leaders of our government, it is imperative that we work together on this issue,” they said in a joint communique. “Violence is unacceptable whether against a Republican or a Democrat or any one of any political belief because we disagree with the opinions they hold.  We bring about change through debate, discussion, and at the ballot box.”
Like Tong and the governor, they noted the date.
“On this day, the anniversary of one of the greatest tragedies our nation has ever suffered, we are reminded that America is at its greatest when we work together,” they said “The task is not an easy one, but America is worth the effort.”
By day’s end, there was another bipartisan call for unity — from the spouses of governors from 30 states and territories. They offered themselves as close witnesses of the contempt heaped on America’s elected leaders, men and women they love.
“The soul of America is corroded every time hateful violence or rhetoric takes root,” the spouses wrote. “Peacemakers are needed in every corner of our society, especially in our politics. Our children are watching. They desperately need us to show them a better way.”
Annie Lamont, the first lady of Connecticut, was among the signers.
Politicians acknowledged, however, a collective crouch, a fear of what might come next. Would angry voices on social media drown out the more temperate pleas for peace and reflection and serve as fuel for more violence in a nation led by a president whose insistence on a stolen election helped inspire an assault on the U.S. Capitol?
Luiz Casanova, the chief of the state Capitol police, emailed legislative leaders and their chiefs of staff Thursday morning urging them to have their members to begin advising his office of any official events away from the Capitol campus.
“This information will allow us to assess potential security needs and coordinate with local authorities, where appropriate, to provide coverage and mitigate risk,” the chief wrote.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the orientation for new lawmakers includes advice on security — and social media. His suggestion on the latter is not to engage or inflame. 
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who aggressively promotes her views on social media, will not swear off positing, but she has grown wary about engaging in on-line debates.
“It’s intense right now,” said Gilchrest, who recently announced a campaign for Congress. “As someone seeking higher office, there is a fear.”
Lamont, a Democrat who is expected to seek a third term next year, talked about a dire need to lower the temperature of American politics. 
There is no thermostat that can make that happen. 
Proto, the GOP state chair, signed the statement with Alves, but he was pessimistic in an interview earlier Thursday about taking down the heat, especially in the pundit class and on social media. 
“Do we need to turn it down? Yeah,” Proto said. “Do we have the ability to turn it down?”
Without mirth, Proto recalled the jokes in the earliest days of Twitter and Facebook about social media one day being the undoing of democracy.
“Well, we’re watching it,” Proto said. “We’re watching it happen.”
Kirk’s death showed signs of resonating more widely and loudly than some other recent acts of political violence. 
The attack was captured on video. He was upbeat and marveled at the size of the crowd, some of whom likely there to accept his invitation to debate his defense of gun rights and all things Trump, a gambit that added to his draw on college campuses. 
“He was doing the right thing when he was murdered,” said state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, who just began a run for governor. “He was using his words to reach out to people who disagree with him in places he was most likely to find them, college campuses.”
Kirk took questions. The last one in Utah was, “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”
His reply: “Counting or not counting gang violence?”
There was a single shot, Kirk fell and his audience fled in confused panic. 
Fazio, more or less a contemporary at 35, said he appreciated the column published in the New York Times by Ezra Klein, a liberal thinker. The headline was, “Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way.”
Causal observers on the left might dismiss Kirk, who began organizing as an 18-year-old college student, as just another right-wing provocateur, loyal to Trump and hostile to liberal causes, transgender rights among them.
“You can dislike much of what Kirk believed and the following statement is still true: Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way,” Klein wrote. “He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him. He was one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion. When the left thought its hold on the hearts and minds of college students was nearly absolute, Kirk showed up again and again to break it.”
Fazio said Kirk was a cultural phenomenon, drawing Gen Z to conservative causes — or inspiring liberal ones to oppose them. Proto agreed, saying, “He clearly was the instigator in getting younger Millennials and Gen Zers engaged in this conversation.”
Rep. Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford, the leader of the Republican minority in the Connecticut House, said, “I was getting phone calls from my kids. This one really struck them.”
Tong offered public condolences.
“I want to say how sorry I am to the family of Charlie Kirk, how sorry I am for the loss of Charlie Kirk, to the people that loved and supported him. We should all be able to say that,” Tong said. “Everyone has a right to be safe.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-7.32.34-PM.png,,,2025-09-11 21:57:13.608705

(Photo provided by ConocoPhillips)A report published by the Alaska Department of Revenue last month says the state treasury will benefit far less from the new Willow oil project than previously estimated.
According to the department’s new estimate, Alaska’s state treasury will net $2.6 billion from the development between 2029, when Willow is expected to begin producing oil, and 2053, the end of its expected productive life.
That’s down 50% from $5.2 billion expected in a 2024 estimate, and from $6.3 billion forecast in a 2023 estimate.
Fairbanks writer Dermot Cole first noted the decline on his website.
Under all three estimates, Willow’s operator, ConocoPhillips, would receive more in state-paid tax credits than it generates the state in tax revenue.
Under Alaska’s current oil tax system, oilfield developers receive tax credits for their lease expenses — the cost of drilling for new oil or producing from an existing field. 
Those credits can be applied against production taxes elsewhere on the North Slope, or on oil from a new well, reducing the amount of money the state receives in taxes.
The new estimate lowers the expected price of oil and increases the cost of production across the North Slope, thus increasing the amount of tax reductions that could be applied to North Slope oil. It also takes into account a slightly different development plan that reduces expected production by 6%.
“Of these changes,” the department wrote in an emailed response to questions, “the increase in slope-wide lease expenditures had the greatest impact on state revenue.”
The department confirmed that the amount of tax reductions exceeds the new projected state revenue from Willow.
“Yes, in our Willow project analysis the total tax credits applied against tax liability over the duration of the analysis do exceed the revenue to the state from the Willow project over the duration of the analysis,” the department said by email. “This is true under both the 2024 and 2025 versions of the analysis. These credits do not represent cash out the door but rather an offset to taxes due based on the volume of oil produced.”
Willow is the largest oil and gas development to date on federal land within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, to the west of Prudhoe Bay. 
That area, believed to be home to significant oil reserves, is almost entirely untapped, and some state officials have said they believe that revenue from NPR-A would be particularly important as the state tries to bring expenses and revenue in line over future years.
The new estimate diminishes that hope. It predicts that peak production in 2030, Willow will be generating less than $300 million per year for the state treasury.
The state of Alaska isn’t the project’s only fiscal beneficiary. Under federal and state laws, 16.67% of production is paid in royalties to the federal government, with half of that money being redirected to the state, which uses it for grants to North Slope Borough communities.
This year, $31 million was split across four communities and the North Slope Borough.
Over the next 27 years, the state estimates those communities and the borough will share $3.1 billion. The borough itself will receive $1.2 billion from local property taxes. The federal government would receive $5.8 billion.
ConocoPhillips, the producer, would receive $10.3 billion, the state estimates. That’s up from $9.8 billion in the 2024 estimate and $9.9 billion in the 2023 one.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan joined fellow Senate Republicans Wednesday night in voting to set aside a budget amendment that would have compelled the U.S. Department of Justice to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The vote to table the amendment, stopping the Senate from considering it, was 51-49. 
All of the Senate’s Democrats voted in favor of the amendment, as did Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rand Paul of Kentucky.
The failure of either of Alaska’s Republican senators to vote for the amendment drew criticism from the Alaska Democratic Party.

Murkowski, talking by phone on Thursday, said the amendment, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, came as a surprise, and she voted against it for procedural reasons, not because she opposes the idea of a release.
“What Schumer did was nothing more than a political stunt,” Murkowski said.
In July, Murkowski and other members of a Senate budget subcommittee voted unanimously to amend a proposed appropriations bill to mandate that the U.S. Department of Justice compile a report on the activities of Epstein, a sex trafficker with extensive ties to rich and powerful people worldwide. Epstein died in jail while awaiting trial in 2019. 
The final text of the bill requires a report, but not the release of original documents in the possession of the federal government.
President Donald Trump campaigned on releasing the documents during last year’s presidential election, but this summer has since broken that campaign pledge, downplaying the case 
In February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she had Epstein’s client list “sitting on my desk right now.” But in July the FBI announced in a memo that there was no “client list” and no more public information would be released. The announcement caused a public outcry, and the federal government still has not released the documents.
Trump’s social relationship with Epstein was well-documented, and this week, the Wall Street Journal published a copy of a birthday greeting Trump sent to Epstein in 2003. Trump has claimed the letter doesn’t exist, but it bears his signature.
The letter was released to the public after being obtained by U.S. House members investigating the Epstein case.
“I have been — I don’t know if it’s fair to say one of the rare Republicans — certainly a very early Republican on the Senate side who said, ‘Look, just, just release these Epstein files. Just get this stuff out there,” Murkowski said.
The appropriations bill with Murkowski’s preferred Epstein language would fund the U.S. Department of Justice and other commerce and science-related parts of the federal government. For that reason, it’s been nicknamed the “CJS bill.”
It has not yet come to a floor vote, and with senators hurrying to pass budget bills before the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, it isn’t clear when it will come up.
“Will we see the CJS as part of a floor package that could move through the Senate? It’s not impossible, but we are kind of running out of daylight,” Murkowski said.
Part of that uncertainty is due to Senate Democrats’ opposition to the overall contents of the bill. That opposition has slowed the bill’s progress.
Schumer’s amendment would have forced the Senate to debate the Epstein issue immediately, as part of the annual defense authorization bill now under debate.
In response to a request for comment, Sullivan’s office issued a written statement that also criticized Schumer’s amendment and defended his vote.
It said in part, “Senator Sullivan has repeatedly said that he believes the DOJ should release as much information as possible on Epstein’s horrific crimes, while protecting survivors. Chuck Schumer tried slipping the Epstein provision into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), knowing full well it would be stripped out as the bill went through the process, leaving no doubt he’s using Epstein’s atrocious crimes as a political pawn instead of focusing on building up our military in the NDAA, which Schumer has never shown any interest in doing.”
Murkowski said the amendment disrupted normal work on the defense bill and “threw a real wrench into the whole negotiated process that had really been moving along in a positive way.”
She said she believes Schumer brought up the Epstein issue because Senate Republicans are preparing to change the rules for the confirmation of Trump’s executive-branch nominations.
Ordinarily, the Senate approves uncontroversial nominees without a roll-call vote to make the process more efficient. Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, none of his nominees have been approved without a roll-call vote, an unprecedented change in the Senate, and one that has slowed both the Senate and the Trump administration’s confirmations.
In response, Senate Republicans are planning to change the Senate’s rules to allow the approval of multiple nominees with a single vote.
“I think he was trying to kind of change the narrative,” Murkowski said of Schumer’s proposed amendment. “I don’t think he was making much headway on his pushback on some of the nominations. And he made a decision that, I think, is going to be short-lived in its political fire. He really kind of poisoned the waters around here in terms of good-faith negotiations.”
The day after the vote, Alaska Democratic Party Chair Eric Croft released a statement, saying by email: “Just two months ago, Dan Sullivan called on the Department of Justice to release the documents to shine a light on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific crimes. But last night, Dan Sullivan was a deciding vote to continue the cover-up and block an effort to force the DOJ to release the Epstein files. Instead of listening to Alaskans and the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, Sullivan acted in his usual fashion – like a spineless politician who’s only loyal to his billionaire buddies. Alaskans and survivors deserve better.”
Sullivan faces re-election in 2026 and is running for another term in Congress.
To date, no Democrat has filed with the Alaska Division of Elections to challenge Sullivan. Filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Republican Christopher Miklos of Homer and Democrat Ann Diener of Fairbanks have filed forms necessary to begin fundraising.
The U.S. House, meanwhile, is close to having enough support to force a vote on the Epstein issue. While Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, opposes bringing up the topic, a bipartisan petition could override the Speaker if it has 218 signatures. As of Wednesday night, it had 217. Alaska’s lone member of the House of Representatives, Rep. Nick Begich, has not signed the discharge petition. His office did not respond to questions about his position on the Epstein issue and whether he will sign the petition.

Gilchrist is a resident of Detroit. He said in a statement issued via email and on social media that the threat has been cleared. He thanked law enforcement for their quick response, and for “keeping my family and our neighborhood safe.”
The incident occurred a day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at a university event in Utah.
“I know that people are on edge – it’s a scary time … in the midst of an escalating pattern of political violence in Michigan and in America,” Gilchrist said. “The purpose of this violence is to silence, intimidate, and eliminate people and their voices from our society. That won’t work on me. We cannot let this remain our reality.”

A message seeking comment and further details of the incident from the Michigan Department of State Police was not returned at the time of publication.
A spokesperson for the city of Detroit said that State Police were handling media inquires regarding the incident when asked if the city’s police and fire departments responded to Gilchrist’s home on Thursday.

Gilchrist, who is also a candidate for governor in 2026, added that the nation and Michigan “cannot tolerate political violence.” 
“We cannot excuse it. We cannot normalize it,” he said. “We have to push through this and do the work to do better. It’s not easy, but nothing important ever is. It’s up to us to dig deep and commit to ending violence and creating a safe, healthy society.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also commented on the incident on social media.
“I’m grateful that Lt. Governor Gilchrist and his family are safe after the bomb threat at his home today,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Let me be clear – political violence is unacceptable and has no place in Michigan. As Michiganders, we must reject all political violence and work towards a safer future.”
Reports of bomb threats were documented around the nation on Thursday, including against New Mexico’s Democratic Senate and House leaders, and numerous historically Black colleges and university campuses. Rhode Island State Police also said they were investigating bomb threats against top Senate Democrats on Thursday afternoon, however, the law enforcement agency said the emailed threats appeared to be hoaxes.

By Ryan Colasanti, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE Sports
MIDDLETOWN, Del. — After a grueling start against nationally respected opponents, the Middletown Cavaliers will once again defend Delaware’s football reputation when they host Our Lady of Good Counsel (Md.) this Friday at 7 p.m.
Delaware teams are a combined 5–6 against out-of-state competition this season, and Middletown accounts for two of those six defeats. Both losses came on the road—narrow setbacks against Ohio’s Bishop Watterson and New Jersey’s Red Bank Catholic by a combined margin of just six points. The Cavaliers’ defense shined in both contests, holding each opponent to just two touchdowns, but the offense fell just short in the closing minutes.
Middletown isn’t the only team carrying the state banner in these regional matchups. Last week, Salesianum hosted Pennsylvania powerhouse La Salle College High School in a hard-fought non-conference game on September 5 in Wilmington. The game was tied 14–14 at halftime, and Salesianum briefly grabbed a third-quarter lead with a 30-yard field goal to make it 17–14. But La Salle answered with two fourth-quarter touchdowns to pull away, sealing a 28–17 victory before a crowd of more than 1,000 fans. Strong defensive stands and strategic punting highlighted a contest that showed Delaware’s top programs are willing to test themselves against elite out-of-state foes.
Now Middletown returns home for its third and final out-of-state matchup of the year, looking to turn near-misses into a statement victory. The challenge will be steep. Good Counsel, a perennial power from the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference, arrives undefeated at 2–0 after impressive wins over opponents from Florida and New Jersey. The Falcons reached last year’s WCAC championship game, defeating Gonzaga High School in the semifinals before falling to DeMatha.
Friday’s showdown offers Middletown a chance to reclaim momentum and give Delaware a signature win against a national-caliber program. With a stingy defense and home-field advantage, the Cavaliers will look to show they can finish what they’ve started in tight games against elite competition.
Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Middletown High School.  Delaware LIVE will have a report on the game on Saturday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/e3910720-3486-45ce-96d5-37fa255d28a9.png,,,2025-09-11 20:56:37.467907

This […[...]","The possibility of removing four Snake River dams — Ice Harbor Dam, Lower Monumental Dam, Little Goose Dam and Lower Granite Dam — has long been a contentious one that has generally split along party lines. Shown is the Ice Harbor Lock and Dam, the first of four dams constructed as part of the Lower Snake River Project, authorized in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945. (Photo by Columbia River System Operations EIS)Northwest states, tribes and environmental groups will resume suing the federal government over its hydroelectric dam operations in the Columbia River Basin that have harmed endangered native fish species. 
The move comes after the Trump administration in June withdrew from a “historic” deal made two years ago, when President Joe Biden was in office. This agreement called for putting long-running legal battles aside and investing in the restoration of endangered Columbia River fish runs. 
Behind the litigation are 10 environmental groups backed by Oregon, Washington and four Lower Columbia River tribes: The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the Nez Perce Tribe. 
Court fights over the dams had gone on for more than three decades before the pause. Now, they are back on, according to Amanda Goodin, an attorney with the environmental law group Earthjustice, which filed a motion Thursday in U.S. District Court in Oregon to end the multi-year pause on a 2021 lawsuit. 
“The Trump administration’s recent actions leave us with no choice but to return to court,” she said. 
On Oct. 8, Earthjustice will officially resume its lawsuit, spokesperson Elizabeth Manning said. 
Earthjustice’s plaintiffs include the National Wildlife Federation, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, Institute for Fisheries Resources, Sierra Club, Idaho Rivers United, Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association, NW Energy Coalition, Columbia Riverkeeper, Idaho Conservation League and Fly Fishers International, Inc.   
Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a statement that Oregon, too, was ready to resume legal action. 
“The federal government has put salmon and steelhead on the brink of extinction and once again broken promises to tribal partners. Extinction is not an option. Oregon will return to court to hold the federal government accountable and ensure these iconic fish runs have a future,” he said.
White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday. 
The 2023 Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement involved pausing active Snake River litigation for a minimum of five years while the federal government worked with tribes and states on a plan to advance recovery of native fish populations in the Columbia Basin. 
At the heart of the issue are four Snake River dams that provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. 
The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orcas off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
“These wild native fish are essential to tribal cultures and important to sport, commercial, and tribal fishing communities and economies throughout the Pacific Northwest.  We can and must do better,” said Bill Arthur, the director of the Sierra Club’s campaign to protect salmon in the Snake and Columbia rivers. 
The Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative included a roadmap for salmon and steelhead recovery, as well as steps to replace the energy, transportation, irrigation, and recreation services provided by the four lower Snake River dams so they could potentially be breached. 
The agreement was a way to increase salmon populations and fishing opportunities while improving public services, cutting taxpayer subsidies and meeting promises made to the tribes, according to Mike Leahy, senior director of wildlife, hunting and fishing policy for the National Wildlife Federation. 
In June, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum withdrawing the federal government’s support from the agreement, calling it “radical environmentalism” and saying completion of the restoration initiative would “be devastating for the region.” 
“It’s been disappointing to see the federal government overrule all the progress made in the region in favor of returning to court,” Leahy said. 
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement that renewing the lawsuit is necessary to protect natural resources, preserve fish runs, and hold the federal government responsible.
“President Trump walking away from these commitments presents a very real threat at a time when the fish are on the brink of extinction. It also continues our nation’s shameful legacy of broken promises to sovereign tribal nations that this partnership sought to repair,” she said.
While environmental groups agree that going back to court is an essential next step, they have committed to finding other ways to continue restoring the Columbia Basin while the lawsuits are ongoing. 
“We will nevertheless keep working with sovereigns and stakeholders across the Northwest to find real solutions to restore healthy, abundant salmon and bring our communities forward together,” said Columbia Riverkeeper Legal Director Miles Johnson.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iceharbor-dam-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 20:56:37.467907

(Screenshot from Arkansas PBS YouTube channel)Homeschooled children account for nearly 40% of those approved to participate in Arkansas’ Educational Freedom Account program this school year, according to figures presented to the State Board of Education Thursday.
Darrell Smith, assistant commissioner in the Office of School Choice and Parent Empowerment, told board members 18,420 of the 46,634 students approved for EFA participation this fall are homeschooled. The school choice office is part of the state Education Department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Arkansas’ public school student population by comparison is 474,337, according to the ADE Data Center.
Smith said the number of homeschooled students in the voucher program represents about 50% of the estimated homeschooled student population.
The Educational Freedom Account program has provided state money for allowable education expenses since its creation under the LEARNS Act in 2023. The program has been phased in over three years with increasing eligibility and is open to all students for the first time this fall. Private school tuition is one of the allowable education expenses for students who receive the roughly $7,000 each the state will provide in the 2025-26 school year.
Since the state funds go to the student’s family, students in microschools also are eligible. Smith said 100 microschools are registered with the education department. Arkansas defines a microschool as “a tuition-based organization that serves a community of homeschool students, simultaneously in the same space, and that maintains responsibility for employing instructors or facilitators to provide part-time or full-time academic services.”
Smith told the state education board that 162 private schools and 28,214 private school students are approved EFA participants this academic year.
Asked how his office assures that schools don’t gouge parents with hefty tuition increases because of the state funding, Smith said his staff requires schools to provide a history of tuition increases and makes sure the schools have “a legitimate, rational reason” for any increases. His office also analyzes each school’s cost of educating a child to determine if any increases are in line with additional costs.
“We’re not just taking them at their word,” Smith said.
Under EFA program rules, the Department of Education may prohibit schools from participating in the program if the department determines tuition or fee increases “are unreasonable or arbitrary.”
Smith said the department doesn’t give schools an upper limit or maximum percentage by which tuition can increase, adding that the policy is “one way we can hold private schools accountable.”
During his report on EFA participation, Smith said 17% of this year’s approved students are those with disabilities. Students with disabilities were among the first eligible when the program started in the 2023-2024 school year.
Another 17% of voucher recipients this year are children of veterans and first responders, he said. Children of law enforcement officers and active duty military each account for 2% of participants. 
Another 2% are students from public schools with “D” or “F” grades, according to a chart Smith presented. Students in foster care represent 4% of voucher recipients, and roughly 0.3% are homeless, the chart showed.

The change comes as the Trump administration continues pushing for increased resource utilization of public lands, including through logging and mining.[...]","A Bureau of Land Management office in Billings, Montana. The office also includes the Billings Office of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montana)The federal government on Wednesday proposed rescinding a Bureau of Land Management rule that allows the department to consider conservation as part of its multi-pronged approach to federal land management.
The change comes as the Trump administration continues pushing for increased resource utilization of public lands, including through logging and mining.
The proposal drew immediate reactions from Montanans — with political leaders praising the reversal as helpful to energy production but conservation groups decrying it as another harm to public lands access.
“President Trump and Secretary Burgum are bringing back commonsense land management policies that will benefit Montana farmers, ranchers, and producers,” Montana U.S. Sen Steve Daines said. “The harmful Public Lands Rule would have blocked access to use of public lands for outdoor recreation and also would have restricted energy production, grazing, and forest management. By rescinding the Public Lands Rule and unlocking more timber sales in Montana, we’ll be better able to manage our forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires. President Trump is committed to Treasure State priorities and this is welcome news.”
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a department press release that the “Public Lands Rule” exceeded BLM’s authority and placed an “outsized priority” on conservation use of federal land, threatening energy development, grazing and recreation use.
“The previous administration’s Public Lands Rule had the potential to block access to hundreds of thousands of acres of multiple-use land – preventing energy and mineral production, timber management, grazing and recreation across the West,” Burgum said. “The most effective caretakers of our federal lands are those whose livelihoods rely on its well-being. Overturning this rule protects our American way of life and gives our communities a voice in the land that they depend on.”
The Biden-era rule, formally the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, went into effect in spring of 2024, as a way to better define how the BLM approaches land management decisions. According to the final decision in the federal register, the rule helped clarify the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, by letting the department protect “intact, functioning landscapes;” offer restoration and mitigation leases, alongside grazing and extraction leases, to restore degraded habitats and ecosystems; and emphasize landscape health in decision making by utilizing science and data, including Indigenous Knowledge.
“The rule does not prioritize conservation above other multiple uses. It also does not preclude other uses where conservation use is occurring. Many uses are compatible with different types of conservation use, such as sustainable recreation, grazing, and habitat management. The rule also does not enable conservation use to occur in places where an existing, authorized, and incompatible use is occurring,” the final rule states.
The rule drew the ire of industry groups and politicians across the west, including Burgum, then-Gov. of North Dakota, and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who along with the state of Idaho sued the federal government over the conservation rule. The BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land across Montana and the two Dakotas.
Conservation and recreation organizations, along with an overwhelming majority of the public that weighed in on the rule, supported allowing conservation and restoration to be considered more actively by federal land management agencies. According to an analysis by the Center for Western Priorities, 92% of more than 150,000 public comments supported the rule.
Outdoor-oriented policy and advocacy groups, including the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and the National Parks Conservation Association released statements opposing the change en masse on Wednesday.
“Every one of this administration’s public-lands policies is designed to sell out public access, recreation, clean water, and wildlife to boost corporate profits. ‘Multiple-use’ doesn’t mean that oil and gas corporations get to dictate what happens to our public lands,” said Aubrey Bertraim, federal policy director of Wild Montana. “Rolling back the Public Lands Rule is another way to cut out public input, undermine local management, and give industry and billionaires control of the places where we hike, hunt, fish, camp, and ride. Who cares if that hurts regular Montanans? It’s time to call this what it is: The latest move in a systematic approach to dismantle the public lands that support our way of life.”
The Outdoor Industry Association in a press release said the change would hurt economies and businesses that rely heavily on the outdoor recreation industry.
“America’s public lands are the engine of the $1.2 trillion outdoor economy and should be protected so future generations can continue hiking, climbing, and recreating in our most cherished places,” Outdoor Industry Association president Kent Ebersole said. “The rescission of the public lands rule would not only prevent accessible outdoor recreation on these vital lands but also hurt the small businesses and gateway communities that rely on it. The outdoor industry urges the administration to reconsider this decision and protect the landscapes that are vital to local economies, small businesses, and the outdoor recreation community.”
Many opponents of the Public Lands Rule claim it excluded grazing, extraction and recreation in favor of conservation, but the rule specifically states that it “does not prioritize conservation” above other uses, but puts them on equal footing in decision making. The text of the rule describes how conservation is an essential piece of the planning and management process. As an example, the rule states that a restoration lease could be paired with a grazing lease to allow tracts of public land to recover between periods of grazing.
But the Interior Department said rolling back the rule will also offer a more stable future for extraction and energy industry stakeholders concerned about litigation or permitting delays that could be brought forth under the rule.
“The rescission of the Public Lands Rule will eliminate unnecessary barriers to energy development and support the multiple-use mandate of the BLM by not prioritizing conservation over all other uses,” according to the Interior Department.
Rich Nolan, President and CEO of the National Mining Association, praised the move, saying the Biden had “unlawfully placed conservation above all else.
A screenshot of the BLM’s website on Sept. 11, 2025.
“This new rule reinstates the balance of federal land use intended by Congress, ensuring that our vast resources can meet today’s soaring energy needs and become the secure mineral supply chains for American industry,” Nolan said in a statement.
According to the BLM website, the policy on restoration and mitigation leasing has already been declared inactive as of Feb 27 of this year, following one of Trump’s executive orders from early in his term.

He discussed his “50 by 50” generation plan to increase West Virginia’s energy capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050 – an increase from the 15 gigawatts it currently produces. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey unveiled a new comprehensive energy plan for West Virginia on Wednesday, which will largely rely on doubling down on and increasing power generated from the state’s nonrenewable energy sources like coal and natural gas.
The plan — dubbed the “50 by 50” generation plan by Morrisey — aims to see the state increase its power capacity from the current 15 gigawatt generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050. Morrisey said increased generation is necessary so the PJM — the massive power grid network that West Virginia feeds into — can meet estimated future demands.
Morrisey noted that, by 2045, it’s estimated that there will be a 70 gigawatt increase in peak load demand from the PJM, which serves West Virginia along with 12 other states. Meanwhile, he said, it’s projected that about 40 GW of the PJM’s generating capacity may be retired by 2030.
“Within the next 20 years PJM will likely need 110 GW of new generation capacity just to keep pace with demand growth and aging retirements. Currently, very few states within PJM can produce enough power to meet their own needs, much less export power to other states. West Virginia is one of those states,” Morrisey said. “[W]hile West Virginia is a national leader in per-capita electricity exports, we lack the existing generation capacity to meet future needs.”
To reach his goal of 50 gigawatt generating capacity, Morrisey said the state will prioritize growing its “stable baseload generation over renewables” through continued reliance on coal and natural gas as well as nuclear energy. 
“Baseload generation from coal, natural gas and nuclear are critical to our way of life,” Morrisey said. “It provides a stable backbone to the grid, ensuring there is always a dependable supply of electricity.”
West Virginia currently has no nuclear energy developments operating. In 2022, however, lawmakers passed a bill repealing the state’s previous ban on nuclear energy, paving the way for future generation. 
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, West Virginia has five “multiple unit small modular reaction plants” that are scheduled to be in operation by 2025. Appalachian Power, the state’s largest electric company, is currently in the process of creating a small modular reactor in Virginia.
Morrisey said that he not only wants to keep the state’s current coal plants operational, but he also plans to explore options for newly created coal-generated power plants.
“West Virginia has numerous coal plants that have powered this country for decades. We need these plants to remain operational,” Morrisey said. “… We will never turn our backs on our existing coal plants and we will work with the federal government to pursue new coal-fired generation.”
Most of the state’s existing coal plants were commissioned decades ago and upgraded since then to remain operational. No new large coal-fired power plants have been commissioned in West Virginia or elsewhere in the United States in over 10 years.
Morrisey said West Virginia’s coal industry has been a “cornerstone of electricity generation” and has helped ensure “affordable and reliable power” in the state.
According to a 2022 review of electric utilities across the country, West Virginians paid the third highest total household electricity costs as a percentage of their income. Alabama and Mississippi, according to the study from the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, were the only states where prices outpaced that of the Mountain State.
National security and the race for artificial intelligence, data center developments
Morrisey’s remarks heavily focused on threats facing the U.S. from China, Russia and elsewhere. Namely, he said that “energy is being used by our adversaries to threaten the American way of life.”
“China, Russia and Iran are three of the largest energy producing countries in the world and three of our nation’s biggest adversaries,” Morrisey said. “They are coordinating diplomatically, militarily, and economically to weaken American influence and build an alternative global order.“
Specifically, Morrisey said, the country needs to ensure it is competing with and protecting itself from China, which is a massive coal-fired power generator and “dominates” mineral supply chains.
“China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of critical data to China instead of to the United States,” Morrisey said. “America can either find a way to dramatically increase its power production, or China will eclipse our nation in a technological battle that will undermine our national security.”
Data centers, Morrisey continued, are central to this “battle.” He said the state has partnered with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to assist with “crafting our data center development strategy.”
But several data centers are already proposed to be developed in West Virginia. Permits for some have already been approved. Several of these data centers will be powered by “microgrids,” which operate separate from existing utilities. This was made possible during the 2025 legislative session, where lawmakers passed House Bill 2014 allowing these microgrids to be established.
That legislation also included language to stop localities from enforcing zoning laws and other ordinances — like ones for noise and light pollution — against the developments.
From Tucker County to the state’s Southern Coalfields, residents have started organizing in an attempt to stop these developments. They’re worried about how they will impact their communities through unhealthy emissions and massive water consumption, which they fear will threaten their own water supplies.
Morrisey said Wednesday that the state needs to “ensure” that the “rapid innovation and demand” from data centers does not “negatively impact” residents. He did not outline what those negative impacts would be or how they would be avoided. 
Environmental advocates decry lack of renewable energy in state strategy
While Morrisey said that every kind of energy needs to be embraced in order to meet electricity demand, he said the place for renewable energy — like solar and wind — is limited.
He cited the state’s lack of “flat land” and a study showing that West Virginia, on average, does not have a high number of “annual sunlight hours.”
Solar power, generally, does not need year-round sunlight to create power. When electricity is generated from solar, it can be stored in batteries for use on overcast days and at night.
Shawn Phillips, with the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, said it was insulting to hear Morrisey call West Virginia’s energy “affordable” and coal “common sense” since power bills in the state continue to climb. Meanwhile, largely under Republican leadership, West Virginia has refused to invest in or grow its renewable energy sector.
Just this year, lawmakers proposed legislation to prohibit all wind power projects, establish new taxes for electricity from wind and solar projects, limit the number of wind projects allowed in a year, eliminate all subsidies for renewable energy projects, and increase taxes on wind turbines.
Current policies ban community solar, which allow residents and businesses to join a nearby solar project and lower their electricity prices from utilities. Bills to repeal this ban have repeatedly failed at the Legislature.
Phillips said that if West Virginia wants to make energy affordable and reliable, the state needs to explore its options with renewable energy forms.
“Coal is an unreliable fuel — it’s aging, breaking down, and driving prices up,” Phillips said. “Renewables are the fastest, cheapest, and most dependable sources we can build today. Fossil fuels don’t just drain wallets — they poison our air and water. Propping them up means West Virginians pay twice: once on their bills, and again with their health.”
Jillian Welsh, communications coordinator for the state Environmental Council, echoed Phillips’ points. If energy affordability is the goal, Welsh said, then “renewables have to be front and center.”
“Wind, solar and [battery] storage are the fastest, cheapest resources to build, and leaving them out makes [Morrisey’s] plan obsolete on day one,” Welsh said. “Chasing ‘50 by 50’ by tripling coal, gas and nuclear is a recipe for higher bills and dirtier air — not progress.”
Welsh noted that Morrisey did not once mention the growing impacts of climate change in the region or any move to cut carbon emissions, which can threaten residents’ health and contribute to climate change.
West Virginia is already home to the ninth highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the nation, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. As a whole, the state was the 12th highest emitter nationally for greenhouse gases in 2023.
Currently proposed natural gas power plants would contribute more emissions into the atmosphere. In Mingo County, two proposed methane-powered plants would become the state’s third and fourth largest power plants once built, behind only the John E. Amos plant and the Harrison Power Station. Those power plants, if approved, are planned to power two data centers and an ammonium plant. 
As they would operate as microgrids, local governments would have no say or power over their operations.
“Communities get no say over whether they want massive new plants in their backyards. There’s barely a nod [in Morrisey’s address] to protecting air, water and health — and not a word on mountaintop removal,” Welsh said. “And while the governor warns about China, he ignores the fact that China is leading a solar revolution that’s making energy cheaper. At the same time, West Virginians are being told to foot the bill for outdated, polluting power.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington state Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu will retire from the bench at the end of this year.
Yu, appointed in 2014, told fellow justices Thursday afternoon after informing Gov. Bob Ferguson in a letter last week. 
Ferguson will appoint a new justice, his first appointment to the state Supreme Court. An election will be held next year to complete the remainder of Yu’s term, which runs through Dec. 31, 2028.
“It is not an easy decision to step away,” she wrote in the letter. “I have had the good fortune of serving the people of our great state as a judge for 25 years and have cherished every single moment of such service.”
Washington Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu announced Thursday she will retire at the end of the year. (Photo courtesy of the Administrative Office of the Courts)
Yu highlighted the time she’s spent “mentoring and teaching those younger than me to embrace life, lead, and to make a difference.”
“They cherish the rule of law, and they will defend and protect the courts that I love so deeply,” she said.
Chief Justice Debra Stephens called Yu “a dynamic leader,” praising her work as a mentor of new lawyers and a champion of racial justice through her leadership on the Washington State Minority and Justice Commission.
“She has served the people of Washington with passion, intellect and boundless energy,” Stephens said in a statement.
Ferguson said in a statement that during her time on the bench, Yu has demonstrated her commitment to respect, dignity and fairness for all.” 
“Her legacy is in bending Washington state further toward justice,” he said.
Trailblazing career
Yu was raised in Bridgeport, a South Side neighborhood in Chicago, by immigrant parents. Her mother came from Mexico and her father from China. She is the first in her family to graduate from college, according to her official biography.
When Gov. Jay Inslee appointed her to the state Supreme Court on May 16, 2014, Yu became the first Asian, the first Latina and the first member of the LGBTQ community to serve on the court. She went on to win elections in 2014, 2016 and 2022.
Before reaching the state’s high court, the trailblazing Yu had etched her place into state history.
At midnight on Dec. 9, 2012, when same-sex couples could begin to legally marry in Washington state, several lined up outside a Seattle courtroom to have Yu, then a King County Superior Court judge, preside over their nuptials.
Sarah and Emily Cofer of Snohomish County were first up.
“Judge Yu was warm and welcoming. She presided over the ceremony with comfort and joy that made it feel like a personal event even in such a public setting,” Sarah Cofer recounted in a biography of Yu in the “Love, Equally” exhibit marking the history of marriage equality in Washington.
Yu worked more than 14 years as a trial court judge in King County Superior Court after serving as deputy chief of staff to former King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.
In her letter to Ferguson, Yu said personal events over the past year “have shed a new light on how I might want to spend the next 25 years of my life.”
Yu, in a phone interview Thursday, said two events catalyzed her decision. Last year, an early detection of breast cancer led to two surgeries and she is now “completely healthy.” Then, in March, Justice Susan Owens passed away at age 75, just three months after retiring from the bench.
“I thought, life just can’t end this way for me. I want to travel. I want to teach. I want to write,” she said. “Life is a precious gift.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/washington-state-temple-of-justice-supreme-court--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 19:57:57.363547

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)HOPE — Hempstead County health care providers and law enforcement officers told Arkansas lawmakers Thursday they need more money in order to meet Southwest Arkansas’ mental and physical health care needs.
Pafford Health Systems, a locally-owned ambulance service that serves 23 Arkansas counties and parts of three bordering states, purchased the local hospital a year ago after its previous corporate owner filed for bankruptcy.
In addition to Hempstead County, the Southwest Arkansas Regional Medical Center serves three counties that do not have hospitals: Lafayette, Nevada and the southern portion of Pike. If financial strain closed the hospital, it would leave “a big hole in Southwest Arkansas,” Chief Administrative Officer Shelby Brown said.
“Right now, we have more money going out than we have money coming in,” Brown told the Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee, which met Thursday morning at the hospital.
Brown and Republican Rep. Dolly Henley, who represents Hope and serves on the House Public Health committee, both said they have asked Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her staff to visit the hospital and help them come up with financial solutions. Sanders, who was born in Hope, has not yet visited the facility, Brown and Henley said.

The Legislature distributed nearly $60 million in federal pandemic relief funds to 17 rural hospitals deemed eligible for the aid between 2022 and 2024. Hope’s hospital, then called Wadley Regional Medical Center, did not receive aid from this subset of COVID-19 relief funds.
Medicare and Medicaid make up roughly a combined 66% of the hospital’s payers, Brown said, and many “people who are really at risk see us as their primary care provider.”
The hospital gets paid $12 per Medicaid patient who uses its emergency room for non-emergent primary care, she said.
She also said Southwest Arkansas Regional has applied to be a critical access hospital, a federal designation for facilities located no less than 35 miles from other hospitals and maintaining no more than 25 beds. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsidizes critical access hospitals for inpatient treatment of Medicare recipients.
If CMS approves Southwest Arkansas Regional’s application, it will have to reduce its inpatient beds from 48 to 25. The hospital will also be required to retain intensive care patients for no longer than an average of 96 hours.
Brown said she and other hospital administrators considered seeking rural emergency hospital status, which draws more federal funds to rural hospitals if they reduce or eliminate inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment.
“But if we did that, you have to get rid of all your acute beds, and the community decided that’s not where we need to be,” Brown said.
The Hempstead County Quorum Court and the Hope board of directors each passed resolutions in June 2024 pledging $1,000,000 to support the hospital in 10 installments of $100,000 per month.

 More services needed

After the committee meeting, Brown and Pafford employees led lawmakers on a brief tour of the facility, including the intensive care unit and a Pafford ambulance.
The ICU is technically separate from the hospital and is owned and operated by Pafford, Brown said. The hospital also has a geriatric psychiatric ward.
The hospital wants to add services, such as colonoscopies, “but we need to get our feet planted and financially stable” first, Brown said.
About 25% of local ambulance calls result in a patient refusing to be transferred to a hospital, and this creates expenses with no attached revenue stream, said Pafford marketing director Suzy Barham and Arkansas Ambulance Association President Amanda Newton.
In addition to becoming a critical access hospital, Southwest Arkansas Regional is also in the process of becoming a nonprofit. This will help repay some of the money the Pafford family has invested in keeping the hospital afloat, Brown said, and it will make the hospital eligible for the federal 340B discount prescription drug pricing program.
Lawmakers and local law enforcement officers said another potential revenue stream for the hospital would be mental health services if it had the funding to provide such care. About 20% of county jail inmates in Miller County, Hempstead County’s neighbor to the west, need mental health treatment, Miller County Sheriff Wayne Easley said.
Texarkana, Arkansas, is the Miller County seat and no longer has a hospital, leaving Southwest Arkansas Regional as the closest facility. Texarkana Police Chief Ed Chattaway and Hope Police Chief Kimberly Tomlin both said Hope’s hospital could be a good point of intervention for people whose mental health struggles attract police attention.

“If they aren’t breaking the law and they’re in that limbo spot before something happens, sometimes you have to walk away from people that you know need something,” Tomlin said.
Arkansas has three crisis stabilization units — located in Little Rock, Fort Smith and Jonesboro — established in 2017 as alternatives to incarceration for people with substance use and mental health issues.
Sen. Missy Irvin, a Mountain View Republican and the Senate chair of the Public Health committee, said the units are underfunded and mental health resources need a stronger support system.
“We have to have a collaboration and a partnership to go back and see what’s working, where it’s working and how it’s working,” Irvin said. “It’s going to require a commitment and spend from the Legislature, in my opinion, and I think it’s a worthy spend.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shelby-Brown-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 19:57:57.363547

She, along with 34 other first spouses across the U.S., signed on to a letter dated Sept. 11 to call on Americans to “listen more, eliminate hate and find connection and healing” after highly publicized acts of political violence have rocked the country within the last year.
Manhunt for Charlie Kirk shooter: Rifle found, person of interest photos released

The call comes one day after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University in Orem and three months after Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband was shot and killed by an assailant in their home. That attacker also shot Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, but they survived.
A shooter also fired on U.S. President Donald Trump, and a bystander was killed, at a campaign rally in July 2024 in Pennsylvania before the attacker was shot and killed by the U.S. Secret Service.
“As First Spouses of states and territories across the country, we are in a unique position to both witness and experience the contempt that has permeated our culture,” the first spouses wrote. “Today, we stand together — across political backgrounds — to condemn political violence of every kind.”
The first spouses wrote that they are committed to seeing every American “as a person with inherent dignity and worth,” and that the U.S. system of democracy and unity as a country depends on Americans finding common ground with one another.
“The soul of America is corroded every time hateful rhetoric or violence takes root. Peacemakers are needed in every corner of our society, especially in our politics,” the group wrote. “Our children are watching. They desperately need us to show them a better way.”

(Courtesy of University of South Dakota)South Dakota public university enrollment this fall is 36,091 students, exactly the same as last fall, according to numbers released Thursday by the South Dakota Board of Regents.
Enrollment dropped for two universities and increased by less than 3% at four others:

Black Hills State University in Spearfish increased by 2.36% to 3,425 students.
Dakota State University in Madison grew by 1.8% to 3,842 students.
Northern State University in Aberdeen grew by 0.84% to 3,739 students.
South Dakota Mines in Rapid City decreased by 1.47% to 2,541 students.
South Dakota State University in Brookings grew by 0.61% to 12,139 students.
University of South Dakota in Vermillion decreased by 2.02% to 10,405 students.

System-wide enrollment peaked at 36,662 in 2017, and no year since then has equaled that mark.


The numbers could be a sign of the “2025 cliff” that officials have been fearing, attributed to a lower birth rate during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. There will be a 10% decline in high school graduates nationally from 2025 to 2037, Board of Regents Executive Director Nathan Lukkes told lawmakers last year.
Despite the flat trend overall, more South Dakota high school graduates are pursuing higher education in the state than in recent years, Lukkes said in a news release. South Dakota student enrollment increased this fall to 22,410, a 1% increase over last year, according to system data.
State university enrollment grows by 5% as ‘2025 cliff’ looms

Black Hills State University reported the largest increase in student enrollment this fall by percentage and raw numbers, with 79 more students. It also reported its largest freshman class since 2019 at 500 enrollees, and a 58% increase in Native American enrollment, at 142 students.
South Dakota State University reported the highest percentage increase in full-time enrollment. Dakota State University’s enrollment is a record high for that school, and Northern State University’s enrollment is the highest since at least 1998.
Despite the decline in enrollment at USD, the university reported enrollment at its Sioux Falls campus increased by 19.1%. The university expanded degree programs to the campus in recent years, including its masters in business administration program and a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. The university recently announced that it will move its medical school to Sioux Falls.

The Turning Point USA founder was speaking at an outdoor event with over 3,000 people in attendance when he was shot at Utah Valley University, according to the Utah News Dispatch. Authorities have not arrested Kirk’s shooter as of Thursday evening.
Kirk, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump known for traveling the country and holding debates, has been credited with mobilizing young GOP voters and bringing a more populist conservative movement into the mainstream. His death sparked bipartisan rebukes against political violence nationwide.
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

The attack came at a time of heightened attention to political violence in the United States Then-Republican nominee Trump survived an assassination attempt last summer, with a bullet grazing his ear, while he was campaigning in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family were the victims of arson when the Governor’s Mansion was set aflame while they were asleep. And most recently, former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman was assassinated in her home, while another state senator was gravely wounded in a related attack the same night.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders wrote after Kirk’s death was announced that “America witnessed a cowardly act of evil,” and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton wrote that the act of violence was “heartbreaking.” Sanders said the U.S. was better off because of Kirk, 31.
Many officials characterized the shooting as an assassination, and offered their prayers for Kirk’s wife and children.
“The senseless and evil assassination of Charlie Kirk casts a sad and painful shadow over America tonight,” wrote Attorney General Tim Griffin. “My prayers are with Charlie’s beautiful family — his wife and his two young children — all those who were close to him and our Nation.”
Arkansas Speaker of the House Rep. Brian Evans of Cabot also offered prayers for Kirk’s family — and the university students who witnessed the shooting.

I’m deeply saddened and appalled by the news of Charlie Kirk’s passing and heartbroken by the violence today. My prayers are with his family and with the students who witnessed this horrific attack.
— Brian S. Evans (@AR_HouseSpeaker) September 10, 2025

The chair of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, retired Col. Marcus Jones, released a statement expressing hope that the shooter would be caught quickly.
“Political violence is reprehensible and wrong. Every American should be able to state their opinion — no matter what that opinion is — without facing violence,” Jones wrote. “Even and especially when we disagree with someone, we must all defend their right to use their voice.”
Rep. Carol Dalby, R-Texarkana, referenced the shooting during a prayer she led at Thursday’s Legislative Joint Auditing-Counties and Municipalities hearing, saying the nation was in a “time of turmoil.” She asked God to “help us turn down the rhetoric and help us resolve to listen to others.”
“As each person, no matter the political spectrum, their ideology, their side of an issue, they have a right in our country and a sacred right to be able to speak their words and to express their views,” she said.
Rep David Ray, R-Maumelle, wrote on the social media platform X that the incident was “deeply disturbing and horrific.”
“There’s never an excuse for political violence, regardless of where it comes from. That’s why we have laws, rules, & a constitution: to settle our differences without banana Republic-type atrocities. God help us,” Ray wrote.
Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, wrote Kirk’s death pained him deeply, and that he had been “such a gift to this generation.”
“We don’t kill people because we disagree with them. Charlie was one of the last bastions of civil discourse, and they killed him for it,” Rose wrote in a separate post.

Senate Minority Leader Sen. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, had sharper words, using the moment to call for “Commonsense, bipartisan actions to reduce gun violence.”

The Turning Point USA founder charted the course for several of Wyoming’s most powerful political leaders. 
The post Charlie Kirk influenced Wyoming politics. A local GOP megadonor helped launch his career. appeared first on WyoFile .","When Charlie Kirk was a teenager, he had a chance encounter with Foster Friess, the late Wyoming businessman and Republican megadonor. 
They met in Tampa, Florida, at the 2012 Republican National Convention. Months before, Kirk had formed a new organization to recruit and organize young conservatives on college campuses, naming it Turning Point USA. 
In Tampa, Kirk spotted a man in a cowboy hat at the convention and recognized him as Friess, the New York Times reported earlier this year. 
“I ran into him in a stairwell,” Kirk posted on X in November. “A literal elevator pitch when I was 19.” 
The pitch worked. After the encounter, Friess wrote Kirk’s organization its first $10,000 check. 
Before Friess’ death in 2021, the two men and their families developed a friendship that would help launch Kirk’s career into the conservative stratosphere. At 31, Kirk was among the most influential young Republicans in the United States.
“Foster knew then that Charlie would move the culture and change history… and he did!” Lynn Friess, Foster’s widow, said in a statement posted on X. 
“He’s gone to be with the Lord. We are devastated by this news,” she wrote. 
Charlie Kirk, Lynn Friess and Foster Friess are pictured together. (@fosterfriess/X) 
By the time Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday, he had built one of the most high-profile conservative brands in the country, amassed a social media following in the millions and become a trusted ally to President Donald Trump. 
He’d also helped to set the course for several of Wyoming’s most powerful political leaders. 
“I’ve known Charlie since before his rise to prominence — a salt-of-the-earth man with a beautiful family, driven by an unwavering commitment to his beliefs,” Wyoming Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, said in a statement. 
“My heart aches for his loved ones, his wife and two beautiful children, and my prayers are with them during this unimaginable loss,” Biteman wrote. “This act of political violence is a wound to our nation, and we must stand united against such hatred. Let us honor Charlie’s memory by fostering respectful dialogue over division, and peace over violence.”
Other Wyoming officials echoed Biteman in their own statements, including Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman. 
Additionally, the Wyoming Republican Party called for civil discourse and the Wyoming Democratic Party denounced political violence. 
“In the midst of this tragedy, it is important that we reaffirm the right of all to express their views freely, especially on college campuses, as Mr. Kirk did recently at UW,” University of Wyoming President Ed Seidel said in a statement. 
In April, Kirk spoke on campus after UW’s Turning Point USA student chapter invited him. The event sold out, and Kirk spent the majority of his time on stage debating students, according to The Laramie Reporter. And despite concerns that Kirk’s visit could grow unruly — as Wyoming U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman’s town hall in Laramie did the month prior — no such disruptions occurred.

It was Kirk’s first time speaking on UW’s campus, but not his first visit to Wyoming. 
In 2020, he addressed Republicans at their convention in Gillette, warning them the state could soon be run by Democrats if conservatives didn’t go on the offensive. 
That same year, Kirk got involved in Teton County’s local elections via attack ads, which were unusual for the community at the time. The three candidates endorsed in the mailers also condemned them. 
In 2023, he visited Teton County for the local GOP’s annual fundraiser. A few months later, Kirk weighed in on one of Wyoming’s more high-profile court cases in recent memory. 
After a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against a UW sorority for admitting a transgender woman, Kirk said the student should be imprisoned and he encouraged members of Kappa Kappa Gamma to harass her. 
“These girls should bully this freak,” he said on the Aug. 29, 2023 episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, a popular podcast. 
Not far from the sorority house, a group of about 100 students gathered on campus Wednesday evening to mourn Kirk. They stood together and prayed, some crying, others embracing one another. 
“I met [Kirk] like three years ago, and I was really struggling running this thing because people just didn’t like Turning Point all that much,” Gabe Saint, president of the organization’s UW chapter, told WyoFile at the vigil. 
“And now we’re way more popular, and it’s because of a lot of the stuff Charlie’s done, and how he’s supported us,” Saint said. 
Last December, Saint was awarded Turning Point USA’s student patriot of the year award in Phoenix.

“Spotting an inactive TP USA chapter on campus, [Saint] single-handedly revived it, transforming a four-member club into a powerhouse organization, hosting record-breaking events and reshaping university policy,” Kirk said at the awards event. 
Kirk credited Saint’s leadership with influencing the Wyoming Legislature’s decision to defund diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the university. 
“The sad thing is, like, Charlie, was he hardcore in a lot of his beliefs? Absolutely,” Saint told WyoFile. “But he did it the democratic way by having discourse. And he was shot for doing it the democratic way.” 
While Saint may be responsible for Turning Point’s growing popularity on UW’s campus, it was another student who started the chapter in 2017. 
“At the time, I did not realize how much starting that chapter would shape the rest of my life,” Jessie Rubino said in a statement sent to WyoFile. 
As the Wyoming state director for the State Freedom Caucus Network, it’s Rubino’s job to read and analyze legislation to then guide Wyoming Freedom Caucus members on how they should vote. In 2024, the group won control of the House — the first time a state freedom caucus controlled a legislative chamber in the U.S. 
That work and so much of Rubino’s life “can be traced back to the small group of conservatives who met Thursday nights in the student union in Laramie — all thanks to Charlie,” she wrote. 
She met her closest friends and the man who would become her husband, Joe, “through campus activism (and the Lord’s good hand),” she wrote. Joe Rubino is now a top official in the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office.
“I became connected with the most amazing patriots in Wyoming and across the nation. There are thousands of other people just like me who have been blessed by Charlie’s work,” Jessie Rubino wrote. “I am sickened and saddened, but assured that Charlie is in paradise with the Lord today.”

University Chancellor Glenn Boyce released an official statement on the university’s social media pages Thursday stating that an unnamed employee was terminated after Kirk was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking on the Utah Valley University campus. 
“The comments run completely counter to our institutional values of civility, fairness and respecting the dignity of each person,” the statement said. “We condemn these actions and this staff member is no longer employed by the university.” 
The university did not identify the employee in its statement. It’s just one instance among many Thursday where educators at schools across the country were criticized or fired for their comments about Kirk after his death. 
The employee referred to actions that “reimagined Klan members like Kirk” have taken, ending the post with, “So, no, I have no prayers to offer Kirk or respectable statements against violence.”
Mississippi State Auditor Shad White, a vocal critic of what he calls “woke” initiatives in higher education, shared a post on X that may have alluded to an employee at the university and what was re-shared on social media. 
“To Ole Miss, did an Ole Miss employee just repost this insane reaction to Charlie Kirk’s murder? Answer,” White wrote. 

The attached photos to White’s post names Lauren Stokes, executive assistant to the vice chancellor of development at the university. She also has been publicly identified in other media. Stokes could not be reached for comment.
White’s post also shows the alleged reshared post that reads, ““For decades, yt [white] supremacist and reimagined Klan members like Kirk have wreaked havoc on our communities, condemning children and the populace at large to mass death for the sake of keeping their automatic guns.”
Neither university officials nor White’s office responded to Mississippi Today’s request for comment. 
Kirk was scheduled to appear at Ole Miss on Oct. 29, part of his “The American Comeback tour,” sponsored by his organization. 
It’s another high profile instance where White has used his platform to call out university employees and higher education leaders in the state for their beliefs he says are antithetical to conservative policy. 
In 2020, he pushed for a University of Mississippi professor to be fired after he stopped going to work for two weeks to protest racial inequality. More recently, he’s criticized Tommy Duff, former IHL board member, for his involvement in IHL policies surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion and other topics.  Both are considering a run for governor.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/06180031/OleMiss1-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-11 18:57:21.278544

The state transportation agency has proposed making up a $7.5 million gap in its current budget with cuts to construction projects and “position management savings.”

The Vermont Agency of Transportation released a plan this week to cut $7.5 million from its 2026 fiscal year budget — including more than $2 million in “position management savings” — after state economists lowered revenue projections in July by the same amount.
On Wednesday, the agency sent what’s known as a rescission plan to two Vermont legislative committees tasked with overseeing state spending when lawmakers aren’t in session. Those are the Joint Transportation Oversight Committee and the Joint Fiscal Committee. The latter must approve the agency’s plan before it goes into effect.
The committees are scheduled to meet Sept. 17 and 18, respectively, during which they are set to discuss the plan and hold public hearings on it. The agency was obligated to come up with budget cuts after state economists, at a July meeting with top lawmakers, downgraded previous estimates for how much money the state could expect to bring in to support its transportation system.

At that meeting, economists pointed to lower-than-expected recent revenue from taxes on motor vehicle purchases and from fees collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Over the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June, those receipts saw a sharp drop-off from the state’s initial projections. In the first month of the current fiscal year, this past July, tax revenue from vehicle purchases again underperformed against economists’ expectations, according to the latest state data.
Meanwhile, the state has long faced a decline in gasoline tax revenue as cars have become more fuel-efficient, and as more people purchase electric vehicles. Lawmakers added a new annual fee on electric vehicles last year aimed at curbing some of the impact.
On Wednesday, the transportation agency listed about a dozen line items from its 2026 budget it is looking to cut. 
The largest, according to the list, is $2,254,000 in projected “position management savings,” though the agency did not elaborate. Another $2 million would be saved by delaying a garage project in Springfield, while reductions in tree trimming, mowing and culvert maintenance would together save $915,000, the list states. 
Delaying a rail platform project in Rutland would save another $500,000, while another $230,000 in savings would come from suspending agency employees’ travel and participation in conferences, the list states.
Joe Flynn, the state’s transportation secretary, declined to provide more detail about the plan before it is presented to lawmakers, he said through a spokesperson Thursday.
One of the legislators who will weigh in on the plan next week is Rep. Matt Walker, R-Swanton, chair of the House Transportation Committee. Walker said Thursday the fact that budget cuts are on the table highlights a need for major changes to how the state’s transportation system is paid for.
He said he does not like the idea of cutting any costs lawmakers have already deemed important enough to budget for, such as maintenance to keep roads safe. With transportation revenues failing to keep pace with expenses, lawmakers need to have serious conversations about new ways to pay for key infrastructure, Walker said.
This year, for instance, legislators agreed to halt an annual transfer of about $20 million from the state’s transportation coffers to its general fund for use by the Vermont State Police. But that’s not going to be enough, he warned.
“We’re going to have to close this gap, and all things need to be on the table to do that,” Walker said.

The Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park has long offered a true wilderness experience, with its undeveloped shorelines and remote campsites reachable only by paddling. But after years of back and forth between state officials and the owners of the dam that creates the reservoir, the future of this site still looks uncertain.
Before the state could consider acquiring the facility, it needed a comprehensive picture of the conditions of the Green River Dam and dike and the operational and maintenance costs. A long-awaited study commissioned by lawmakers provided those answers when it was released two weeks ago.
The hydro facility was built in 1947, which raised concerns about whether it would need expensive structural updates. The report finds that the hydro facility is largely safe and performs well and provides estimates for the initial project costs and annual maintenance costs. 
But Gov. Phil Scott made clear last week during a press conference that the state doesn’t have the resources to take over the dam.
The Green River Reservoir’s dam is owned and operated by Morrisville Water & Light, but the utility has been seeking a new owner for the dam, saying they can no longer make a profit operating the facility. The utility argues the state should take it because the state benefits when people visit the Green River Reservoir State Park.
In 2010, Morrisville Water & Light started the process of relicensing the dam with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a step required every few decades. During that process, the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources issued new water quality regulations, which establish how the facility can be operated to align with the federal Clean Water Act.
Morrisville Water & Light claimed that operating the facility under the new permit would limit their power generation capabilities, as the water level in the reservoir would need to be roughly stable, impacting the utility’s ability to do drawdowns and resulting in financial loss. After years of litigation, a Vermont Supreme Court decision ultimately determined the regulations were necessary to meet Vermont water quality standards.

Scott Johnstone, general manager of Morrisville Water & Light, said the utility would no longer be able to operate the hydro facility if it’s not producing revenue through power generation, and it has been exploring options to sell the facility, but no other company has been interested in buying it, for the same reason.
The recent legislative report also states that generating power at the facility with the new water quality permit would result in financial loss.
However, Jon Groveman, policy and water program director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, took issue with that finding. “There’s no analysis that I was able to see,” he said. “Maybe that’s accurate, maybe it’s not.” 
“But even if that is correct,” Groveman added, “it doesn’t change what’s needed to meet the minimum water quality standards.” Groveman emphasized the importance of these standards in maintaining healthy waters and fish habitats.
Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, said some hydropower facilities have experienced a reduction in maximum power production, but not to the extent that they wouldn’t be able to generate power without a financial loss. “This is the only instance my staff are aware of where our regulatory framework produced a result that effectively would not allow power generation to continue, at least not cost effectively,” she said.
But Johnstone said there are two reasons the Green River Dam situation may differ from the others. “The Green River Dam was built to fluctuate and draw down water as all reservoir-based dams do, and essentially the state is no longer supportive of that sort of flow regime even where there’s a reservoir,” he said.
Johnstone added that there are a few other dams in the state that rely on drawdowns from reservoirs, but most of them have bigger rivers flowing into them, whereas the Green River Dam relies mostly on the reservoir because it doesn’t have a significant daily flow.
Secondly, the relicensing process may occur at different times for different facilities, and according to Johnstone, the regulations become stricter as the years pass, and some facilities could have different permits.
According to the study, the most cost-effective option would be to maintain the dam and dike to preserve the reservoir but decommission the hydroelectric facility and cease producing power. In that scenario, the report estimates, the reservoir would generate $32.7 million in visitor spending and $1.5 million in state sales tax revenue over the next 20 years. 
Yet Moore highlighted that the facility is particularly complex to operate, so taking ownership of it would be a significant obligation for the state. “We already are responsible for 100 dams; many of which have costly maintenance needs that we are struggling to keep up with,” she said.
Gov. Scott said during last week’s press conference that he was willing to collaborate with the parties involved to find a solution. But what that solution could look like is still unclear.
“We’re not fighting about the permit anymore. We’ve kind of given up on that,” Johnstone said. Morrisville Water & Light is still following the old regulations, but when federal regulators issue a new license, the utility will have to comply with the new water quality permit.
In the meantime, the utility has started the process to receive federal approval to stop producing power at the Green River Dam.
“We’re going to take care of the facility during this, what we hope is a transition period, but our view is that if we are not going to generate power at that facility anymore, then the use of the dam that is left is to support the state park,” Johnstone said. “So our position is that the state of Vermont should now own that dam because it supports that state park.”
The process of transition could take years, so nothing is expected to change at the Green River Reservoir in the immediate future, but now that the legislative report has been released, the ownership of the dam is likely to become a topic of discussion in the next legislative session.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn a January 2024 proposed rule that would have reduced the discharge of nutrients and pollutants from meat packing plants and slaughterhouses. 
The agency said it chose to withdraw the rules in an effort to prioritize the nation’s food supply and to keep food prices down. 
The proposed rules would have revised effluent limitations guidelines and standards, or ELG,s for the meat and poultry products industry. This industry, which the agency refers to as MPP, includes facilities that slaughter, dress and pack meat and poultry products for human or animal consumption. 
According to EPA, the meat and poultry product industry produces wastewater polluted with nitrogen, phosphorus, oil and grease, biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and chlorides. 
The EPA’s proposed rule from January 2024 said the more stringent effluent limitations would “improve water quality and protect human health and the environment.” EPA said the regulatory guidelines would cost about $232 million annually in social costs and could reduce pollutant discharges by 100 million pounds per year.

EPA said in its withdrawal statement, published in the Federal Register: 
“In the EPA’s judgment, it is not appropriate to impose additional regulation on the MPP industry, given Administration priorities and policy concerns, including protecting food supply and mitigating inflationary prices for American consumers following a protracted period of high inflation from 2020 through 2024.”
Additionally, the withdrawal decision said EPA’s evaluation of the proposed rules showed it would have caused increased air pollution and solid waste that would “negatively impact the environment and public health.”
The shift also reflects, according to the rationale, the agency’s focus on nitrogen and phosphorus from non-point source polluters, rather than point-source polluters. Non-point source pollution – or pollution that cannot be traced to a singular source – makes up the majority of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution that enters U.S. waterways. 
In line with Trump administration
In its rationale for withdrawing the proposed rule, which was published Sept. 3, 2025, EPA said it only has to revise the ELG guidelines “if appropriate” and has “broad discretion” to consider the priorities and policies of the current administration in its decisions.
“At the core of the EPA’s decision is the understanding that the MPP industry plays a critical role in the nation’s food supply chain, and meat and poultry processors have faced an unprecedented disruption in operations and costs in recent years as a result of several factors, including COVID-19 food supply and supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and the unprecedented outbreak of avian flu and New World Screwworm,” the rationale said. 
The rationale said more stringent ELGs on the meat and poultry products industry would lead to “further diversion of the industry’s resources at a critical time.” EPA explained additional limits could cause plants to close or to divert from their a goals of increasing food production and availability. 
The rationale sites several executive orders from President Donald Trump, and recent actions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that show the administration’s priorities for the industry. Closures in the industry, EPA said, could lead to meat shortages and food price increases similar to those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The EPA proposed rules would have regulated water pollution from slaughterhouses and meat packing plants with tools like screening, anaerobic treatments, chemical additions, ultraviolet lights, denitrification, hauling and more. 
In its rationale for withdrawal, EPA said these methods would increase energy demand and therefore lead to increased ozone and fine particulate matter air pollution. 
EPA said the regulatory options would also lead to an estimated 2.5 billion to 8.5 billion-pound increase in solid waste, like animal blood, fluids and excrements, that would have to be sent to landfills or applied to cropland. 
Analysis included in the proposed rules found that the market effect from the additional pollution regulation would be “sufficiently small” and “unlikely to have a noticeable effect on producer or consumer behavior.” It also said the regulatory options would result in a “negligible increase” in required energy generation. 
The proposed rules’ analysis of the regulatory options said it would not “significantly increase” the amount of wastewater treatment sludge generated by the facilities. Estimates in the rules ranged from around 380,000 to 1.2 million pounds of “sludge” annually.
Environmental groups say EPA made the ‘wrong move’ 
In its proposed rules, which were filed under the Biden administration, EPA’s gathered data found that the meat and poultry product industry “discharges the highest phosphorus levels and second highest nitrogen levels of all industrial categories” or point source pollution.
The nutrients, and other pollutants EPA identified as common in the industry, can impact stream health and biodiversity, impact human health and increase drinking water treatment costs. Health risks associated with consuming water high in these pollutants, according to EPA, include infant methemoglobinemia, or blue baby syndrome, colorectal cancer, thyroid disease, neural tube defects and gastrointestinal illness. 
In its environmental impact analysis EPA estimated around 75% of all stream segments below direct and indirect wastewater outfalls from MPP facilities are impaired for at least one pollutant found in MPP wastewater. 
The more stringent guidelines, the proposed rules said, would improve human health outcomes, stream ecology and recreation, drinking water treatment costs and fishing yields, among other things.
The proposed rules were submitted in early 2024 and received thousands of public comments through March 2024, before the current EPA’s decision to withdraw the proposed rules.
Molly Armus, a program manager with the environmental group Friends of the Earth, said EPA’s decision was “a direct contradiction” to the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again directive. 
“For decades, slaughterhouses have dumped toxic waste into our rivers, leaving rural communities to pick up the tab,” Armus said in a statement. “By allowing this pollution to continue unchecked, Trump is once again putting industry profits over clean water and public health.”
Locally, Michael Schmidt, the general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council, said slaughterhouses and packing plants are some of the largest dischargers of nitrate in Iowa. 
Schmidt said even when the industry is regulated, “they don’t always comply with their limits” and referenced a recent settlement from the Iowa Attorney General against a meat packing plant in northeast Iowa that violated its pollution guidelines several times. 
“Rolling back EPA regulations to outdated standards from decades ago is the wrong move,” Schmidt said. “It benefits the near-monopoly international corporations controlling the meat industry, not everyday people. It will not make our water cleaner or Iowans healthier.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA —  Data centers and large manufacturing facilities can pull hundreds of megawatts of electricity from the utility grid. A case in front of Kansas utility regulators has created a new way to ensure costs created by those businesses are fairly distributed among consumers and investors. 
On Oct. 8, the Kansas Corporation Commission will consider a unanimous settlement agreement created after multiple consumer, nonprofit and private interest parties worked to reach agreement on a large load service rate plan and utility tariff. 
A utility tariff sets up a rate structure and terms and conditions of utility services. 
The unanimous agreement designs a rate structure for large-load customers, defined in the agreement as those that reach a peak load of 75 megawatts monthly. 
To put that in perspective, Topeka and Lawrence together probably use about 75 megawatts of electricity per month, said Chuck Caisley, Evergy executive vice president of public affairs. 
Parties involved in the settlement negotiations included KCC staff, Evergy, the Data Center Coalition, the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, school districts, Google LLC, the Sierra Club, multiple industrial businesses and the National Resources Defense Council.
“It’s really going to be, I think, a model for the rest of the United States when it’s all said and done,” Caisley said. “It’s unprecedented when you go into a regulatory proceeding like this on such a complicated issue for all the parties to ultimately walk out and say, ‘This would be fair for everybody.’”
Joseph Astrab, consumer counsel at the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, was part of the negotiations on behalf of small businesses and residential consumers. 
“There’s definitely a lot of compromise here,” Astrab said. “This is a unique document. Normally, we file some initial testimony, respond to the application, kind of setting off positions and preferences. But in this docket, we went straight into technical discussions and planning and more of a collaborative approach with utilities, data center customers and other stakeholders in Kansas, to figure out what’s a good tariff.”
 
Equity between customers
The rise of data centers has pushed forward national policy conversations about large-load users, with the intent often to make sure costs aren’t shifted to other customers or that their significant electricity needs don’t destabilize the grid. The conversations can be at odds with the desire to create a welcoming economic development environment.
The U.S. Department of Energy in January issued a policy statement  about mitigation of financial risks should a large user close, leaving an underutilized utility system, and mitigating resource risks if electricity demand would exceed supply, among other issues. 
Kansas’ proposed tariff addresses multiple factors, including costs large utility users will bear if they terminate their contract early and other safety nets, Caisley said. 
Large-load users will sign a 17-year contract outlining their maximum load projections, he said. Even if the company reduces its electrical demands to 50% or 75% of their projections, the company will be required to pay 80% of that projection, Caisley said.
“There’s no other rate in our system today, not even for giant manufacturers, not for oil refineries, not for the Ford plant, not for the Mars plant – they don’t have a requirement like that,” Caisley said. 
A significant amount of collateral is also required to be posted, he said, amounting to two years of minimum bills, which could run to millions of dollars. 
Astrab said discussions about rate design captured the “unique notion” that capital investments would not have been made until a later date if a large-load customer hadn’t been coming onto the grid at a specific point.
 
‘Novel’ element
A third part of the proposed tariff is what Caisley called the “most novel” and an approach that makes the Kansas plan stand out. An interim capacity charge will be in place on top of the regular electrical rate to pay for additional electricity generation that’s required to meet the new demand, he said. It acknowledges that Evergy may need to invest in expansion plans earlier than expected, which comes with a cost.
“As far as I know, that’s one of the first places in the United States that has that, and so these rates will actually be higher than existing industrial consumer rates, but the data centers acknowledge that it’s an issue of equity and fairness,” Caisley said. “From our perspective, if these data centers cause significant rate increases to existing customers, that’s not ultimately good for the state. It’s not ultimately good for economic development.”
 
Open for business
In strategizing about potential rates, making sure Kansas stayed competitive in drawing companies to locate here was important, Astrab and Caisley said. 
“We think that this will protect existing consumers while enabling economic development in Kansas,” Caisley said. “We’ve been calling it the Goldilocks solution. It’s just right.”
Astrab said Kansas policymakers and the governor’s office have made economic development and attracting large business customers a priority. 
“With that context in mind, we don’t want to be in the way of developing Kansas’ economies and communities and bringing new businesses to the area,” he said. “We definitely want to make sure that if we do something, it’s not going to be so strict or cost-prohibitive for business that they’ll say, ‘No, we can’t come to Kansas.’”
Caisley said he believes Kansas is leading the way. 
“Anytime in today’s society and in the environment that any company or town or regulatory entity operates in today, where you can get everybody with such diverse perspectives and interests around a table and stack hands on something, that means you must have done something right,” he said.

Instead, on Sept. 5, HUD issued a new notice of funding to supersede the funding opportunity WDC applied to in May, effectively canceling $75 million in Continuum of Care Build Program grants already announced by Congress. The new funding opportunity, which included significant changes to eligibility criteria, set an application deadline of 3 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 12.
A one-week turnaround is unrealistic given the extensive revisions to eligibility requirements that require applicants to support the partisan agenda of the Trump administration, say WDC and the National Alliance to End Homelessness in a lawsuit against HUD and HUD Secretary Scott Turner filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The two plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, National Homelessness Law Center, Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and the ACLU of Rhode Island. They claim that HUD’s new eligibility policy is unconstitutional and unlawful because applicants are prohibited from being so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” for immigrants, providing “harm reduction” services for drug users and having inclusive policies for transgender people.
The case, National Alliance to End Homelessness v. Turner, et al., asks the court to block HUD’s unlawful funding restrictions and restore fair access to federal housing funds for providers nationwide. The lawsuit claims projects in 36 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are now ineligible for Continuum of Care Build grants under the Trump administration’s criteria.
“The new notice categorically disqualifies from consideration any entity seeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the Administration disfavors,” the lawsuit states. “And, even in jurisdictions with policies the Administration deems acceptable, entities effectively cannot compete for funding unless they profess agreement with the Administration’s view that sex is binary and immutable and foreswear operating safe injection sites or similar programs designed to reduce the harm from drug use—even with wholly non-federal funds.”
The lawsuit lists the following 36 states where housing development projects would be disqualified under the new grant eligibility criteria: Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Georgia; Hawaii; Idaho; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Maine; Massachusetts; Minnesota; Montana; Nebraska; Nevada; v. New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Texas; Utah; Vermont; Washington; West Virginia; and Wisconsin. 
WDC Executive Director Frank Shea said that attaching political strings to competitive funding programs prevents the organization from providing critical services to the community. WDC has no control over whether the state or the city of Providence is or is not considered a sanctuary or allows a safe injection site.
“This is almost like redlining where entire communities aren’t eligible to apply for federal grants that are congressionally authorized programs using our tax money,” Shea said. “None of it is related to whether the housing is good or we’re using the resources appropriately. It’s just random things.”
WDC’s 14-unit project was part of a larger development to preserve 47 family units across 19 historic buildings, including some for families experiencing homelessness. WDC was working with the Rhode Island Continuum of Care and Sojourner House on the project.
Chip Unruh, a spokesperson for Reed’s office, said the senator is working with his colleagues in Congress “to reverse HUD’s unjust decision and ensure HUD’s Inspector General thoroughly investigates.”
“WDC applied for this competitive grant, they earned it, and clearly deserve it,” Unruh said in an email. “But instead of awarding the funds as Congress intended, Trump officials at HUD decided to rewrite this program – for the second time this year – and change it from a grant that does the hard work of reducing homelessness to an extremist program that ignores what actually works. HUD’s job is to reduce homelessness and expand housing opportunities, not make it harder to do those things.”
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said Thursday afternoon he was still awaiting word on whether a hearing would be scheduled Friday on the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order.
“The new conditions that have been imposed are completely irrelevant to what the grant is about … and designed to simply promote a partisan and ideological agenda of the Trump administration,” Brown said.
The case has been assigned to District Judge Mary S. McElroy.
A HUD spokesperson had not responded to a request for comment as of 6 p.m. Thursday.

In a video message posted on X Wednesday night, Sheriff Ivey, a longtime advocate for the Legislature to pass an open-carry law, said that he had informed his deputies of the policy shift. The statute at issue (790.053) makes it “unlawful for any person to openly carry on or about his or her person any firearm or electric weapon or device.”
“While the opinion at this point is not yet final as the court allows for time for the filing of a motion for rehearing or reconsideration, there’s no reason to expect that the court will reverse its decision,” Ivey said.
He’s not the only sheriff making that move.
The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office, and the Pensacola Police Department will no longer enforce the state’s open carry law either, according to the Pensacola News Journal.
The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office announced on Wednesday that it has informed officers that they cannot detain or arrest solely based on openly carrying a firearm.
The ruling isn’t final until the 15-day window for a rehearing has run out, but the state likely won’t appeal the decision. Ron DeSantis advocated as recently as Monday for the Legislature to change the ban on open carry, and Attorney General James Uthmeier’s said on Wednesday that the court’s ruling was “a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians.”
The ruling is only applicable to the First District, which encompasses most of the counties in North Florida. Brevard County is not within that jurisdiction.
Ivey said he had consulted with Wayne Scheiner, the state attorney in Florida’s 18th Judicial Circuit, as well as the attorney representing the Florida Sheriffs Association. He said he had informed all of the police departments in the county that they no longer needed to enforce the ban.
A spokesperson for the police department in Palm Bay, the largest city in Brevard County, confirmed that it is following suit. “At the direction of the State Attorneys’s Office and Florida Police Chiefs Association, we will not be enforcing that statute as it pertains to open carry,” said Lt. Virginia Kilmer.
Not all law enforcement agencies are dropping enforcement — at least not yet.
“We have not changed our policy,” said Cpl. Jamie Miller with the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department.
“We have not issued a change in policy yet on this matter but it is anticipated soon,” said Javonni Hampton with the Leon County Sheriff’s Department.
Several other sheriffs departments did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Florida Sheriffs Association, nor the attorney general’s office.
In its ruling, the First District noted that the Florida Supreme Court had upheld the ban on open carry in its 2017 ruling of Norman v. State. However, Judge Stephanie Ray wrote that the court felt bound instead to apply a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case called New York State Rifle & Association v. Bruen, which struck down New York’s concealed carry restrictions.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, a vocal opponent, drove more than four hours from her home district to learn more about the facility than has been shared with Democratic lawmakers. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — Frustrated by a dearth of information coming her way, a Nebraska lawmaker showed up unannounced this week at the state prison system’s Work Ethic Camp more than four hours from her home district.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha has been an outspoken critic of Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to repurpose the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention center, which he announced Aug. 19. The planned prison conversion in this rural community of about 7,200 residents came at the State of Nebraska’s request in response to the Trump administration’s deportation push.

Upon her arrival Wednesday, Juarez was provided a guided tour, which the Examiner was not allowed to join. Afterward, she said she was impressed with the grounds and the prison property’s current use: preparing low-risk inmates with programming to ease their reentry into society.
However, she shared concerns. Among them: worries about crowded conditions — both for a future migrant population and for the broader state prison system that will likely absorb the 186 Nebraska inmates being relocated to other prison facilities from a rehabilitative setting in southwest Nebraska.
“There is no way that I believe 300 people could be housed in that McCook facility,” she said, noting that an area of the prison currently used for teaching appeared to be one of the likeliest spaces for expanding bed space. “I can just see them squeezing these double bunk beds into these rooms.”
 Midwest hub for ICE

Pillen has said up to 300 migrants awaiting deportation are to be housed in the repurposed center, which the state will run in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The governor has said he envisions the facility as a Midwestern hub for ICE. 
As of Thursday, the Work Ethic Camp had 155 of its 186 state inmates left to relocate. State senators have said the McCook facility, which opened in 2001, was originally designed for 100.
On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said the state anticipates that the McCook facility will begin housing its new population of migrant federal detainees in October.
After talking with current Work Ethic Camp inmates about their circumstances, Juarez said she wants the state to consider early release rather than relocation for incarcerated people within a year of completing their criminal sentences. 
“To me this circumstance is so unique,” Juarez said. “I’m advocating for as many people to be released as possible. If there are men there that are ready to be let go, I think they should be able to go home.”

Juarez discussed her interaction with one McCook inmate, who told her he had six months until his scheduled release and had earned a spot helping in the prison’s kitchen, where he said he was picking up cooking skills. He told her he was anxious that he could be transferred to a facility with fewer privileges. 
Said Juarez: “What kind of setback are these guys going to be enduring when they get moved?”
A prison system spokesperson, in response, said the department does not have the authority to release individuals early.  (That’s up to the Parole Board.) 
Spokesperson Dayne Urbanovsky said all Correctional Services facilities have a “robust offering” of rehabilitative services.
“As much as possible, NDCS will work to ensure individuals who have started programs at WEC can finish those at other facilities,” she said in a written response.
Furthermore, Correctional Services is partnering with an engineering firm to “safely repurpose (McCook’s) multi-purpose spaces to accommodate additional beds,” Urbanovsky said.
 Closed-door briefing

Juarez is not the only state senator to have recently visited the McCook facility. Two members of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, State Sens. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, stopped in earlier this month.
A day after their visit, the Judiciary Committee held a closed-door meeting with certain state officials. The briefing about the conversion plan was organized by Pillen’s Office and Bosn.
DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, did not sign a letter from 13 progressive state senators , including Juarez, requesting a public hearing about the McCook project before the Judiciary Committee.
Unanswered questions remain about Nebraska-ICE jail after private legislative briefing

After Bosn said the request for such a meeting was premature, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who also signed the letter, announced that the legislative committee he chairs, the Urban Affairs Committee, would hold a public hearing Friday for people to air opinions. That meeting begins at 9 a.m. in room 1507 of the State Capitol. 
The Urban Affairs Committee oversees building codes issues, and McKinney said he is concerned about overcrowding.  
Juarez, a Democrat in her first year as a state lawmaker for South Omaha, said she’s felt frustrated and still wants more details about the McCook-ICE project. She said her visit to the facility better prepares her for future conversations.
“The only reason that I found out as much as I did was because I physically went down there,” she said.

Juarez said it was her understanding that state law, in addition to giving Nebraska state senators access to prisons without prior notice, allows lawmakers to take phones inside to take photographs and videos. She said she was asked to leave hers in a locker.
While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees. For example, she said Work Ethic Camp staff pointed out the current library book selection is written in English. 
Juarez said she could assist in gathering reading material in different languages. She said she also wants to know if the proposed ICE detention center would continue to offer, as do state prisons, mental and other health care services. 
 No signed agreement yet

State officials have acknowledged that many details about the facility have yet to be ironed out. As of Thursday, there still was no signed agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services for the detention center federal officials nicknamed “the Cornhusker Clink.”
Among lawmaker questions is whether the executive branch, Pillen’s administration, has authority to let the feds use the state prison facility. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental reformatory and penal institutions.”
Pillen, however, has cited an article in the Nebraska Constitution saying that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.” He also argues state statute gives him authority through its creation of the Department of Correctional Services.
What’s in a name? Fed moniker for Nebraska immigration jail draws ire and defense

From the start, Pillen has said he felt a responsibility to support the president’s immigration agenda and wanted Nebraska to do its “fair share.” He has said that he and other Republican governors have heard President Donald Trump’s call to “step up” — and that he was proud to also empower the state’s Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska State Patrol to become a part of Trump’s mass deportation mission. 
Many Republican state senators in the officially nonpartisan Legislature also have expressed support for the governor’s position on immigration.
A University of Nebraska-Lincoln law professor who studies the impact of detention said the project offers “spectacle, not safety or stability.” Danielle Jefferis, in an opinion piece Thursday in the Nebraska Examiner, said the Nebraska prison system has traditionally argued that “rehabilitation matters” but that the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds.
“That choice is not only about corrections policy,” she wrote. “It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.”
 Skeptical of future

In an interview with the Examiner Wednesday outside of the Work Ethic Camp, Juarez said she was less anxious about what might be ahead for ICE detainees after she saw the prison’s grounds, including an outdoor recreational courtyard.

“I felt a little more calm than I had anticipated once I was inside,” she said. 
But she said she was unclear and remained skeptical about how operations might change under an ICE contract and said her visit would be the first of more. Her underlying feeling, she said, is that migrants working in the U.S. without a criminal or violent past shouldn’t be held behind bars.
After her tour of the work camp, Juarez dropped off some “We are Friends of Immigrants” signs to local residents who had requested them from an Omaha group that has protested the ICE facility. Juarez told McCook residents that she planned to continue to monitor the changes.
“I’ll be coming back,” she said.

Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, testifies Thursday against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver warned Missouri lawmakers Thursday that the effort to redraw the 5th District seat to favor Republicans will be long remembered by voters who resent being swapped by politicians seeking to increase their power.
Speaking to the Senate Local Government, Elections and Pensions Committee, Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat, noted that Texas has already revised district lines this year to favor Republicans and California will vote later this year on a plan that favors Democrats.
President Donald Trump is demanding the changes to help Republicans keep their slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Democrats are fighting back in the states they control.
“If we fight fire with fire long enough,” Cleaver said, “all we’ll have left is ashes.”
Cleaver’s warning went unheeded and the committee, on a 6-2 party-line vote a few hours later, sent the redistricting plan, which has already passed the Missouri House, to the Senate for debate. By the same vote, the committee also approved a proposal altering how majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
Both pieces of legislation will be debated Friday, with Republicans apparently ready to shut down debate as they did to push through rules changes on Wednesday.
During the hearing, Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, said he expects little or no debate on Friday.
“They’re going to shut us down,” Beck said. “They’re not going to let us speak on this, because it’s inconvenient.”
There was some grumbling about the process from one Republican, state Sen. Joe Nicola of Grain Valley, who said he has been told he can speak on the floor about the legislation but that no amendments will be accepted.
“When I don’t have my voice, the 185,000 people I represent also lose their voice, and that’s extremely irritating to me,” Nicola said. “I’ve seen many processes here, and even recently, the rules being broken. And it’s just a shame. It’s a real shame for this institution.”
Nicola voted for both pieces of legislation in the committee.
Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. Cleaver represents the 5th DIstrict, which includes most of Kansas City and Jackson County. The other Democrat, U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell, represents the 1st District in St. Louis.
Cleaver said he skipped votes in Washington to make the rare appearance for a member of Congress before a state legislative committee. 
“I chose to miss (Wednesday) votes, and I chose to miss the ones today, because I thought this was extremely important,” Cleaver said.
The 5th District, which he has represented since 2005, would be carved up, with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts while heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County, would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, speaks to reporters Thursday after testifying against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Cleaver said he is saddened by the bill and the need to explain how he works to represent all points of view and work with Missouri Republicans in Congress on the state’s behalf.
Polling, Cleaver said, shows voters oppose the redistricting plan. 
“This is immensely unpopular, so I was not just here representing myself,” Cleaver said. “I’m representing the people of this district.”
And, he said, he intends to seek re-election.
“A lot goes into making another decision,” Cleaver said. “But right now, I’m running.”
No one from the public spoke in favor of the bill. While state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel who sponsored the bill, was testifying, he was challenged by state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City, on the origin of the new map.
Deaton said it was drawn in Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office before the special session was called. 
Nurrenbern said she did not believe it.
“I think it is a lot of BS what you guys keep doing, that you’re saying that this map was drawn in the state of Missouri,” Nurrenbern said. “We all know the truth, representative. We all know that this came straight from D.C.”
Deaton said he accepted Kehoe’s word that the bill was drafted in his office. 
“People in Washington, D.C., as I’ve observed them, are not shy,” Deaton said. “If they had a map, I assume they would have been willing to put it out there and say, ‘we think this is a wonderful map. We hope Missouri would adopt it.’”
Final passage on Friday won’t automatically put the maps into place for next year’s election. The bill will take effect 90 days after the special session ends, but plans are being made by labor unions and others to seek a referendum, which would delay implementation until a statewide vote.
And opponents promised the bill will be challenged in court. The Missouri Constitution directs lawmakers to draw new congressional district lines after every decennial census. The current map was passed in 2022 and the next census is in 2030.
Denise Lieberman of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition said she believes the constitution does not allow a new map to be imposed now.
“This map is also subject to a challenge under the Voting Rights Act for the dilution of African-American votes,” Lieberman said. 
Cleaver is Black and the line chosen for part of the district boundary, Troost Avenue, was the line separating Black and white sections of Kansas City when housing segregation was legal, Lieberman said.
“This is an unprecedented power grab here in Missouri,” she said.
 Initiative petition changes

The hearing on the changes to the initiative process brought some testy exchanges between Democrats and Republicans.
Currently, any proposal placed on a statewide ballot needs only a majority of votes to pass. That is the standard for constitutional amendments, statutory changes and proposals subject to a referendum.
The proposed changes, which would be on a ballot and subject to the current standard for passage, would only apply to constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petitions. Along with a statewide majority, those constitutional amendments would also need a majority vote in their favor in all eight congressional districts.
If one district opposed a ballot measure while the other seven passed it, as few as 5.3% of voters could control the outcome for the whole state.
“The main purpose is to protect the Constitution from changes that the majority of all the voters in Missouri, in every area of the state, don’t agree with,” said state Rep. Ed Lewis, a Republican from Moberly, as he presented the bill to the Senate committee.
As the committee was voting, Beck tried to make it subject to the same majority requirements it would impose on citizen initiative petitions.
“If this is such a great idea and we are going to change the constitution, and this is the best way to do it, why don’t we use that same standard for the legislature changing it as the initiative process,” Beck said.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, said Beck was being “too clever” and joined other Republicans in voting down the proposal.
“The whole point of this is to set those standards and to change those standards,” Brattin said, “but it has to be adopted by the current standard.”

Kevin Stitt on Thursday appointed three officials to his administration, all of whom he has previously named to other positions in Oklahoma state government. 
Stitt appointed Donelle Harder as Oklahoma Secretary of State, David Ostrowe as chief operating officer and Dustin Hilliary as his senior advisor. 
“We successfully launched this administration by bringing a fresh set of eyes from Oklahoma’s business community, and we will finish the same way,” Stitt said in a statement. “These three outstanding Oklahomans bring diverse strengths: Dustin’s trusted leadership and negotiation prowess, David’s operational acumen, and Donelle’s strategic vision.”
The appointments follow the resignations of Josh Cockroft, who serves as secretary of state and Stitt’s chief policy advisor, and Rick Rose, the head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and Oklahoma’s chief operating officer. Cockcroft’s resignation is effective Oct. 2 while Rose plans to depart Sept. 26.

Harder previously served as Stitt’s senior advisor and deputy Secretary of State and worked as his spokesperson and campaign manager. She also previously worked as former U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe’s spokesperson. 
In the private sector, she sold her regional public relations and marketing firm to Pinkston in 2022, and she became one of the company’s senior vice presidents. 
“I’m honored to serve as Secretary of State and support Governor Stitt’s administration again,” Harder said in a statement. “I look forward to sharpening our strategic approach and ensuring this administration remains effective and focused on delivering good government for the people of Oklahoma.”
Her appointment is effective Oct. 1. 
Ostrowe will return to Stitt’s administration as the chief operating officer and secretary to “drive cabinet coordination and support agency directors.”

He currently serves as president and CEO of O&M Restaurant Group leading brand expansions across states. 
During Stitt’s first term, Ostrowe served as Oklahoma’s first Secretary of Digital Transformation and Administration. He was indicted by former Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter in late 2020 for allegedly bribing a state official. Ostrowe was accused of threatening to cut funding from the state Tax Commission if commissioners didn’t waive penalties and interests on a tax debt. 
Current Attorney General Gentner Drummond dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled, and apologized to Ostrowe on behalf of the state after he took office. He said Ostrowe should not have been indicted and did nothing wrong.
“In Governor Stitt’s first administration, we worked with passion to deliver digital transformation and make government more efficient and transparent,” Ostrowe said in a statement. “I am honored to return as COO to help finish that mission and continue advancing good government for all Oklahomans.”

Hilliary, Stitt’s new senior advisor and chief negotiator, also serves as the vice chair of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. It was not immediately clear if he would continue serving in both roles. 
He is co-CEO of Hilliary Communications, which provides telephone and broadband service to customers in Oklahoma, Texas and Iowa. Hilliary is also co-publisher of the Hilliary Media Group, a media holding company, and operates a real estate development company.
“It is an honor to serve Oklahoma and to work alongside Governor Stitt in his final term to advance policies with the Legislature that put our state on a strong path today and for future generations,” Hilliary said in a statement.
The salaries of all three appointees were not immediately provided by the Governor’s Office.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)One day after announcing a deal with Japan’s largest electrical producer, the lead developer of the proposed trans-Alaska gas pipeline has revealed a second agreement, this time with POSCO International Corp. a South Korean steel manufacturer.
A spokesperson for Glenfarne, the firm advancing the pipeline project, declined to make the terms of the agreement available on Thursday.
Glenfarne released a statement saying that the agreement includes terms for POSCO to buy 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year from the pipeline, if built. 
“This agreement will include initial terms for POSCO to supply a significant portion of the steel required for Alaska LNG’s 807-mile, 42-inch pressurized natural gas pipeline,” the statement said.
Glenfarne owns 75% of AKLNG, as the proposed pipeline project is also known, which would transport liquified natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to the Kenai Peninsula for sale and export. The remaining 25% of the project is held by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. The two companies are pursuing the pipeline via a co-owned subsidiary, 8 Star Alaska.
Rex Cannon, co-president of 8 Star Alaska, said last month that the firm intends to make a final investment decision on the first phase of the project before the end of the year.
That first phase would consist of a pipeline for in-state gas customers. The second phase of the project includes a gas treatment facility and an export terminal on the Kenai Peninsula. A final investment decision on that aspect is expected in 2026.
Based on public announcements, 8 Star Alaska has not signed enough gas purchase agreements from North Slope producers to meet expected demand.
Previous proposed gas pipeline projects have failed in large part due to funding issues. Cannon said in August that 8 Star Alaska is pursuing federal loans from the Trump administration, and loans from outside investors in order to fund construction.
Gas purchase agreements like the ones announced this week are believed to be a key first step in showing the project is economical and worth investment.
The AKLNG pipeline is expected to have a final capacity of 20 million tons of natural gas per year. As of  Thursday, Glenfarne has announced preliminary commitments from buyers for approximately 12 million tons per year. 
Earlier this year, POSCO Holdings Inc., the parent company of POSCO International, said it was seeking to expand its liquefied natural gas businesses, partially in an effort to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s drive to boost U.S. exports.
Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly said that he sees the development of Alaska as a top priority.

(Photo courtesy of Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation)On Feb. 13, 2019, Tennessee lawmakers officially recognized the Orange Heart Medal, becoming the first state in the country to do so. Since that time, a number of other states have followed the Volunteer State’s lead. 
The Beehive State is currently not among the states that have formally recognized the Orange Heart Medal. Is there really any need for Utah legislators to approve an Orange Heart Medal to honor victims of Agent Orange exposure?
One could argue that Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides don’t really need any more recognition for their sacrifice.  After all, those veterans have already received an official federal service medal, the Vietnam Service Medal.
Additionally, Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange and other toxic herbicides during the war are eligible for compensation from the Veterans Administration for illnesses associated with exposure to those chemicals. 
While the Vietnam Service Medal is a prestigious medal, it is awarded for a specific period of service performed in a specific area. A number of different awards are also authorized for circumstances that took place during the same period covered by the Vietnam Service Medal.
One notable example is the Purple Heart. That medal is awarded to service members wounded in action during wartime. It is not that uncommon for a veteran to receive a service medal and a Purple Heart during the same war.
In the case of VA compensation, many veterans do receive benefits for presumptive conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. However, the VA currently only recognizes a certain number of presumptive health issues linked to toxic herbicide exposure. That number could well increase.
Regardless of VA compensation for Agent Orange related illnesses received by eligible veterans, Purple Heart recipients also receive VA benefits in certain cases. One example is a veteran who became disabled due to a wound received in combat.  
A key difference between veterans who receive a Purple Heart and an Orange Heart Medal is the nature of the injury sustained. Purple Heart recipients were wounded externally, while Orange Heart Medal recipients were wounded internally. 
Like veterans who have received a Purple Heart for their obvious wounds, veterans exposed to Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides during the Vietnam War deserve an Orange Heart Medal for their inconspicuous wounds.
This rationale compelled Vietnam veteran Ken Gamble, founder and president of the Orange Heart Medal Foundation in Springfield, Tennessee, to design and create the Orange Heart Medal. 
Ken hopes the medal will eventually be approved in every state in the country. And there are certainly veterans in Utah who feel the same way. That was made clear by a recent Orange Heart Medal pinning ceremony in Sunset’s Rachael Runyan Memorial Park.
On Aug. 9, Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation Chairman Larry Kerr presented an Orange Heart Medal to Sunset veteran Robert F. Smalling in a solemn and emotional pinning ceremony. It was a ceremony that will no doubt take place with much greater frequency throughout the Beehive State.
The Orange Heart Medal is a very meaningful way to recognize veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange. So it is not really a question of whether lawmakers should approve an Orange Heart Medal. The real question is when will lawmakers approve a Utah Orange Heart Medal?",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Robert_F_Smalling_Orange_Heart_Medal-1024x967.jpg,,,2025-09-11 17:57:04.340222

Spencer Cox talks to media after conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hours after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, a morose Utah Gov. Spencer Cox took the podium at a news conference alongside state and federal law enforcement officials. 
Cox — a Republican who has devoted a large part of his political career trying to encourage bipartisanship in an increasingly politically polarized world — did more than condemn Kirk’s killing, calling it a “political assassination.” 
“This is a dark day for our state,” the governor said. “It’s a tragic day for our nation.”
Though Cox has tried to combat polarization in favor of civil discourse through his Disagree Better campaign, his home state made worldwide headlines for the very thing he’s tried to discourage. Politico’s headline put it this way: “Utah is now the epicenter of the political divide its governor warned about.” 
While speaking about Kirk’s killing on Wednesday, Cox made another plea. He urged Utahns and Americans to look at the bigger picture of increased political violence happening across the country — and also look inward. 
“Our nation is broken,” he said. 

“Our nation is broken.”

Cox pointed to the assassination of Minnesota House Democratic leader Melissa Hortman and her husband, the firebombing of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home that prosecutors say was attempted murder, and attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. 
“Nothing I say can unite us as a country. Nothing I can say right now can fix what is broken,” he said. “Nothing I can say can bring back Charlie Kirk. Our hearts are broken.” 
As Cox gave his solemn speech, state public safety and FBI officials were hunting for the suspected shooter, who as of Thursday had still not been found. 
“Charlie Kirk was, first and foremost, a husband and a dad to two young children,” Cox said. “We mourn with his wife, his children, his families, his friends. We mourn as a nation.” 
Manhunt for Charlie Kirk shooter: Rifle found, person of interest photos released

Kirk was also founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions, and a close ally of President Donald Trump. He was a widely known and often polarizing internet personality. 
That political involvement brought Kirk to Utah Valley University, one of the many college campuses across the U.S. where Kirk engaged students and members of the public in political debate with his signature “prove me wrong” events. But UVU was his last. 
An estimated 3,000 people attended Wednesday’s event. After the single gunshot rang out and Kirk collapsed from a bullet to his neck, students scattered, screaming in horror.  It was a moment that hundreds of students witnessed firsthand and now millions more around the world are viewing in viral, graphic videos that continue to spread on social media.
Cox lamented that university campuses are supposed to be places for students to learn and grow, not places where students fear for their safety.

“Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate, to shape ideas and to persuade people,” the governor said. “Historically, our university campuses in this nation and here in the state of Utah, have been the place where truth and ideas are formulated and debated. And that’s what he does. He comes on college campuses and he debates.” 
Free speech and debate are “foundational to the formation of our country, to our most basic constitutional rights,” Cox said. “And when someone takes the life of a person because of their ideas or their ideals, then that very constitutional foundation is threatened.”
As of Thursday, law enforcement officials had not released any information about the shooter’s motive and the investigation is ongoing. 
“I want to make it crystal clear right now, to whoever did this, we will find you. We will try you. And we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law,” Cox said. “And I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah.”
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

Cox also condemned anyone who may have reacted to Kirk’s killing with any level of celebration. 
“If anyone, in the sound of my voice, celebrated even a little bit at the news of the shooting, I would beg you to look in the mirror,” Cox said, “and see if you can find a better angel in there somewhere.” 
The governor said he didn’t care what Kirk’s politics were — “I care that he was an American.” 
“We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be. To ask ourselves, is this it? Is this what 250 years has brought on us? I pray that that’s not the case,” he said, pointing to the upcoming anniversary of the nation’s founding. 
Cox said he also prayed that “those who hated what Charlie Kirk stood for will put down their social media and their pens and pray for his family.” 
“And that all of us — all of us — will try to find a way to stop hating our fellow Americans,” Cox said.

Four public hearings this fall will review the reassessment process, property tax impacts, and education funding, as Republicans question the effort’s bipartisanship.
By Brent Burdge, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE
DOVER — September 3, 2025 — Delaware lawmakers have created special House and Senate committees to review the state’s first comprehensive property reassessment in more than four decades, aiming to evaluate the process, its impacts on property taxes and education funding, and possible legislative responses.
House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown (D) and Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola (D) announced the committee assignments on Wednesday, emphasizing transparency and public engagement. The committees are scheduled to hold four public hearings between September and November, which will be livestreamed from Legislative Hall.
Purpose of the Committees
Legislative leaders said the committees are intended to identify lessons from the reassessment, recommend process improvements, and explore targeted tax relief options for Delawareans who may be facing significant property tax changes.
“We know that there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the reassessment process – both for Delawareans and for lawmakers,” said Speaker Minor-Brown. “These committees are about finding those answers and putting together a thoughtful roadmap that we can act on in the coming legislative session.”
Senate Majority Leader Bryan Townsend (D) said committee members were chosen for geographic balance and policy experience in housing and land use. “I look forward to putting our heads down and working together over the coming months to really drill down on what happened, and make recommendations about how we can move forward on behalf of the people of Delaware,” Townsend said.

Public Hearings: Topics and Timeline
The committees will hold four public hearings this fall, each addressing a different set of issues:

Week of September 22 – Review of the 2024 reassessment process

County-level practices, Tyler Technologies’ methodology, intergovernmental coordination, error safeguards, appeals process, and an update on emergency legislation passed August 12.


Week of October 6 – Future reassessments and tax structures

Comparative models from other states, potential differentiated tax rates by property type or size, and county-level capacity to implement such systems.


Week of October 20 – Delaware property tax framework and exemptions

Programs for taxpayers on fixed incomes or facing hardship, comparison to other states, and potential updates to property tax exemptions.


Week of November 3 – Property reassessment and education funding

The reassessment’s relationship to Delaware’s education funding system and the legal settlement that prompted the 2024 reassessment, as well as coordination with the Public Education Funding Commission.



Republican Caucus Raises Concerns Over Process
Following the announcement, the House Republican Caucus issued a statement criticizing how Democratic leaders initiated the reassessment review effort, arguing that Republican proposals were sidelined and that the committees were formed without bipartisan consultation.
“Democrats hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers: 27 of 41 seats in the House and 15 of 21 in the Senate. And they’ve used these numbers to dictate the reassessment debate in an entirely partisan fashion,” the statement said.
Republicans said they were not given input or advance notice about the new committees and argued that earlier Republican-sponsored bills — including measures to double the senior property tax credit (HB 73) and limit tax hikes tied to reassessment (HB 245 and HB 246) — were ignored during the recent special session.
The statement also questioned the committee’s bipartisan nature:
“It’s clear Republican participation will serve only as window dressing, a superficial gesture intended solely to lend a veneer of bipartisanship to a process that is anything but.”
Looking Ahead
All committee meetings will be open to the public and livestreamed at legis.delaware.gov. Legislative leaders said additional details on the hearings and opportunities for public engagement will be announced in the coming days.
While Democrats frame the committees as a step toward transparency and solutions, and Republicans voice skepticism about the process, the hearings will give Delawareans a rare, statewide look at the property reassessment system and its potential long-term effects on taxes and school funding.

“We’re supporting a major expansion in food production, investing in renewable energy, and fueling local economic development,” Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a press release. “Each project strengthens our communities and ensures long-term growth for our state.”  
The Board of Economic Development approved the awards Wednesday. 
Bel Brands, known for producing mini-cheese wheels dipped in red wax, received approval for a state loan of up to $10 million. The loan, offered through the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative (REDI) Fund, provides low-interest, long-term financing for companies that want to expand or relocate in South Dakota. The company plans to build an additional 100,000 square feet of space at its Brookings plant, which would double its production capacity.
Grant Solar LLC received approval for up to $2.8 million in tax relief through the Reinvestment Payment Program to help build a 585-acre solar power facility in McCook County. The program refunds a portion of the state sales and use taxes paid on construction costs, with the goal of making capital projects more affordable to build in the state. Bel Brands was previously awarded up to $2.6 million in tax relief from the same program for its expansion.
Ally Dakota Development, a group with offices in Watertown and Rapid City that provides development support to local businesses, was awarded a $7,500 grant through the state’s Economic Development Partnership Program. The program provides small grants to help local organizations hire staff, run programs, or carry out projects that support business growth.

The six-page opinion overturned a circuit court judge’s decision last week that the state must hold onto its data on 3.3 million registered voters — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — while a lawsuit plays out over privacy concerns.
The U.S. Department of Justice asked for that information last month as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.

Opinopm 
Under the Supreme Court’s decision, the state Election Commission could hand over its voter information right away, said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is representing a voter suing to stop the release of her personal information.
Whether the commission will do so is unclear. An agency spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.
The agency began working to comply with the Trump administration’s request Aug. 27, three weeks after it sent the first of two letters asking for the information, spokesman John Michael Catalano said previously. The Department of Justice set a due date of Sept. 5, two days after the circuit court judge’s order barred the state from complying.
The Supreme Court’s order, which all five justices signed, didn’t get into the questions of privacy raised in the lawsuit. Instead, justices focused on procedural issues in the order barring the state from fulfilling the request.
Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein didn’t explain in her order what sort of damage Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the lawsuit, might face if the state gives her information to the federal government, according to the Supreme Court’s order. Goodstein also failed to explain whether she believed the lawsuit was likely to succeed, which is required for a court to intervene, the order reads.
Goodstein told the Election Commission not to comply with the request before the agency had even received notice of the lawsuit, which was filed Aug. 29 ahead of the Labor Day weekend. That on its own violates longstanding court precedent, the state’s highest court said.
She scheduled a hearing for Wednesday morning in Aiken County but canceled it after the state Election Commission appealed to the Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will continue. Justices made it clear Crook can still ask for a hearing in her case. Where and when that might happen is still to be determined.
“We still are going to get our day in court,” said Hutto, D-Orangeburg.
Governor joins the lawsuit
Although the initial lawsuit didn’t name Gov. Henry McMaster as a defendant, he asked to join in defense of the state Election Commission.
The request “should not be a big deal,” McMaster’s attorney wrote last Thursday in response to the lawsuit.
Anyone can purchase partial voter records, including full names, addresses and birthdays. Also, federal agencies — including the IRS and Social Security Administration — already have most of the information requested, McMaster’s filing argued.
“The federal government already has Crook’s full Social Security number (as well as every other South Carolinian’s) because the federal government issues those Social Security numbers,” the governor’s attorney wrote. “It’s untenable (to put it mildly) to insist that the State cannot tell the federal government something that the federal government already knows.”
The governor’s office did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment on the high court’s decision.
Judge temporarily blocks release of SC voter data to Trump administration

While it’s true that some government agencies have access to personal information, the Department of Justice clearly isn’t among them, Hutto said. If it were, the agency wouldn’t be asking for states to provide that information, he said.
McMaster told reporters last week that he would like to enter a formal agreement with the Department of Justice making it clear that the agency will respect voters’ privacy rights.
However, those privacy rights don’t extend to voter registration information, his attorneys argued in a court filing. South Carolinians have a right to privacy only from electronic surveillance and in cases of bodily autonomy, McMaster’s filing reads.
Federal law gives government agencies the authority to get whatever data they need to fulfill their obligations, McMaster’s attorneys argued. That includes the Department of Justice, which is tasked with enforcing voter laws, his office wrote.
“Nothing is unreasonable about giving the federal government information it already has (Social Security numbers) or information that Congress has authorized it to obtain (driver’s license numbers),” the filing reads.
Those laws apply only if the agency has a good reason to get the information, which the Department of Justice hasn’t proven, Hutto argued.
If the Department of Justice said exactly what it planned to do with people’s personal information, voters like Crook might not be so concerned about violations to their privacy, Hutto said.
“Why do they need to know?” Hutto said. “That is the very data everyone says we need to safeguard from identity theft.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Headquarters-Voting-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

Wirth subsequently issued a statement mid-afternoon acknowledging that a threat had been made against him, “leading to disruption and an evacuation at schools in my neighborhood. I am grateful to our state and local law enforcement agencies for their swift and professional response to this serious matter, and to the school officials who skillfully managed the disturbance.”
“Political violence and threats against elected officials have no place in our democratic society and are never an acceptable way to address political differences. Regardless of our political views, we must reject intimidation and work together through peaceful, lawful means to resolve our disagreements.”

Wirth concluded the statement by saying he remains “committed to fostering respectful civic dialogue and protecting the safety of all who serve our community.”
New Mexico State Police initially posted on social media a little after 12 p.m. on Thursday that a bomb threat had been called in somewhere in the area of Camino De Cruz Blanca in Santa Fe between Camino Del Monte Sol and Calle Romolo. 
A statement from City of Santa Fe Deputy Police Chief Ben Valdez provided to Source said that city and state police initially responded to a bomb threat in the 1000 block of Camino de Cruz Blanca at approximately 10:40 am.  SFPD provided patrol officers for scene security and traffic control, and its Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit to investigate the threat.
“Contact was made with leadership at Santa Fe Prep to inform them of an incident near their campus. Santa Fe Prep was evacuated, parents were contacted to pick up their students.  Both NMSP and SFPD were present with the students and faculty as a controlled release was conducted and students were released to their parents,” Valdez’s statement said.

At the same time, Santa Fe Police received “another threat of the same nature” on a nearby street.

“Out of an abundance of caution, considering yesterday’s senseless killing of political activist Charlie Kirk, City Hall was placed on a lockdown,” Valdez wrote. That lockdown was lifted at 1:47 p.m.

“We take all threats seriously,” Valdez’s statement said. “They have no place in our community and individuals that make threats will be held accountable.”
In the aftermath of Wednesday’s fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, threats Thursday at colleges in Virginia and Historically Black Colleges and University campuses across the country have led to lockdowns and canceled classes.

Thomas/Getty Images).A Jackson County judge is weighing whether to keep in place two state regulations that Planned Parenthood says are preventing its providers from performing medication abortions in Missouri.
Over the course of several hours Wednesday, attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office argued before Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang over whether current regulations on abortion medication — the most common kind of abortion — are a necessary safeguard or onerous and unconstitutional.
In November, Missouri voters legalized abortion up to fetal viability. But abortion remains widely inaccessible to most Missourians as a number of related legal cases play out in the courts. 
Procedural abortions are again accessible on a limited schedule at Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. But medication abortions are not available because Planned Parenthood does not have an approved medication abortion complication plan or supplemental insurance required by state regulations.
Missouri abortion rights amendment trumps most restrictions, judge rules

Planned Parenthood continues to argue that these restrictions fly in the face of the abortion rights amendment, which reads: “The government shall not discriminate against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care or assisting another person in doing so.”
Peter Donohue, an assistant attorney general involved in the lawsuit, argued Wednesday that “regulation and medicine go together.”
Vanessa Pai-Thompson, an attorney for Planned Parenthood, countered that the complication plan puts the state “squarely between patients and providers” by forcing “medically unnecessary requirements.” 
In late March, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services rejected Planned Parenthood’s complication plan, stating that it did not meet the requirements of a new emergency rule published the same day by the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office. 
That rule requires the complication plan for any facility prescribing abortion medication to more than 10 women a month must: 

Have an on-call OB-GYN who lives within 25 miles of the clinic available at all times for seven days after a patient takes the medication. This physician would be required to treat any complications that arise as a result of the medication unless the standard of care requires someone else to treat them. 
Provide for patients who live further than 25 miles from the clinic the name of the emergency room and a physician “within a reasonable distance of the location where the patient will complete the abortion.”
Submit the full names of all physicians involved in the local complication plans.

A medication abortion requires two different kinds of pills. The first, mifepristone, causes the embryo or fetus to stop growing and detach from the uterine wall, ending the pregnancy. The second, misoprostol, causes the uterus to expel the pregnancy tissue. 
Both medications can also be used to treat miscarriages.
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects. Hemorrhaging and infection are among rare complications. 
Since the medication was approved for use 28 years ago, 32 deaths have been reported associated with mifepristone, according to the FDA. The report evaluates data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Wednesday’s hearing included testimony from two OB-GYNS: Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, and Dr. Ingrid Skop, vice president and director of medical affairs for Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion research group.
Baum said a complication plan is not required when she performs vasectomies at the clinic, even though she said the risk of infection is greater for that procedure.
Between April 2018 and August 2023, there were 438 abortion complication reports — including 186 from medication abortions — filed with Missouri’s health department. Details on individual cases were not presented. 
In her testimony, Skop suggested the number of complications could be higher. It is difficult to collect accurate data, she claimed, because many women are advised by abortion providers not to tell primary care or emergency room doctors that they had an abortion if seeking further treatment. 
Baum said that’s because miscarriage and medication abortion present the same and require the same treatment, so choosing not to disclose an abortion can protect a patient’s privacy. She added that when she administers mifepristone to patients at her clinics in Illinois before sending them home with a dose of misoprostol, she gives them multiple ways to reach a provider if they have concerns that they are bleeding too much or are experiencing any other complications.
Missouri law also requires providers prescribing abortion medication to carry tail insurance, a supplemental plan to medical malpractice insurance that would extend coverage for 21 years following the administration of the medication in case there is a claim of “personal injury to or death of a child who survives such abortion.”
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood have argued in briefings that this 2019 law is also discriminatory because it’s not required for other medical events such as childbirth, which carries much higher risks of injury or death. 
Among the state’s witnesses was Melissa Ohden, founder and CEO of the Abortion Survivors Network, based in Kansas City, which connects women who underwent failed abortions and their families with resources. Ohden is also an outspoken opponent of any abortion exceptions. 
“The reality is that abortions fail far more frequently than women are told about,” she testified Wednesday, based on anecdotal data she said she’s gathered over years of working with thousands of people through her organization.
If a medication abortion fails, patients can take another dose of medication or undergo an in-clinic abortion, according to Planned Parenthood’s website.
While Pai-Thompson, Planned Parenthood’s attorney, said the restriction is another attempt to subject abortion providers to licensing penalties, Donohue argued it was in place to protect doctors. 
A “rural woman” might not know a “big, fancy” medical word like mifepristone, Donohue said. He then gave a hypothetical of a woman accidentally “overdosing” on mifepristone because her local doctor didn’t have access to medical records indicating she was already prescribed mifepristone by Planned Parenthood. 
FDA data shows among the nearly 6 million cases of patients taking mifepristone, only one documented death has occurred due to taking too much of the medication.
Donohue said any inability of Planned Parenthood to meet these requirements is “self–imposed.”
Pai-Thompson countered that any restrictions are a big deal if they’re unconstitutional.
Missouri judge weighing whether new abortion ban should appear on 2026 ballot

Missouri has a long history of imposing “targeted regulation of abortion providers” laws.
These regulations played a large role in reducing the number of abortions in Missouri from more than 5,000 a decade ago to 167 in 2020, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
As the medication abortion regulations hearing played out in downtown Kansas City on Wednesday, the Missouri Court of Appeals was hearing arguments down the street in the Missouri attorney general’s attempt to overturn a preliminary injunction issued by Zhang allowing clinics across the state to resume procedural abortions for the first time in years.
The attorney general’s office is asking the appeals court to reverse that decision and again make procedural abortions inaccessible in Missouri.
The appeal was initially filed by Bailey, who recently resigned to become co-deputy director of the FBI. Catherine Hanaway, a former lawmaker and U.S. attorney, has taken his place.  
Gillian Wilcox, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri, said it’s yet to be seen if the change in leadership will change the office’s approach to the several abortion-related cases it’s involved in.
“At this point we expect the state to do everything in their power to have all of the restrictions on abortion care stay in place,” Wilcox said, “despite the amendment that the voters passed.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/planned-parenthood-2-e1707947543157.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)BECKLEY, W.Va. — A former West Virginia health officer testified Thursday that the state’s compulsory vaccination law, as it’s written without religious or philosophical exemptions, is the best way to protect the state’s public health goals. 
“At the end of the day, the… compulsory vaccine law actually is about creating healthy communities,” Dr. Cathy Slemp said. “It’s about protecting the health and safety of children, having a well vaccinated population so that we decrease disease spread and the occurrence of outbreaks.”
Slemp was West Virginia’s state health officer from 2002 to 2011 and again from 2018 through 2020. She testified Thursday during a hearing in Raleigh County Circuit Court. 
Circuit Judge Michael Froble is overseeing two consolidated lawsuits in a battle over the state’s school vaccination law and religious freedom. 
In one case, Miranda Guzman and other families are suing the West Virginia Board of Education and the Raleigh County Board of Education so that their children may attend school with a religious exemption for vaccines. The state school board has directed county boards not to accept religious exemptions. 
Froble in July issued a preliminary ruling allowing students in the case to attend class, but the ruling is limited to those students. The hearing Thursday was on a permanent injunction in the case. 
The other case is a lawsuit filed by Joshua Hess and Marisa Jackson, parents of immunocompromised children, who are suing the state Department of Health to stop it from issuing religious exemptions. The plaintiffs in that case are represented by the American Civil LIberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
All states require students attending school to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow students to opt out of the vaccination requirements because of philosophical or religious objections to the shots. 
In January, Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the state Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have established the exemptions in state code. 
As health officer, one part of Slemp’s job was to review appeals of decisions of the state immunization officer about medical vaccines exemptions.
Slemp said the state has gotten on average 50 applications for medical exemptions per year over the last seven years, about 80% of which are approved. 
By contrast, the state health department has gotten 570 applications for religious or philosophical exemptions for the 2025-2026 school year, Froble said. 
She said even small percentages of religious and philosophical exemptions increase disease. 
“They look like small numbers, but they are significant,” Slemp said. 
Slemp said states that allow religious exemptions see a “multifold” increase of vaccination exemptions overall, which can contribute to disease outbreaks. 
“So that does increase at a population level, the number of people that are unvaccinated, and that then therefore leads to increased risk of disease and outbreaks,” Slemp said. 
Non-medical exemptions also tend to be in clusters, compared to medical exemptions which are evenly distributed, Slemp said. Different diseases require different levels of vaccination for “herd immunity.” So some counties may have higher risk than others. 
Froble said Thursday that the state Department of Health has not said which of the 570 exemptions that have been sought are for religious versus philosophical reasons. 
The distinction is important, he said. 
Morrisey’s executive order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, which says that “no state action may burden a person’s exercise of freedom of religion, unless doing so is essential and is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.”
“If we are to really determine the application of the Equal Protection [for Religion Act], I believe the board is restricted only to consider religious exceptions, not philosophical exemptions,” he said. “They wouldn’t apply under the Equal Protection [for Religion Act.]”
Froble said part of the compelling state interest in the case is that if religious exemptions to the state school vaccination law are allowed, it may “open the floodgate” for people who don’t have religious beliefs but don’t like vaccines to get exemptions. 
“I believe the court is very concerned with trying to protect the religious beliefs of individuals, but also believes that is a very compelling interest by the state to make sure that we protect children in our school… I think that’s a paramount issue that we need to address in this case,” Froble said. 
Chris Weist, an attorney for families suing the state Board of Education, said he doesn’t know if the agency has a breakdown of philosophical and religious exemptions. 
“I want to be clear, we’ve never made a claim in this case that our particular plaintiffs are entitled to enforce the exemptions that they’ve gotten from the health department necessarily,” he said. “What we said is, ‘we’ve got an EPRA claim. Our clients have sincerely held religious beliefs. That triggers EPRA.’”
Weist said one of the reasons they haven’t asked for a statewide ruling is because determining whether the 570 exemptions are religious or philosophical reasons would be challenging. 
“I’ll be candid with the court, our team has discussed class wide relief, and that issue of, is it religious, or is it something else is a challenge to that,” Weist said. 
Holly Wilson, an attorney for the state Department of Health argued that there is no distinction between a religious and a philosophical exemption. 
“The West Virginia Supreme Court has already construed the term religious or religion for purposes of the First Amendment free exercise clause that religion encompasses philosophical objections,” she said. “These are one and the same… you can’t break these two things apart because they are the same.”
The judge gave counsel in the lawsuits two weeks to write briefs about religious versus philosophical exemptions. 
The hearing in the case is expected to continue.

Ned Lamont on Wednesday announced the creation of a new state office focused on eliminating barriers to behavioral health care in Connecticut and nominated Howard Sovronsky, a former social worker with leadership experience in both government and health care, as its inaugural head.
The Connecticut Office of the Behavioral Health Advocate will help residents access behavioral health services and help providers receive payments from insurers for the care they provide.
“Access to mental health services is one of the most pressing needs of our time, and it needs to be treated just as we do for any other physical health situation,” Lamont stated in a press release. “This new office will provide the residents of our state with an advocate to help break down the barriers that still stand in the way of true mental health equity.”
Most recently, Sovronsky served as chief behavioral health officer at Connecticut Children’s in Hartford, and he has more than 40 years of experience as a licensed clinical social worker. He also worked in Nassau County, Long Island’s local government for two decades, including a stint as the commissioner of the county’s Department of Mental Health and Development Disabilities. 
In his new role as the behavioral health advocate, Sovronsky wants to hear from people who receive behavioral health services about what improvements the system needs.
“The answers are out there. We have to be nimble enough and open enough to hear them,” Sovronsky told legislators during a confirmation hearing in March.
A national report published last year ranked Connecticut among the top 10 states for access to mental health care. Still, issues persist, particularly in the face of a “dramatic increase in demand” for services, Sovronsky told legislators.
“We should all be proud that Connecticut has one of the most highly developed behavioral health systems in the country,” he said. “Yet individuals and families continue to struggle, navigating a system that is fragmented and confusing.” 
Last year, the state Office of Health Strategy found that roughly 1.5 million residents lived in areas where the demand for mental health services exceeded the capacity of local providers. Statewide, adults earning low incomes reported feeling chronically depressed at five times the rate of those earning high incomes. Demand for mental health services for children, in particular, continues to climb. 
In his new role, Sovronsky will also help behavioral health providers receive timely payments from insurance carriers and advocate for greater access to behavioral health services.
In 2019, Connecticut passed a law requiring what’s known as “mental health parity,” meaning insurers cannot place greater restrictions on access to mental health services than on surgical or medical care. During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers added teeth to the measure, allowing the Insurance Commissioner to fine insurers up to $625,000 annually for noncompliance. 
During a hearing earlier this year, behavioral health providers testified that they often hear from patients who can’t access treatment they need because payers are less likely to provide adequate coverage for mental health services.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_8544-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

The monitor’s latest report, released Thursday, Sept. 11, shows about 7.33% of the state experiencing “extreme drought” conditions.
“Extreme drought occurs when conditions are dry enough to cause water shortages, particularly for agriculture and for residents who rely on well water,” said New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone in a Sept. 11 email to the Bulletin. Farmers in areas under this classification could see widespread crop loss, according to the National Weather Service.
The monitor relies on data tracking rainfall, stream flow, soil moisture content, reservoir levels, and more to draw its drought maps, according to the website. Extreme drought conditions are the third most extreme of four drought categories represented by the monitor. 
“This time of year, drought can enhance wildfire hazard and negatively impact fall foliage and crop health,” Stampone said. If the ground freezes before the drought ends, she added, it will become more difficult for the ground to “recharge” with groundwater — “essentially locking hydrologic drought in place through the cold season,” she said.
The state recommends mandatory water conservation measures during times of extreme drought, Stampone said, but whether to impose restrictions on water use is ultimately up to municipalities.
Across much of the rest of New Hampshire, a drought of lower classification is ongoing, with most of the northern half of the state experiencing “severe drought,” according to the monitor. Much of the rest of the state is experiencing moderate drought, leaving less than 10% of the state outside the drought conditions — although that area, which stretches between Rockingham and Hillsborough counties, is classified by the monitor as “abnormally dry.”
Despite a rainy spring and early summer, New Hampshire was plunged into drought conditions in a matter of weeks this summer. Stampone said in an interview with the Bulletin earlier in September that such a swing could become characteristic of the state’s changing climate, with rainy springs followed by the potential for hot, dry summers.
Though droughts have long been a reality in New Hampshire, they are becoming more intense with climate change, Stampone said then. The drought conditions have made for a challenging growing season for farmers across the state, who are contending with water scarcity they said has become a seasonal pattern.
And the speed with which the weather can swing from damp to dry makes it important to conserve water even when the need may not seem pressing, she added.
“When we do go into drought, we tend to go into it quickly,” she said. “Water conservation is something that should always be on our minds, even in times when we are wet.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nhdrought-1024x609.png,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

“This is an age of ideological turmoil, turmoil frequently manifested on our college campuses. The state of Florida and the UF administration and board leadership responded crisply to the post-Oct. 7 unrest. I will be locking in a culture of freedom of academic expression tempered by civility,” Landry said. 
Landry’s confirmation came one day after the shooting death of political commentator Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University.
Landry was announced as UF trustees’ choice for interim president on Aug. 25. He started the job Sept. 1, but his position was not finalized until BOG approval.
The university needed to find a new interim president after former President Kent Fuchs’ interim contract expired. The first search for a president after the resignation of former President Ben Sasse ended with the BOG rejecting Santa Ono, former president of the University of Michigan. That meant another search couldn’t be completed before Fuchs’ contract expired.
“It’s been said by people in the last few years, especially in the last year, that the state of Florida, because of what we’ve done, we won’t be able to attract great presidential candidates. And if you look around the room, I think we’ve got some of the best presidents in the country,” Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine said. 
Landry’s contract would pay him $2 million if he is not named UF’s formal president at the end of his interim stint.
UF trustees applying pressure to make interim leader permanent

The provision follows concerns that candidates might be scared to apply for the presidency if there was a chance they would end up jobless after quitting their previous job, like Ono did.
“We are excited to see what UF can accomplish under his leadership,” UF Board of Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini said of Landry. Hosseini previously called Ono’s rejection “deeply disappointing.”
Landry’s contract will provide him a base salary of $2 million with a $500,000 performance incentive.
As president, Sasse was paid a $1 million base salary in a contract worth $10 million over five years. Florida State University President Richard McCullough just received a raised base salary of $1.25 million for the last year of his five-year contract.
“UF is on the ascendant and I enthusiastically endorse and will tirelessly work to achieve this aspiration,” Landry said, noting that UF is “clearly in the top five, arguably the best.”
The Board of Governors concluded its two-day meeting on New College of Florida’s campus with Landry’s vote. 
The University of Florida has yet to announce a new presidential search committee.

The event was led by Michigan Energy, Michigan Jobs, which included speakers in state Reps. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) and Timmy Beson (R-Bangor Township), and state Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing).
“Today’s event showed the strength and unity of Michiganders who know that clean energy is the key to strengthening affordability, creating healthier communities, and building a stronger economy,” Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director for Climate and Energy at the Natural Resources Defence Council said. “Seeing people from all walks of life gather at the Capitol demonstrates the broad support for policies that keep energy affordable, reliable, and homegrown here in Michigan.”
Those who participated in the event highlighted the economic benefits of clean energy, and the negative health impacts brought by fossil fuels. 
“Protecting the health of Michigan families must be at the center of energy policy,” Dr. Lisa Del Buono, board chair of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action said. “As clinicians, we see how fossil fuel pollution drives asthma and respiratory illness, especially in children and seniors. By accelerating the shift to clean, reliable energy, lawmakers can help ensure every child grows up breathing cleaner air.”
Attendees also advocated for community solar, which would allow Michigan communities to lower their energy bills by subscribing to a local solar energy project.
“Community solar is one of the smartest ways Michigan can grow its clean energy economy,” Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director for Vote Solar said. “These projects keep investment and decision-making local, creating jobs, strengthening our farms and businesses, and helping families save on their electric bills. By expanding community solar, we can deliver both energy independence and economic opportunity to communities across the state.”

(NOAA archive photo)Federal legislation introduced jointly by U.S. Sens. Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, and Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, seeks to establish a fire weather program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The legislation passed the Senate unanimously on Sept. 10. 
“As a former aerial firefighter, one of my top priorities since taking office has been to reform our federal wildland firefighting apparatus to better protect our communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “The Fire Ready Nation Act ensures we can better predict these disasters and respond quickly to prevent the devastation to families, homes, and businesses that is caused by catastrophic wildfire.”
Fire weather describes certain conditions that lead to an elevated level of alert. Wind and humidity, for example, are two factors taken into account. Wildfire smoke is also tracked by federal agencies, and that information is then disseminated to the public. Many state agencies, including Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality, also track smoke impacts.
Earlier this year, Cantewell said more than 300,000 acres burned in Washington last year, and wildfires in California in January demonstrated the nation was facing “costly, unpredictable wildfires year-round.
“The Fire Ready Nation Act can help save homes and lives by giving scientists and weather forecasters on the front lines of wildfires innovative tools to better predict wildfire and smoke conditions,” Cantell said in a Jan. 30 press release.
The legislation is seeking to address a gap, a Cantwell release said.
“(NOAA) has no defined authority in law for its wildfire services. And while NOAA is a world leader in wildfire forecasting, better coordination and funding for new high-tech initiatives would help improve forecasting and preparedness,” the release stated.
The Department of Government Efficiency cut employees at the National Weather Service earlier this year, though the Trump administration has since sought to rehire them.
According to the bill text, program priorities include creating an improved fire-weather model that includes variables important for firefighters to know. It also asks the agency to implement artificial intelligence and cloud computing when creating the program. There’s also an ask for “a rapidly deployable network of rain gauges for post-fire hazard monitoring,” the bill states.
The hope is to update and upgrade weather models and make that information easily available to those that depend on it.
In addition, the bill would also “establish and maintain” an Incident Meteorologist Service within the National Weather Service. It appears they would be providing on-site support services during weather incidents that includes fires.
The bill also asks for various working groups to address issues, including communication between different agencies. It’s asking for an appropriation of $118 million over the next five years, according to the bill text.
Statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center say that more than 48,000 wildfire incidents have been reported year-to-date. Those fires have burned 4,320,279 acres across the country this year.
Fires have been a focus for Sheehy, with the Fire Ready Nation Act his second piece of fire legislation that’s passed the body unanimously. Prior to his Senate term, Sheehy co-founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting company that operates a fleet of water-scooping aircraft.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/5083386035_8a18a32373_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-11 20:20:27+00:00,CT Mirror,Western Mass. working to halt sewage flowing into CT,"Hallie Claflin, CommonWealth Beacon",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/11/western-mass-sewage-ct-river/,The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by sewer overflows that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.,"Reports of toilet paper, raw sewage, and other discarded items flowing through the Connecticut River in Suffield and Enfield went viral in recent weeks as Connecticut state Rep. Tami Zawistowski pointed the finger at Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee.  
“They all have issues that have emerged in recent years,” Zawistowski told WTNH News 8, claiming Holyoke alone “dumped” seven million gallons of sewage into the river in one day. “It’s time for Massachusetts to step up.” 
Officials in the cities that have been singled out say the “issues” that have emerged are intensifying rain events due to climate change.  
The pollution in the Connecticut River is caused by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that have long been an issue in older cities with aged infrastructure.  
Cities like Holyoke, Springfield, and Chicopee have historically combined sewer systems where both wastewater and stormwater come through shared pipes. During heavy rains, the excess flow bypasses the treatment plants where it is supposed to be cleaned and is instead discharged into local bodies of water to prevent backups in people’s homes.  
All three cities have made multi-million-dollar efforts in recent years to prevent overflows and have reached the final stages of separating their stormwater and sewer systems, significantly reducing their annual discharges. But as climate change continues to worsen heavy rain events, inevitable overflow events are working against their progress. 
Funding the expensive projects required to update the sewer systems is a daunting task, and the three Gateway Cities often lack the taxpayer base to pay for it.  
“By no means would I say that Chicopee, Holyoke, and Springfield have done nothing,” Springfield Water and Sewer Commission Executive Director Josh Schimmel said. “If we could wave a wand and make them go away tomorrow, we would, but we serve a disadvantaged population that pays for it.” 
Mary Monahan, interim director of Holyoke Public Works, said the city has already eliminated 70 percent of the overflows outlined in their legally binding performance improvement plan established with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Justice Department. Previous CSOs in Holyoke violated federal and state wastewater discharge permits, according to the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office. 
“On a normal day, we’re only using half the capacity of the plant,” Monahan said. “It’s only this rainfall that overwhelms it. Climate change is definitely exacerbating this issue.” 
Two projects amounting to $22.5 million are in the works now. River Terrace Phase A and B will continue the city’s efforts to separate the two systems and mitigate CSO events. Holyoke generally secures funding for CSO projects through the EPA’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which offers no interest loans.  
Last year, the city applied for a $19 million grant through the EPA’s Community Change Grants Program, a Biden-era initiative funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that provides funding to disadvantaged communities for environmental projects. While waiting in the queue to be funded, the program was cancelled in May by the EPA under the Trump administration.  
The grant was going to help fund a new centrifuge in Holyoke’s treatment plant, which removes liquid from the waste sludge and lowers disposal costs. It is expected to cost between $3 million and $4 million.  
“For a city like Holyoke, it really is a financial burden,” Monahan said. “Our ratepayers are paying almost $2 million a year in debt service, and River Terrace Phase B is going to add more.”  
The city is required to report the volume of discharge associated with CSOs each time there is a rain event. While Zawistowski was correct in claiming that seven million gallons had been discharged into the river in one day, Monahan estimates that nearly five million of that had already been treated in their plant. She says the city is working on revising how they report CSO volumes.  
“Ninety-nine percent of the overflow could be rainwater, which is technically clean, and 1 percent of it could be the sewage that was in the pipe,” Chicopee Water Pollution Control project supervisor Quinn Lonczak said. “It’s hard to know what is actually going out.”  
Monahan and Lonczak, along with city officials from Springfield, say they want to see the Connecticut River clean as much as anyone else does.  
“If it’s a regional rain event and all of the other plants are overflowing, sure, there’s going to be water quality issues and everything coming downstream,” Monahan said. “We’re really easy to pick on.”  
In Chicopee, between 80 and 85 percent of the city’s average annual discharge has been eliminated, according to Lonczak. Between 60 and 65 percent of their long-term CSO control plan projects have been completed. Since 2000, the city has spent close to $250 million on CSO-related projects. 
“It’s not an easy fix. It’s not a cheap fix. And it’s not something that we ignore,” Lonczak said. “We’ve done a lot of projects here, spent a lot of money, and nearly all of that money is local. Our ratepayers here are paying for those projects.”  
While making considerable progress, Lonczak anticipates that completing the targeted projects will cost another $100 million before inflation. Some parts of the system are still combined, but don’t discharge a significant amount. He said the challenge is that now the city is left with project areas that will cost a lot but will ultimately remove only a small amount of overflow.  
A Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection report released in May showed that 543 million gallons of wastewater overflowed into the Connecticut River last year across 12 days with weather events, compared to nearly one billion gallons in 2023.  
“There’s a plan, and it may not be going as fast as the state of Connecticut wants, unless somebody starts writing some checks,” Lonczak said. “If you wanted to eliminate CSOs in Chicopee in five years … is it possible? Anything’s possible, it’s just the dollar amount.” 
Nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995, according to the EPA.  
“We can handle regular rain. We’re going to get an inch and a half of rain over 12 hours? That’s no problem. We’re designed for that,” Lonczak said. “It’s short-duration, high-intensity events.”  
Springfield is less concerned with separating their sewer systems, according to Schimmel. Their CSO elimination projects involve a mix of separation in some areas, increased treatment plant capacity, and creating in-system storage. He says complete separation could solve one problem while creating another.  
“You can eliminate 100 percent of CSOs, and storm water alone is going to violate water quality standards every time it rains,” Schimmel said. “Although storm water is more dilute pollution by volume, it’s every bit as harmful as CSO. Separation reduces your combined sewer overflow, but it increases your stormwater.”  
Springfield has spent approximately $300 million on CSO projects, according to Schimmel, which have eliminated more than 50 percent of its CSOs in the last two decades.  
In the years following the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act, the construction of wastewater treatment plants was largely paid for by the federal government through grants. Local entities paid a small portion of the cost. Municipalities must now pick up most of the cost, while state and federal agencies finance small, if any portions of their projects, Schimmel added. 
“There’s never been free money since the 70s and early 80s for any of us to do CSO work,” he said. “The pendulum has swung completely to the other side. It needs to come back to the middle to some degree.”  
He takes issue with river alliance and environmental advocacy groups referring to the city as “polluters.”  
“How about you put all of that effort into advocating your state legislators to get us money to fix the problem?” Schimmel said.

A small but pensive crowd gathered together Thursday morning at the Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Exeter to observe the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.
People silently entered the Wall of Honor, which is in the center portion of the cemetery, via a walkway flanked on each side by members of the Rhode Island Patriot Guard Riders standing at attention, holding flags. 
Debbie Kane of The Rhode Island Highlanders played the bagpipes before the speaking program began. 
Among those who delivered remarks was Lt. Col. Andrew C. Cairns, professor of the University of Rhode Island’s ROTC program, who shared his memory of watching the clear blue sky fill with smoke across the New York skyline from his high school classroom in New Jersey.
Other speakers were The Rev. William Reynolds of the Beacon Church in Exeter; Paul Murgo, administrator of the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol, and George Lieb of the Exeter #1 Volunteer Fire Department. 
Sen. Leonidas P. Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, presented a proclamation to William Pennoyer of the American Legion. The proclamation states that new legislation passed this year by the General Assembly allows teachers or administrators in Rhode Island public schools to hold a brief moment of silence after the pledge of allegiance on the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001. The new law, ceremonially signed Thursday afternoon by Gov. Dan McKee, was modeled on a measure enacted in New York to commemorate the attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon.
Followed by the bugle call of the Rhode Island Funeral Honors Team playing “To The Colors.”
The ceremony continued with the laying of a memorial wreath, the reading of the names of the Rhode Islanders lost in the attacks, and the “Striking of the Four Fives” — a ceremonial ringing of five bell strikes repeated in four series, a tradition that signifies the death of a firefighter in the line of duty.
Exeter Town Council Vice President Ray Morrisfield gave the crowd a few words to contemplate before the ceremony ended with a rifle volley by the Rhode Island Funeral Honors Team, standing high upon a hill.
“Up to 9/11, we would say let the dead rest in peace, but today let us say, let the living live in peace,” Morrisfield said.

(Photo by Brandon O’Connor, NRCS/USDA )The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it had improved and expanded its Farm to School Grant program and would invest up to $18 million to connect locally grown food to child nutrition programs. 
The Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants program was initiated in 2013, but according to a news release, the fiscal year 2026 investment represents the “largest total amount” the department has offered in a given year. 
The Farm to School Grant announcement was made alongside U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s latest Make America Healthy Again report, which called for more whole, unprocessed foods in children’s diets.

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the grants are “one of the best ways we can deliver nutritious, high-quality meals to children, while also strengthening local agriculture.” 
“These grants will open new doors for small family farms, expand access to healthy food in schools, and inspire the next generation of Great American Farmers,” Rollins said in the news release. 
State agencies, tribal organizations, child nutrition programs, nonprofits, agricultural producers and groups of producers can apply for grants from $100,000 to $500,000 to support new and existing farm to school projects, according to the grant website. 
Eligible projects are those that: incorporate more unprocessed and locally produced foods in school meals, encourage the consumption of fresh foods, train producers on food safety and procurement requirements or educate students on agriculture and nutrition.
The release from USDA said updates to the program will also streamline the application process, remove barriers to innovation and emphasize partnerships.
“Under President Trump’s leadership, USDA is proud to streamline this program, so it works better for families, farmers, and communities across our nation,” Rollins said in the release. “Putting America’s Farmers First starts with putting our children first.”
According to USDA’s latest Farm to School Census, more than 440 Iowa school food authorities, the entities that manage school food service, have participated in the program.
The grants can also be used to support agriculture education at schools through things like ag and nutrition classes, or school gardening programs. According to the census, nearly 50% of Iowa school food authorities had classroom programs and slightly more than 15% of Iowa school food authorities had edible gardens. 
According to USDA, Farm to School Grant awards totaled $100 million since 2013. 
The millions in Farm to School Grant dollars are significantly less than the billions of dollars that schools and food banks used under a pandemic-era program to support local food purchases. 
These programs, Local Food for Schools and Local Food Purchase Assistance, were canceled in March after USDA announced in October 2024 over a $1 billion in funds to continue the programs across the country. 
Tommy Hexter, the policy director for Iowa Farmers Union, said the new investment from USDA is positive, but said it doesn’t make up for the loss of programs that provided “vital government support” to food farmers and players in the local food system.
Hexter said the canceled programs created relationships between farmers, food hubs, the state department of agriculture, schools and community, that are “fundamental to our food system in Iowa.”
“The first and foremost thing with this announcement is like, yes, let’s see how we can take advantage of this new announcement and make these programs come to Iowa,” Hexter said. “But we also are acknowledging that this investment does not replace the major loss of funding that happened earlier this year.”

From January through August, Arkansans bought $193.1 million in medical marijuana products from the state’s dispensaries, compared with $182.5 million in the same period last year, according to a press release from the state Department of Finance and Administration.
“With daily sales averaging about $800,000 in 2025, we are on track to surpass the 2023 sales record of $283 million,” department spokesperson Scott Hardin said.
There has also been a significant year-to-year increase in the number of pounds of cannabis sold, Hardin said, with the 2025 total at 52,292 pounds.
The state collected $5.38 million in tax revenue from medical marijuana in July and August, bringing the total tax haul so far this year to $21.57 million.
Patients spent $24,262,201 in July, purchasing 6,721 pounds, and $24,647,170 in August, buying 6,778 pounds, according to the finance department.
Suite 443 in Hot Springs and Natural Relief Dispensary in Sherwood sold the most medical marijuana in both July and August, according to the press release. Suite 443 sold 1,419.6 pounds total for both months. Natural Relief sold 1,317.7 pounds over July and August.
“A total of $1.5 billion has been spent on medical marijuana since the state’s first dispensary opened in May 2019,” Hardin said.
The Arkansas Department of Health reports 109,060 active patient cards. The Medical Marijuana Commission has licensed 38 dispensaries but only 36 are operating, Hardin said. The license of one of the closed dispensaries was revoked by the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board last year, and its owner’s appeal of the revocation remains before the courts.

Restoring Every Aspect of Life begins with hope and someone by
your side while you take the first step.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Recovery is REAL in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom.","Every September, communities and care providers across the nation,including in the Northeast Kingdom (NEK) of Vermont, recognize NationalRecovery Month, a time to celebrate the millions of Americans who are inrecovery from mental health and/or substance use disorders—and torecommit to breaking down barriers to treatment.
This year’s theme, Recovery is REAL (Restoring Every Aspect of Life),highlights the truth that recovery goes far beyond abstinence. It’s aboutrestoring health, a sense of purpose and overall wellbeing. But achievingthese goals often depends on one critical factor: access to recovery services.
Why Integrating Recovery Services into Primary Care MattersRecovery begins with hope and the conviction that healing and change arepossible. Building on an individual’s strengths, readiness, and availableresources; recovery is a holistic process that extends beyond symptommanagement to encompass the whole person.
For nearly 20 years, Northern Counties Health Care (NCHC) has embracedholistic, patient-centered care through the integration of mental health andsubstance use (behavioral health) services within their Primary Carepractices throughout Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. Because of this,NCHC’s Primary Care practices provide not only a medical entry point, butalso a cornerstone of recovery. NCHC’s Primary Care providers are often thefirst and most consistent point of contact, ensuring whole-person care thatintegrates physical health, mental health, social health, and substance usesupport.
“I have heard for years, and from many patients, that it is reassuring toknow that we see them and care for them as entire beings, and not just aspatients with substance use disorder. And that it makes it comfortable andconvenient to receive all services in one place,” says Jeri Wohlberg, FamilyNurse Practitioner at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC’s AssistantMedical Director.
Jeri Wohlberg, Family Nurse Practitioner at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC’s Assistant Medical Director; and Brook
Marcotte, RN at Hardwick Area Health Center and NCHC MOUD Program Coordinator discussing recovery with a patient.
“This program and the ones (who) run it, saved my life. I’ve never felt socomfortable with a medical team before,” said a patient in recovery fromsubstance use disorder (SUD) with NCHC’s Hardwick Area Health Center.
Substance Use Disorder (SUD)A substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic but treatable medical condition.It occurs when someone continues using alcohol, drugs, or other substancesdespite harmful effects on their health, relationships, or daily life.
In 2022, more than 1 in 6 Americans aged 12 and older reported having aSUD. SUDs can range from mild to severe and can affect anyone, regardlessof race, gender, income, or background.
Substances linked to SUDs include:

 Alcohol
 Cannabis
 Hallucinogens
 Inhalants
 Opioids (prescription and illicit)
 Sedatives, hypnotics, or anti-anxiety drugs
 Stimulants (like cocaine or methamphetamine)
 Tobacco/nicotine

Substance use disorders can happen to anyone. Some people begin usingsubstances to cope with trauma, stress, or mental health conditions. Othersdevelop SUD after being prescribed opioids for pain. Over time, substanceuse can change the brain, creating strong cravings that drive continued use.
Treatment and RecoveryRecovery looks different for every person – there is no single “right way.” Forsome, recovery may include counseling, medical treatment including medication, or peer groups; for others, it may involve faith, family support, or self-care practices. Often, it’s a combination.
Because SUD is complex and requires a personalized approach, NCHCPrimary Care teams provide a variety of options for patients including accessto compassionate and specialized staff to address many key components ofrecovery:

Behavioral health care and counseling staff, including psychiatry, forsupport with related mental health needs, understanding triggers andbuilding coping skills, and encouraging patient participation inmeaningful daily activities—like work, school, caring for loved ones,volunteering, or exploring creative outlets.
Community Health Workers and Peer Support Workers to connectpatients and families to community resources (housing, food,transportation), facilitate access to social services, self-managementprograms and peer support groups, and provide guidance andencouragement.
Licensed medical Primary Care providers (Doctors, Nurse Practitioners,Physician Assistants) to maintain a schedule of ongoing checkups andtreatment. Many are trained to prescribe medications that reducecravings or ease withdrawal like those used for Medication for OpioidUse Disorder (MOUD) (formerly known as Mediation AssistedTreatment or MAT), or to provide referrals to specialized care when itisn’t available right in the practice.
MOUD specialists to coordinate medical care, use of medications,counseling and behavioral therapies, and support services to provide awhole-patient approach to the treatment of opioid use disorder.

Reducing StigmaPeople with SUDs often struggle to stop using substances, even when theyunderstand the risks, and even when services like those at NCHC PrimaryCare practices are available. Overcoming SUD almost always requires morethan “willpower.”
Addiction stigma, the negative and unfair belief that those who developSUDs are morally weak and that they should “just quit,” often keeps peoplefrom seeking help. Over time, stigma may become internalized and leadpeople to believe that they are of lesser value or unworthy of help becausethey can’t tackle SUD on their own.
Understanding SUD as a health condition—and not a personal failure—canmake it easier for individuals and families to access life-saving treatmentand long-term recovery. This understanding and compassionateenvironment is one that NCHC Primary Care practices seek to cultivate.
“The research shows us that the biggest reason people don’t reach out forhelp with substance use is stigma, and anecdotally, this is what I hear frompatients. It is both heart-breaking and affirming when patients say, ‘I wish I’ddone this 20 years ago.’ We still have a long way to go, but when I hear that,I know that we have provided a safe space where people feel heard andsupported –and I know we’re on the right track,” says Brook Marcotte, RN atHardwick Area Health Center and NCHC MOUD Program Coordinator.
When this type of care is available, recovery is not only possible—it ishappening every day. “My MAT RN is amazing and is so helpful and kind,and I believe she actually cares about my recovery. She is always advocatingfor me, listens to me and helps me in any way that I need,” says a patient atNCHC’s Hardwick Area Health Center.

(Photo: NCGA livestream) Senate President Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall held a rare joint press conference Thursday to announce plans to bring forth a comprehensive package in September to address violent crimes. The two legislative leaders connected the August 22 murder of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail system with Wednesday’s assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University.
“I’ll start by acknowledging today being September 11th and the tragic time in our country 24 years ago,” said Hall. “Unfortunately, as we stand here today, another tragic time in our country with the murder of Charlie Kirk yesterday, and for us here in North Carolina coming on the heels of a tragedy on the Charlotte transit system with the murder of the Ukrainian refugee.”
Hall said while they are still in the “homework stage” of determining what happened in Zarutska’s case, it was clear to him that it was largely the result of the judicial magistrate allowing the suspect, a repeat offender, to walk out of jail on the promise to reappear in court at a future date.
Michael Whatley, the Republicans’ presumptive candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina in 2026, joined the press conference to honor Kirk’s legacy and find fault with former Gov. Roy Cooper, the Democratic candidate for Senate seat.
“There is a crime crisis here in North Carolina and across the country brought about by the left’s soft on crime policies. Roy Cooper has a history of being soft on crime,” said Whatley.
The former chair of the Republican National Committee said leaders in Democratic Party need to call out hateful rhetoric that is leading to violence.
Both Whatley and Berger pointed to the Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice (TREC), formed in 2020 by then-Gov. Cooper to address systemic racial bias in the criminal justice system.
Berger said that Zarutska’s life was tragically cut short because of the “atrocious policies pushed by out of touch politicians and court officials” that prioritize a “perverted vision” of equity and social justice.
TREC was tasked with submitting an annual report with legislative and municipal recommendations. It would be up to North Carolina’s legislature to decide which of those policies to advance.
But Berger said such recommendations could be problematic.
“What they do is they reflect an attitude on policing, an attitude on how things ought to be taking place,  and those attitudes in many respects are the things that inform the kinds of decisions that were made by the magistrate in this case,” said Berger.
Restarting the death penalty 
When the House and Senate return on September 22nd, Republican leadership will propose a package of policies to address crime.
“We can start by ensuring that Governor Stein and other members of the executive branch cannot establish any future task forces like the one Roy Cooper created that advanced weak-on-crime policies that kept Iryna’s murderer on the streets,” said Berger.
Berger also pledged to personally look for ways to restart North Carolina’s death penalty.
“Republicans in the General Assembly have attempted to restart the death penalty over the past decade and a half but those efforts have been stymied at every turn,” said the Senate leader.
There has been a de-facto moratorium on the death penalty in North Carolina for almost 20 years. President Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday that the suspect in the Charlotte case should be given a quick trial and the death penalty.
“There can be no other option,” Trump wrote.

Berger said legislators would also work to end cashless bail and keep repeat offenders in jail.
Speaker Hall said the forthcoming legislation would include more oversight of magistrates.
“Looking at the way that we select magistrates, making sure that the folks who are making these decisions are paying attention to what they’re doing and that they’re trying to serve public safety, not some left-wing interest,” Hall said.
Hall said the legislature would also examine the budgets of both Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to determine if any outside grants may have influenced magistrates to oppose cash bail. Advocate for bail reform have argued previously that cash bail disproportionately impacts the poor.
“Ultimately, we’re dealing with two local governments that in my opinion have lost institutional control of their areas,” said Hall.
Neither Berger nor Hall suggested that the new legislative package would include gun control.
“You know the murderer in Charlotte killed this young lady with a knife. A gun had nothing to do with it,” Hall told reporters. “Again, it’s a problem of local officials being soft on crime.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Speaker-Hall-09112025a-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-11 16:58:23.496437

North Dakota and 11 other states are advocating for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the arguments of North Dakota ranchers in a dispute with an energy company.
WBI Energy used eminent domain to take a portion of the northwest North Dakota landowners’ property for a pipeline project in 2018. The ranchers were compensated for their land under a confidential settlement with WBI in 2021, though the parties disagreed as to whether the group was also entitled to legal fees.
A North Dakota federal judge initially ordered WBI to pay the landowners about $380,000 in legal expenses, though the 8th Circuit Court of Appeal overturned that decision earlier this year.
WBI to receive $500M state financial guarantee to build natural gas pipeline in North Dakota

In early August, the landowners filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the appellate court’s decision. They ultimately want the high court to reverse the circuit court’s ruling.
Twelve Republican-led states in a Monday friend-of-the-court brief took the landowners’ side.
Bob McNamara, the lead attorney representing the McKenzie County property owners, said it’s “remarkable” to see so many states come together in support of the ranchers’ petition.
The dispute centers on whether the parties have to follow federal or state law.
WBI took the ranchers’ land under a federal law called the Natural Gas Act, which allows private businesses to use the federal government’s eminent domain power for public natural gas infrastructure. While the landowners were paid for their land, the act doesn’t say whether that sum must also include landowners’ legal expenses.
Both the plaintiffs and the 12-state coalition that filed Monday’s brief take the stance that when federal law is silent, state property law governs.
Under North Dakota law, WBI is required to pay their attorney fees, the ranchers say.
WBI and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals disagree. The 8th Circuit in its ruling said that because  WBI wielded the federal government’s eminent domain power when it took the land, state law does not apply. When the federal government exercises eminent domain, it doesn’t have to cover property owners’ legal costs.
Allowing the appellate court’s ruling to stand would upset the balance of power between states and the federal government, the states argue in their Monday filing.
“Under the Eighth Circuit’s decision, landowners in seven states no longer have the benefit of state law property rights that landowners in the rest of the country have,” the brief says.
North Dakota landowners want to bring eminent domain case to US Supreme Court

The states expressed concern that the 8th Circuit’s legal interpretation could allow the federal government to quietly assume more regulatory authority over property-related matters.
WBI has to file a response to the landowners’ petition sometime in October, McNamara said. WBI declined a request for comment Thursday.
The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to consider the petition sometime in November, he added.
It’s extremely rare for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to review a case, though the justices have shown an interest in eminent domain and property rights issues, McNamara said previously. 
He said the states’ brief could help put the case on the high court’s radar.
“The court listens to states when they say, ‘This creates a big federalism problem,’” McNamara said.
The 11 states that signed onto the brief with North Dakota are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)While union membership dips nationally, a new report by the Illinois Economic Policy Institute and Project for Middle Class Renewal at the University of Illinois says two states that have strengthened laws on collective bargaining rights in recent years are seeing union membership increase.
In 2022, Illinois voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting bargaining rights. Illinois reported its first non-pandemic increase in unionization since 2017, with 27,000 union members added in 2024, according to the report.
Michigan repealed its “right-to-work” law in 2023, and gained 15,000 members in 2024 after years of union membership decline, the report shows. Michigan’s action was the first reversal of a state “right-to-work” law in decades, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. With the change, unionized workplaces can now require union dues or fees as a condition of employment. 
As a key labor union pushes into the South, red states push back

States have been active in recent years when it comes to determining the balance of bargaining rights between workers and employers.
In February, Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a ban on collective bargaining for public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, firefighters and transit workers. The law is considered among the most restrictive in the country. 
Labor advocates have since collected enough signatures to put a voter referendum on Utah’s 2026 ballot that could overturn the ban. 
In Wisconsin, a county judge ruled last December that a 2011 Republican-backed law banning collective bargaining for most public employees violated the state’s constitution. His decision is being appealed before the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.
Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington state this year expanded bargaining rights for agricultural cannabis workers and ferry workers and corrections workers. Maryland enacted a locally supported law giving bargaining rights to sheriff’s deputies in Calvert County, southeast of Washington, D.C..
Bills that would have expanded bargaining rights for public-sector workers in Nevada and Virginia were vetoed by Republican governors.
Adjusting for occupation, geography, education and demographics, union membership offered an average 8.5% boost in wages in the United States between 2022 and 2024, the report found.
Twenty-six states now have “right-to-work” laws, in which employees at a unionized workplace are not required to pay union dues even if they’re covered by the bargaining agreement. The Illinois researchers say such laws, along with a 2018 Supreme Court ruling barring mandatory union fees for public employees, are major drivers of declining union membership nationally.

Free.,Trump commemorates Charlie Kirk alongside 9/11 victims,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-commemorates-charlie-kirk-alongside-9/11-victims,,"WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump honored slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as he remembered the victims of Sept. 11 during a ceremony Thursday in Virginia, and announced he would posthumously award the popular figure the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Kirk, the late co-founder and head of the political advocacy organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking on a college campus in Utah.Trump described the attack as a “heinous assassination” and told a crowd gathered at the Pentagon that Kirk, 31, was “a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty and an inspiration to millions and millions of people.”“We miss him greatly. Yet I have no doubt that Charlie's voice and the courage he put into the hearts of countless people, especially young people, will live on,” Trump said.Trump said the ceremony to posthumously award Kirk the highest civilian honor has not yet been scheduled but that he expects “a very big crowd.”In recalling the deadliest attack on the United States, Trump said the “entire world came crashing down” for loved ones of the 2,977 victims.“In the quarter of a century since those acts of mass murder, 9/11 family members have felt the weight of missed birthdays and empty bedrooms, journals left unfinished and dreams left unfulfilled,” Trump said. “To every member that still feels a void every day of your lives, the First Lady and I unite with you in sorrow and today, as one nation, we renew our sacred vow that we will never forget September 11, 2001.”The president delivered remarks following Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who praised Kirk as a “good and faithful servant.” Hegseth said when faced with the tragic memory of 9/11 he finds hope in the “future of our great nation,” and invoked Kirk.“The young soldiers who take the oath give me hope. The young cops who wear the badge give me hope. The young firefighters who answer the call give me hope. The young agents who patrol our border give me hope. The life, example, and even death of Christ-follower and American patriot Charlie Kirk give me hope, sheer courage, no matter the arena,” Hegseth said.Vance in UtahVice President J.D. Vance, who had been scheduled to attend the 24th observance of 9/11 at Ground Zero in New York City, changed his travel plans to visit with Kirk’s family in Utah and fly with his casket to Arizona on Air Force Two, according to multiple media reports.Trump did not cancel a scheduled visit to a New York Yankees game Thursday night as part of a 9/11 commemoration.Vance issued a lengthy statement on social media Wednesday night sharing the story of his friendship with Kirk, including an acknowledgement they were both skeptical of Trump in 2016 before joining the president’s political agenda.“So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene. He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government,” Vance wrote.Kirk’s advocacy organization worked with Trump’s 2024 campaign to mobilize young voters in the November election.On Wednesday, Kirk was on the first of a 15-stop “American Comeback Tour” that was scheduled next week for events at Colorado State University.The zealous political figure was known for his outreach and events on college campuses. According to Turning Point USA, the organization has started over 1,000 chapters in high schools and 800 on college campuses across the U.S.Political violence Kirk’s killing is the latest in a string of politically motivated violence in recent years. A man fatally shot former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband in June. The alleged gunman, Vance Boelter, also shot and injured Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter had in his possession several weapons and a list of several Minnesota and federal lawmakers, including some of their home addresses, according to authorities.During last year’s presidential campaign, a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate Trump during an event in Pennsylvania. Just over two months later, another man attempted to shoot Trump at his golf course in Florida.In 2022, a man wielding a hammer and zip ties broke into then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and fractured the skull of Paul Pelosi, the Democratic leader’s husband.On Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of people stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. At least seven people died during or shortly after the attack and approximately 140 police officers were injured by the rioters.",,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s State Planning Council on Thursday approved a $10 billion blueprint for the next decade of transportation projects, even as questions linger over the availability of federal funding and the state’s ability to meet its own climate goals.
State officials must meet a Sept. 30 deadline to adopt the latest State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and send it to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for final approval or risk losing funding for future construction and rehabilitation projects.
“If y’all don’t approve this, starting Oct. 1, I can no longer approve reimbursements in Rhode Island,” warned Derek Torrey, Rhode Island administrator for the federal agency who sits on the council in an ex-officio role.
The State Planning Council is tasked by federal law with adopting a new STIP at least every four years. The STIP must present a four-year program, by year. Future projects are considered for informational purposes by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The project pipeline approved during the meeting held at the Department of Administration covers hundreds of projects for federal fiscal years 2026-2035, with 76% of capital spending being allocated toward the state’s roads and bridges. Notable projects include adding new lanes through the section of I-295 known as the “Cranston Canyon,” reconfiguring ramps near the state offices exit in Providence, and completing reconstruction of the new Route 6/10 interchange.
Even the rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge got listed as one of the notable line items in the draft STIP.
But just how many of those projects will remain fully funded over the course of the blueprint is unclear as spending authorized under the Biden-era Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is scheduled to sunset at the end of September 2026.
“We don’t know what comes next,” Torrey said. “We would all, I think, love it if the next transportation bill gives us more money, but we can’t plan for it. I certainly hope it comes in that direction.”
Meredith Brady, the council’s secretary and an associate director at the state’s Division of Planning, said she’s optimistic that Congress will reauthorize spending, despite “a new set of priorities coming out of Washington.”
“In the past when we’ve had a lot of political conflict, we’ve also had some extensions of the transportation authorization bill as it stands,” Brady said.

Short on state climate goals?
The STIP was approved by the council 19-1, with GrowSmart RI Executive Director Scott Wolf being the sole dissent.
Wolf commended the state for including “excellent individual projects” such as plans to replace bridges at Westerly’s Amtrak station starting in federal fiscal year 2029. But he called the overall project pipeline a “status quo roadmap” for Rhode Island’s future transportation priorities, noting that spending toward mass transit and bike infrastructure represents 12% of spending in the latest STIP.
“We need to move in a more transit and bike and ped-friendly direction,” Wolf said. “We need to reverse this serious underinvestment in non car-centric transportation projects.”
The Division of Planning first made the draft plan public in late June and then held two public hearings in North Kingstown and Providence along with two virtual sessions to gather feedback by July 30. Members of the public could also submit written comments online. Comments were compiled in a 255-page hearing report, many calling for greater investment in other modes of transportation.
“The advantages of alternative transit are well documented, including wellness, fitness, emotional health, reduced transit costs for riders, and reduced carbon emissions,” wrote Rep. Michelle McGaw, a Portsmouth Democrat.
Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat who sat in the audience of about a dozen people, most of them state employees, expressed concern that the lack of investment in alternative modes of transportation will hinder the state in meeting its Act on Climate goals. 
That’s the law passed in 2021 requiring the state to develop a plan to reduce all climate emissions from transportation, buildings and heating, and electricity to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, 80% below 1990 levels by 2040, and net-zero by 2050.
“If we’re not meeting those mandated benchmarks, we’re, as a state, liable,” she told the council. “People can sue us.”
The law allows citizens or organizations that believe the state is not upholding its responsibilities under the legislation to file suit in Rhode Island Superior Court starting in 2026.
Tasked with defending those lawsuits would be the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General. But Attorney General Peter Neronha hasn’t signed off on the latest project blueprint, according to a July 30 letter he sent to the council.
“As currently drafted, the STIP fails to take a forward-looking approach to achieving the State’s long-term goals, and falls far short of meaningfully furthering compliance with the Act on Climate,” Neronha wrote.
Brady said it’s not up to council to set policy.
“We’re just slotting the funding that we have into specific projects,” she said in an interview after the meeting. “And there are a lot of projects in the outyears that have the potential to positively impact our mode shift.”
Wolf wanted the council to amend the STIP to allow for additional investments but his suggestion was quickly rejected by other members of the panel after Brady stressed the need to get the STIP approved by the Federal Highway Administration before its Sept. 30 deadline. 
“First and foremost, we need to take action today,” she said.
Changes could always be made in the future, though they will require some sort of trade-off, Brady added.
“If you add a project, you need to remove a project or at least remove money from somewhere,” she said. “We can’t drop fiscal constraint.”

Kirk’s suspected killer remains at large and the manhunt continued on Thursday, with law enforcement announcing that they may have found the murder weapon – a high-powered, bolt-action rifle – in a wooded area where the shooter had fled. The FBI in Salt Lake City released two photos of a potential person of interest and asked for tips in helping apprehend the person.
After the shooting on Wednesday afternoon, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shared on social media that she was thinking of Kirk, his family and members of the community at Utah Valley University, where Kirk was killed. 
Before news of Kirk’s death, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) offered prayers for Kirk, his family and the students at Utah Valley University, emphasizing that political violence “has no place in our democracy.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) shared an article about Kirk’s death and stated “Political violence should be condemned by all decent people, no matter what your political leanings might be.”
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) also called for a stoppage in American political violence, calling it “wrong, anywhere, at any time, no matter what.

“This is horrifying. It’s tearing our country apart,” Dingell said.
U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) said in a social media post that “the political violence in this country has got to stop.”
In the same vein, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is running for U.S. Senate, said: “We all can have political disagreements, but violence is horrific and unacceptable.”
Calls for prayers, support for Kirk’s family abound
Following news of Kirk’s passing, several Michigan Republicans offered words in memorial of the 31-year old Turning Point USA founder.
U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) said Kirk “articulated conservative views to younger generations clearer than anyone.” 
“Solving political differences through violence has no place in our Nation, and these instances are becoming far too frequent. We must do better,” Bergman said. “Those of us who value free speech and conservative values vow to carry Charlie’s torch and pass it on for generations to come.”
Utah and federal law enforcement have yet to identify the shooter and their motive, but U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) said Kirk was martyred for his Christian conservative values. 
“Charlie was faithful even unto death – obedient to his convictions, bold in his witness, and steadfast in proclaiming the truth,” James said in a post to social media.
Michigan leaders warn of normalizing political violence
Alongside the state’s congressional delegation, several other Michigan leaders and candidates for office shared their thoughts on Kirk’s death. 
In a statement, Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist said Wednesday’s shooting is another reminder that gun violence and politically-motivated violence, cannot be tolerated.
No matter who you voted for, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said there is no justification of violence of any kind. 
Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University, search for shooter continues

Michigan Republican Party Chair and State Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) said he and his wife were devastated to hear of Kirk’s death, praising his work with conservative student activists on college campuses. 
“The wave of political violence gripping our nation is un-American, and unpatriotic,” Runestad said. “No American should fear for their life because of their faith or their political views. I hope everyone in Michigan will join me in continuing to pray for Charlie’s family and the profound impact he had on our nation.”
Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) issued a statement mourning Kirk’s death. 
“Charlie always emphasized that the minute we stop having discourse, the second we stop sharing ideas with each other, despite our differences, is when we will devolve into violence,” Nesbitt said.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is also running for U.S. Senate, said, “Even if we virulently disagree, we stand for free speech, and nowhere should free debate be more encouraged or protected than college campuses.”
Former Wayne County Health Director and Democratic U.S. Senate Candidate Abdul El-Sayed said that Kirk was practicing his right to free speech when he was shot. 
“Whatever our differences, we handle political disagreements with words and not violence in this country,” El-Sayed wrote in a post to social media. “That is the essence of what democracy is about.”
College political groups unify to condemn Kirk’s killing
Michigan College Democrats and Michigan College Republicans also issued a joint statement condemning the shooting. 
“Violence in any form has no space on our college campuses, end of story,” said Stella Camerlengo, president of the Michigan College Democrats. “As a generation, we have seen political violence plague Michigan and states across the country far too often. While our organizations may disagree on a lot, we can both come together to say that we vehemently refuse to accept a future where violence substitutes for dialogue.”
The two groups pointed to Wednesday’s shooting as a symptom of growing polarization in American politics, calling for disagreements to be sorted through loving, rational and good-faith debate.
“Terrorism has no place in American politics no matter what despicable way it manifests, and we will not be swayed.,” said Tyler Campbell, chair of the Michigan College Republicans. “We call all in our generation to sincerely learn from this tragedy, that we may preserve a united America.”

(Photo by Edwin J. Torres/Governor’s Office)Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law Thursday that establishes a new cabinet-level New Jersey Department of Veterans Affairs, separating housing, health care, and other benefits for veterans and their families from an existing state department that also handled military readiness and National Guard operations.
The move comes after state officials paid millions to settle lawsuits over hundreds of pandemic deaths in state-run veterans homes. The deaths prompted both federal and state investigations, which led the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney’s Office to order reforms and expanded oversight for care they deemed so abysmal that it violated residents’ constitutional rights.
The law, which is set to take effect in 120 days, reorganizes the existing Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two entities — the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Military Affairs.
Murphy plans to nominate Vincent Solomeno, now a deputy commissioner in the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and a former superintendent of the National Guard Training Center in Sea Girt, to be commissioner of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Brigadier General Yvonne L. Mays, the adjutant general of New Jersey and commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, will remain commissioner of the Department of Military Affairs.
Sens. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex County) was a chief sponsor of the law.
“Veterans need to know their voices are being heard and their needs prioritized. This bill reflects that commitment by giving them a dedicated seat at the table and a department that works only for them,” Vitale said in a statement.

(Getty Images)  LEXINGTON — The University of Kentucky has fired a tenured faculty member who formerly oversaw the university’s equine drug-testing lab. 
Scott Stanley was removed as the head of UK’s former Equine Analytical Chemistry Laboratory last year following an investigation that alleged the lab failed to meet standards under his leadership. The investigation was conducted by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, which oversees drug testing of Thoroughbred racehorses.
The UK Board of Trustees approved revoking Stanley’s tenure by voice vote during a Thursday special meeting. Trustees asked questions of Stanley’s attorney, Cristina Keith, and UK lawyer Whitney Stepp-Gay and publicly debated the decision. Stanley had waived his right to a hearing.
“At the University of Kentucky, we are committed to advancing Kentucky through research and service of the highest quality,” said board Chair Britt Brockman in a statement following the meeting. “We must uphold the highest ethical standards and comply fully with university and industry regulations. Any violations of these policies are taken seriously and addressed to maintain the integrity of this work – the work of thousands of people across this institution.”
Keith told the Lantern after the board vote that her client was obviously disappointed with the outcome, but she could not say if Stanley would appeal the decision in court without speaking to him first. 
A university press release said that terminating a tenured faculty member is rare, but allowed under Kentucky state law. 
UK began the process to revoke Stanley’s tenure last fall after initial findings in an internal audit. One finding included a test that was commissioned by the Horseracing Integrity and Welfare Unit was never performed but Stanley had reported the result. 
Keith said in the board meeting in response to questions about the testing result that “without additional information, Dr Stanley cannot speak to this specific allegation” and questioned the integrity of the finding. She said there has not been a photograph of the alleged unopened sample. 
“In addition to that, all samples are received in more than one vial, so assuming that there was a discovery of one unopened vial in the EACL lab refrigerator, that is not conclusive evidence that no testing had been performed,” she said. 
Charges Stanley faced, according to UK’s press release, were: 

Failure to perform duties: Misrepresentation, falsification of test results and fraudulent billing
Failure to perform duties and/or incompetence: Lack of internal controls (to prevent tampering and manipulation of data) and lack of oversight of EACL operations
Failure to perform duties and/or incompetence: Conflicts of interest/commitment and improper hiring practices

Frank Shoop, a nonvoting member of the board who is member and past chairman of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, spoke about the importance of accurate and credible drug testing for horse racing. According to the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association, the thoroughbred industry brings in $115 million in tax revenue for the state annually. 
Shoop said a prominent testing facility used to be at the University of California-Davis. 
“A lot of people in this state worked a lot of years to get this to the University of Kentucky,” Shoop said.

Attorneys who asked a judge to make the Bureau of Land Management comply with an appeals court ruling announced that the federal agency has put off its plans to eliminate some herds until next summer.
The post ‘Checkerboard’ horse whiplash continues, southwestern Wyoming roundups now delayed until 2026 appeared first on WyoFile .","The on-again, off-again and heavily litigated roundup and elimination of more than 3,000 free-roaming horses from about 2.1 million acres of southwestern Wyoming is looking increasingly unlikely in 2025. 
Over the course of the last few months, the Bureau of Land Management’s plans have been OK’d administratively, but then appealed, delayed and found to be illegal by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal agency wasn’t fully deterred, however, and had scheduled the roundups for Oct. 13, triggering a Friends of Animals lawsuit aimed at stopping BLM from proceeding.

This week, more plaintiffs joined the fray with yet another lawsuit, seeking to block the 2025 removal operations, which will eventually eliminate the Salt Wells Creek Herd, Great Divide Basin Herd and northwestern portion of the Adobe Town Herd. Those pro-horse groups and individuals — American Wild Horse Conservation, Animal Welfare Institute, Carol Walker and Kimerlee Curyl — sent word Thursday that the federal government informed them the BLM’s plans have changed. 
“Late yesterday afternoon we heard from the Justice Department, which represents BLM, that … the roundup is not happening this year,” Bill Eubanks, an attorney for the petitioners, told WyoFile on Thursday. “It won’t happen before summer of 2026. That’s all we know. It’s just a written assurance by counsel.” 
The next step in the legal process is a status conference in the U.S District Court for Wyoming scheduled for early October. Attorneys will convene to discuss potential remedies to a 2-year-old Resource Management Plan amendment that the appeals court found to be illegal. The court ruled that the BLM didn’t demonstrate how eliminating horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance,” which is required by the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. 
The ongoing dispute over the existence of the Salt Wells Creek, Great Divide Basin and Adobe Town herds goes back 15 years. In 2010, the Rock Springs Grazing Association revoked consent for the free-roaming horses to exist on its property within the 40-mile-wide swath of southern Wyoming where interchanging public-private land forms a checkerboard pattern.

This story by Randolph T. Holhut was first published in The Commons on Sept. 9, 2025.
EAST DUMMERSTON — Read and Malah Miller have been running the Dwight Miller Orchard for more than three decades. Their succession plan was to start passing the operation on to his children this apple season.
“This was going be a transition year for us,” said Malah Miller. “We didn’t expect it to be this way.”
A three-alarm fire on Aug. 16 destroyed the orchard’s packing house building that was home to their cold storage and produce coolers, their cider press and apple packing facilities, their retail area and their maple evaporator and sugaring equipment.
“Everything went up in this building,” said Read. “Everything except for the orchard is gone. This building was the brain, heart, and soul of all our functions.”
Also lost were 25,000 gallons of apple cider vinegar, 1,000 gallons of maple syrup and 400 quart jars of pickles that they had just finished making for this season. “You could hear the pickle jars exploding in the fire,” said Read.
But within days of the fire, Malah began making another batch of pickles.
“When life gives you cucumbers, you make pickles,” she said. “You have to keep moving.”
When a fire destroys your business, you find a way to move forward. For the Miller family, they have an orchard full of apples to harvest, and they are finding a way to use this disaster not to mark the end of an eight-generation Vermont farm, but as a new chapter in its long history.
Dividing up a big task
Standing in front of the ruins of the packing house three weeks after the fire, Read talked about how his family has divided up rebuild.
His children, Will and Martha, are busy with running the business and shaping what it will be in future years. Read said he is busy with the difficult task of dealing with the insurance companies and government regulators, cleaning up the debris and documenting the damage.
“It’s huge, the emergency stuff,” Read said. “There are tractor-trailer loads of steel that need to be removed. I have to document and come up with the replacement value for every bit of the building, its contents, and what it was used for. And all that has to be perfect.”
Read said the orchard’s insurance will cover most, but not all, of the losses.
As for operations in the short term, Read said that “we’re going to stick with doing what we are comfortable with doing.”
That starts with the organic orchard’s pick-your-own operation on Miller Road, which began on Sept. 6. It will be open every day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., throughout the autumn.
Apples will continue to show up at the Brattleboro Area Farmers Market, but it may be a while before the farm returns to making organic apple cider and apple cider vinegar.
Read said the family bought a complete cider making setup, which is expected to arrive at the farm this week.
The replacement for the destroyed packing building, which was built in 1962 by Read’s father, Dwight, using timber harvested from the family’s wood lots, will be constructed in a similar manner.
“We have a lot of resources here on the farm, and a lot of people who want to help us rebuild,” Read said. “We have the opportunity to stand on our forefathers’ shoulders to rebuild, but we will need the help of our neighbors to do so.”
Read said the family “has all been affected by the fire,” and the challenge is “finding ways to stay together and be positive. The most important job for us is to come together.”
Malah said that she and Read are making sure that the Miller children are being given “lots of room to make their own future.”
Gratitude for the help
The community stepped up for the Millers in a big way, donating nearly $97,000 to the orchard’s GoFundMe appeal that was started by Martha.
“That was the kids’ idea,” Read said. “Reaching out for help is something I’m not totally comfortable with, but I’m past the age to be embarrassed. But my father always said that when someone offers to help, it’s rude to not accept it.”
Assistance has also been offered by Green Mountain Orchards in Putney and other neighboring farms.
Read said the family is committed to keeping the community informed about the recovery process and will keep people up to date through social media.
And, next Aug. 16, Read said the family hopes to have a gathering to mark the first anniversary of the fire and the progress that the farm has made.
“We’re blown away by the support,” said Malah. “It has been very humbling, and I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying to pay all that support forward.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Democrats are calling for Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation to support efforts to compel the release of information related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The Democratic National Committee launched a digital ad campaign Wednesday calling for Iowans to contact U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and “demand they release the files,” showcasing photos of Epstein and President Donald Trump together as well as of a suggestive birthday card allegedly signed by Trump that was released by Democrats on the U.S. House Oversight Committee on X Monday.
Releasing the “Epstein files” has been a point of contention in Congress for some time. Before the U.S. House recessed in July, there was a bipartisan attempt to compel the U.S. Department of Justice to release government investigative documents on Epstein, who died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting federal sex trafficking charges. House Republican leaders successfully stopped attempts to force the House to vote on this effort.

Though there are some Republicans calling for the release of the “Epstein files,” much of the push has come from Democrats, especially following news that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump his name appeared multiple times in government documents related to Epstein as well as the publishing of purported birthday letters from Trump to Epstein.
The members of Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation said in July they support publicizing more information related to the Florida financier, but that they backed the Trump administration and DOJ approach to releasing information, saying Democrats were using the issue for political gain.
The DNC ad campaign is specifically targeting Miller-Meeks, who represents Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. The district, containing cities including Iowa City, Davenport and Burlington, is predicted by political forecasters to be one of the most contentious races in the 2026 midterm elections.
In a statement on the ad campaign, DNC Chair Ken Martin criticized Republicans in Congress for “covering” for Trump by not supporting efforts to release more information on Epstein.
“If House Republicans can’t even stand up for the victims and survivors of a notorious sexual predator, if they won’t even call out the president for a blatant government coverup, then how can their voters trust them?” Martin said.
Miller-Meeks said in July that she stands with Trump “in his efforts to ensure transparency into Jeffrey Epstein’s heinous crimes while protecting the victims who endured so much abuse.”
Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, also called for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson to vote in support of the discharge petition to release files related to Epstein. Wahls and Hinson are both running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who announced earlier in September she will not seek reelection.
Wahls wrote that in light of the Democrat James Walkinshaw’s victory in the Virginia U.S. House special election who has signed or pledged to sign the discharge petition on the Epstein files” only one more representative’s support is needed to force a vote on issue. Wahls called on Hinson to join the four other House Republicans currently supporting the effort.
“Congresswoman Ashley Hinson is single-handedly blocking the release of the Epstein files,” Wahls said in a statement. “Instead of standing with survivors and the American people, she’s actively participating in a cover-up with Donald Trump and the rest of the D.C. swamp. Iowans deserve a Senator who will fight for transparency and accountability—not one who protects the powerful and hides the truth.”
Hinson has previously said she trusts Trump, Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel will “do the right thing” while pursuing justice and investigating Epstein.

The prescription is part of a standing order the health department announced on Thursday that is immediately effective and will remain so through of August of next year, unless withdrawn by Durham.
DOH Communications Director Robert Nott told Source NM the department recommends residents either print out a copy of the prescription or have it available on their phones when seeking the vaccine.
The standing order also follows updated protocols issued last week by the state Board of Pharmacy. Those protocols had emerged in response to an Aug. 29 public health order that directed the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
As Source NM previously reported, the Pharmacy Board protocol governs pharmacies’ distribution of vaccines. Previously, the protocol required the pharmacies to follow guidelines set by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. However, ACIP has yet to convene on current guidelines. In an interview with Source NM last week, NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said that lacking the ACIP guidelines, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
The revised protocol was intended to remove that problem. However, Nott said the department has “had some calls about pharmacists not understanding the order or still feeling like New Mexico residents need a prescription…With Dr. Miranda Durham’s signature on the prescription, you can use that as a prescription for a COVID [19] vaccine when you go to the pharmacy to eliminate any confusion about whether New Mexico residents need a prescription.”
A NMDOH news release notes that the standing order “addresses barriers that have prevented some New Mexicans from getting vaccinated. While most people could already receive vaccines through their providers, some pharmacists and healthcare providers were hesitant to vaccinate certain groups without formal prescription backup, particularly for off-label uses not specifically covered in FDA approvals.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the updated COVID-19 vaccine formulations, but added new restrictions that make people over the age of 65 eligible, but requires younger people to have an underlying medical issue for eligibility. The state health department’s standing order allows off-label use by qualified providers — physicians, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists holding an active and valid license in New Mexico — per professional guidelines and the health department’s recommendations. Those recommendations include providing vaccines “to any healthy person 2–64 years wishing protection.”
Thus the standing order “removes hesitation some providers had about vaccinating people who would benefit from the vaccine but fell outside the narrow FDA approval categories,” Durham said in a statement. “COVID-19 vaccines remain safe and effective tools for preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.”
In addition, the news release said, individuals enrolled in Medicaid will have the full cost of their COVID-19 vaccines covered.
The health department said anyone who is denied a COVID-19 vaccine should call the New Mexico Department of Health Helpline at 1-833-796-8773.
“We are clearing the way for New Mexicans who want the vaccine to get the vaccine,” NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in a statement. “This standing order ensures that barriers don’t prevent people from protecting their health.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-12.40.55 PM-1024x700.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)In state legislatures around the country, medication abortion has emerged as the central focus of the fight over abortion rights. As Democratic lawmakers in blue states enact shield laws to protect abortion medication prescribers, their Republican counterparts — particularly in states that have banned abortion — are filing a flurry of bills to restrict access.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without total abortion bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
Using medication to end a pregnancy requires taking two medications in succession: mifepristone to stop the pregnancy and misoprostol to induce contractions in the uterus to expel pregnancy tissue. These medications are also used by medical providers for other conditions, including to manage miscarriage and treat postpartum hemorrhage.
Research has shown medication abortion is effective and safe, with complications requiring hospitalization occurring in less than 0.3% of patients. Research also has shown medication abortion provided via telehealth is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Read on for an update on GOP-led state efforts to restrict access to abortion medication:
Reclassifying abortion pills as controlled substances
Last year, Louisiana — which has banned abortion — became the first state to pass a law reclassifying mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled substances, in the same class as drugs such as  Xanax and Valium. Hospitals in the state have had to change how the drugs are stored, locking them in passcode protected containers outside of delivery rooms. Physicians in the state have said the new restrictions have interfered with or negatively impacted their treatment of patients.
Republican lawmakers in Kentucky, Missouri and Texas introduced similar legislation in their most recent legislative sessions, though all three bills died in committee.
More states are expected to follow Louisiana’s lead in the coming legislative session.
Banning and restricting telehealth abortions
While most abortions occur in person, telehealth is a growing provider. By the end of last year, 1 in 4 abortions was provided via telehealth, according to #WeCount, a national reporting effort by the Society of Family Planning, an abortion research organization.
About half of those were from providers practicing in states with shield laws who mailed abortion pills to people in states with telehealth restrictions, six-week abortion bans or total abortion bans.
Nine states currently have laws that explicitly ban telehealth-provided medication abortion, or ban the mailing of medication abortion drugs, according to KFF, a research and policy organization. Those are Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia.
Eight Democratic-led states have shield laws designed to protect providers who offer medication abortion via telehealth to patients across state lines: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
But GOP-led states are fighting back.
Lawmakers in at least 14 states have introduced bills to criminalize the purchase, prescription and distribution of medication abortion, according to Jennifer Driver, who tracks reproductive state policy for the State Innovation Exchange, an organization focused on passing progressive state legislation.
In July, 15 Republican attorneys general signed a letter urging Congress to ban such shield laws because, they said, the laws interfere with states’ ability to enforce their own criminal laws.
Allowing citizen lawsuits
This month, the Texas Legislature passed a first-of-its-kind bill that would allow Texans to sue physicians, manufacturers and others from outside the state who mail abortion medication into the state. It also bans the manufacturing of abortion drugs in Texas. It’s now headed to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it.
The law is expected to set up a legal fight over whether one state’s laws can be enforced in another state.
Meanwhile, a Louisiana law passed in June and dubbed the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” allows the mother of a fetus to sue out-of-state doctors and activists for performing or facilitating a medication abortion, and extends the window for such lawsuits from three years to five years.

Buckley told lawmakers that 46 other states allow some sort of automatic restoration of voting rights for people convicted of crimes who have completed their sentences. Mississippi is one of only four states with a difficult application process for restoration, and given that only 207 people here had their rights restored from 1997 to 2004, it’s process may be the most restrictive. It requires lawmakers to pass by a two-thirds margin in each chamber an individual bill for each person’s rights to be restored, or a governor’s pardon.
The Mississippi Constitution drafted in 1890 in the Jim Crow era of racial discrimination listed 10 disenfranchising crimes — offenses that state leaders at the time believed Black people were more likely to commit. Since then, attorneys general interpretations added many more nonviolent, disenfranchising crimes.
Buckley said about 52,000 Mississippians, or about 2% of the voting age population, currently cannot vote because they have nonviolent felony records.

Buckley said many states provide for automatic restoration of rights after someone serves their sentence, fulfills their probation or parole, and-or makes financial restitution. She said making it automatic saves states money and reduces bureaucracy. But she said making such changes in Mississippi would most likely require a change in the state constitution, a heavier lift requiring a statewide vote rather than just lawmakers passing a law.
Rep. Noah Sanford, a Republican from Collins co-chairing the select committee, said he believes reform of felony suffrage restitution can pass the House. Rep. Price Wallace, a Republican from Mendenhall and co-chair, said Speaker White’s focus on the issue with the select committee will help suffrage reform legislation’s chances.
“I think there is broad consensus among House members that restoration of voting rights for nonviolent offenders is the right thing to do,” Sanford said. “But we are not kings, and there are two other levels it has to go through (the Senate and governor).”
MS has had on-again, off-again ballot initiative rights
Mississippians’ right to place issues directly on a statewide ballot is, technically, enshrined in the state constitution.
Mississippians had the right to ballot initiative starting in 1914, but the state Supreme Court threw it out in 1922. Voters restored the right by passing a constitutional amendment in 1992, but the Supreme Court again nullified it on a technical issue in a lawsuit over voters passing a medical marijuana initiative in 2020.
The right to initiative in the state constitution includes requirements for gathering voter signatures from Mississippi’s five congressional districts. But in 2001, the state lost a district from population loss, and the court ruled the initiative inoperative. Since then, despite calls from voters and advocates to restore it, lawmakers have dickered over details and signature thresholds and failed to restore the right.
Buckley told lawmakers Thursday that the simplest way to restore the right would be to change constitutional language on signature gathering from five districts to four, or have language adapting to whatever number of districts the state has at the time of an initiative effort.
Buckley said 23 other states, plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands, have some sort of functioning ballot initiative process.
Lawmakers have debated how stringent the requirements for placing an issue directly before voters should be. Some fear sidestepping the state’s representative form of government could allow special interests with deep pockets to game the system. Others say the state’s previous requirements were too strict.

Buckley noted that, from 1992 until the high court ruling in 2021, Mississippi voters passed only three initiatives — one restricting eminent domain, one requiring voters to provide IDs and one (the court struck down) approving medical marijuana.
Mississippi’s ballot initiative in the past gave voters the right to change the state constitution. But lawmakers have also considered allowing it only for addressing state law.
Buckley said allowing it for state law might prove problematic because “when the public makes a decision, the Legislature could then change it back — what does that mean about the process?” She noted that states’ ballot initiative processes vary.
“No state really has a template,” she said. “Every state does it differently.”
Early voting faces uphill battle
Mississippi is one of three states — along with Alabama and New Hampshire — that does not allow in person early voting. In her presentation, she gave an example of the difficult process “Frank,” who would be out of town on Election Day, would have to go through to vote absentee beforehand in Mississippi.
Buckley said that in most states, in-person early voting “mimics most of Election Day practices.” She said it would reduce paperwork and clerical mistakes from Mississippi’s absentee voting process and mean shorter lines and less people walking away without voting on Election Day.
But early voting in Mississippi and other states has brought much debate, oftentimes partisan, with many Republican officials opposing it. Gov. Tate Reeves has been very vocal with his opposition to it.
Sanford said that of the three issues the committee is tackling, allowing early voting might face the most uphill battle.
“The governor remains opposed to early voting, and he’s made that extremely clear that it’s not subject to change,” Sanford said. “I’m not saying we are not going to work on early voting — compromise is the name of the game — but that may not be the focus as much as suffrage restoration and ballot initiative.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11114638/3X0A7482-1.jpg,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

Standardized test scores for Washington public school students improved slightly this year, according to data the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction released Wednesday.
But the scores remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and the test results show nearly a third of students are not meeting grade-level standards in math, while the same is true for about a quarter of students when it comes to English. 
There are stark disparities as well, with around half of the students in some racial and ethnic minority groups getting the lowest possible score on the math tests.

“We still have a ways to go,” Superintendent Chris Reykdal said during a press briefing. 
He added that growth in the test scores “is now not only exceeding the immediate post-pandemic struggles we had, but it’s at a faster trajectory of growth than even pre-pandemic.” 
Reykdal pointed out that across the U.S. and around the world, forces such as social media, economic stress, and the risk of violence in schools are posing obstacles for students. 
The state tests, administered each spring in grades three through eight and 10, are required by the federal government. They are designed to assess whether a student is on track for college-level learning without needing remedial courses.
The Smarter Balanced Assessment used by Washington and 11 other states scores students on a 1-to-4 scale based on their test results.
Federal requirements call for the state to report level 3 and 4 scores “as meeting the standard of being on track for college-level learning without needing remedial courses,” Katy Payne, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, said in an email yesterday. 
The data show that, overall, 50.9% of students are meeting this standard in English language arts and 40.7% in math. 
Last year, 50.3% of students scored a 3 or 4 on the English assessment, and 39.7% on the math tests. In the year before the pandemic, those figures were 59.6% for English and 48.9% for math.
Revised approach to interpreting scores
Payne said that in 2024, “after seeing how the state test score results were being mischaracterized across the nation,” Smarter Balanced, the vendor behind the tests, clarified that students who earn level 2 scores are also “demonstrating grade-level knowledge.”
OSPI now emphasizes that scores of 2 and up demonstrate “foundational grade-level knowledge and skills with a limited range of complexity.” 
Under this approach, the data shows that 70.9% of students are at or above grade level in English language arts and 63.3% of students are at or above grade level in math. 
Reykdal cautioned against equating low standardized test scores with failing academically in a subject, saying the tests are a point-in-time measurement intended to track trends.
He noted student data showing significant variability in their individual scores year-to-year as an example of why the standardized test isn’t a good measurement for an individual student’s success. 
“These assessments matter because it gives us important trend data for our state, and the more students assess, the better our accuracy,” Reykdal said. “But for any given student, gosh, if you had a bad day on a Thursday in May … you can get these kinds of results.” 
The trend data provided by the tests shows that Washington students are generally performing consistently with, or better than, their peers across the U.S., though Washington’s math scores have been steadily declining in relation to the performance of other states. 
Compared to the 11 other states that use the same assessment, last year’s test results show Washington ranked second overall in English and fourth in math.
The data also show that low-income students – defined as students who qualify for free or reduced lunch – consistently score lower than their higher-income peers. 
There are achievement gaps for several minority groups as well. For example, while 24.6% of white students scored only a 1 on the math assessment, the same was true for 47.6% of Black students, 53.9% of Native American students, and 56% of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students.
“There are student populations that need additional investment,” Reykdal said. 
“Those kinds of investments have moved the needle, which is great, but the gap is still very large,” he added. 
Legislative request focused on math
In an effort to improve Washington’s math scores, Reykdal said he plans to ask the Legislature for $10 million to fund professional learning for teachers, with a focus on those teaching kindergarten through eighth grade. 
“They’re not math majors, and they don’t need to be, but they need targeted instruction on how to move kids, particularly those who are behind in math,” he said. 
The funding would also be used to teach schools innovative models for learning math and to buy statewide licenses for some software tools that would be made available to elementary school students.
“It’s time to complement the hard work of our teachers with tools that kids can get excited about and work on at home as well as in the classroom, all while we remind students that foundational work is something they’ve got to be able to do without assistive technology,” Reykdal said. 
Reykdal plans to make a separate request in next year’s legislative session for $110 million per year to offset inflationary cost increases for schools.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-10-at-5.11.01-PM-1024x622.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Photo courtesy Heinrich’s office)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and other Senate Democrats are calling on the Forest Service chief to explain alleged discrepancies in his accounting for ongoing payouts of thousands of Forest Service employees who opted into early retirements or resignations earlier this year. 
The lawmakers’ Sept. 9 letter notes that Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz has identified two contradictory funding sources for accrued sick leave and vacation payments to roughly 5,000 Forest Service employees who opted into the Deferred Resignation Program during government-wide buyouts this spring. 
The Forest Service claims it’s fully staffed for a worsening fire season. Data shows otherwise

One of those funding sources, from an account typically used for forest research and local forestry, paid out more than federal Agriculture Department leaders said is necessary to cover the expenses. The other funding source imposes limits on the amount of spending for salaries, according to the letter.
“These significant discrepancies require clarification and accounting to Congress,” the senators wrote in the letter. Along with Heinrich, other signers included U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Jeffrey Merkley (D-Ore.) 
According to the letter, the resignations require at least $48 million this fiscal year for Forest Service employees. However, the senators are calling on the Forest Service to account for exactly how much early retirements and resignations programs cost taxpayers. 
The reduction in Forest Service employees, done at the urging of Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” aimed to cut federal spending and occurred alongside widespread layoffs, including in New Mexico.

According to a spreadsheet Heinrich’s office provided to Source New Mexico, 372 Forest Service employees in New Mexico accepted the deferred resignation offer. They made up the vast majority of 500 New Mexico USDA employees who took the offer, according to the spreadsheet. 
In addition to the resignations, several dozen Forest Service employees were fired in New Mexico, though many were later re-hired. 
A spokesperson for the Forest Service did not immediately respond to Source New Mexico’s question about that number or a response to the senators’ letter. 
The letter gives the Forest Service until Sept. 22 to reply to nine questions about the funding and where it comes from, including why Schultz gave different answers about the funding source. It also seeks a detailed accounting of how much will be required to pay out salaries, expenses and accrued leave as of the day they stopped reporting to work.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/heinrich.png,,,2025-09-11 15:57:26.340247

(Florida House photo by Meredith Geddings) Paul Renner, the Republican former Florida House speaker who has just launched a campaign for governor, lacks the backing of either President Donald Trump or Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Renner says it doesn’t matter — he still expects to win the GOP nomination by taking advantage of a deepening rift between DeSantis supporters and Trump loyalists ahead of the 2026 gubernatorial race and legislative session. Renner believes he may have the “unifying” message conservative voters are looking for.
“It looks like there may be a looming civil war, and I’m going to put Florida first. That’s going to be my approach,” Renner told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview. “I think the race will look very different a year from now than it does today.”
Renner, 58, referred to the growing tension between Trump and DeSantis allies as they prepare for a reignited proxy battle between the two firebrands. Trump has backed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, while DeSantis has been elevating Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.
This leaves Renner to seek a third lane to the governor’s mansion, without a substantial backer.
Political analyst Susan MacManus, professor emerita at the University of South Florida, said Renner’s success depends on his ability to drive media attention, rake in money, and whether his rivals implode.
“The key is, will the other two end up destroying each other and leave an avenue for someone like him? That’s really the only real strategy that he’s got right now,” MacManus told the Phoenix. 
Renner has roughly $1 million in his political committee account, compared to Donalds’ $22 million.
Collins, who has yet to announce a bid, has around $500,000 in his committee account and a reported net worth under $2 million.
Renner plans to emphasize his alignment with Trump’s MAGA agenda while defining his record as “inseparable” from DeSantis’s legacy, which was largely built when Renner served as House Speaker. 
He played a key role in passing controversial legislation that served as a springboard for DeSantis’s 2023 presidential campaign, including a first-in-the-nation crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; expanding the death penalty to child rapists; banning transgender therapies for minors; and a stringent six-week abortion ban.
Still, DeSantis has publicly refused to endorse Renner. 
Renner isn’t fazed.
“Once voters have the year that’s ahead of us to look at all the candidates, I do believe that I’ll be successful to become the Republican nominee, and then ultimately go on to beat whoever the Democrats put up,” the Jacksonville-area attorney said.
But that will be a tall task for the gubernatorial hopeful.

‘Ego and politics and pettiness’
Renner served as House speaker from 2022 through 2024 as DeSantis flexed an iron grasp over the Legislature. The period was marked by a sweeping Republican supermajority and very little pushback from within against DeSantis, partially due to Renner. DeSantis’ priorities easily slid through the Legislature to help construct the platform from which he would launch his presidential campaign.
Renner remains in lockstep with DeSantis on top issues facing Florida, including supporting mid-decade redistricting, signing a repeal of all vaccine mandates, and slicing or eliminating property taxes, he said.
That in-sync image Republicans constructed under Renner’s two-year tenure shattered when the new House speaker, Daniel Perez, a Miami Republican, asserted the House’s independence from the executive branch. Kicking off the latest era of Republican infighting, Perez attempted to stymie DeSantis throughout the 2025 session, encouraging House investigatory committees to comb through the finances of First Lady Casey DeSantis’s Hope Florida charity while criticizing the governor as “emotional.”
It marked the first time during DeSantis’ tenure that he presided over an openly defiant GOP-led Legislature.
Renner fears these open clashes are dangerous for the Republican Party — which has more than 1 million more registered voters than Democrats — and augur a larger battle within the GOP. Reflecting on his own speakership alongside then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, Renner revealed that although they had disagreed with DeSantis at times, they always worked it out privately.
“Through intermediaries, we talked about where we had differences, we worked through those, and then we came out in public, arm in arm. That’s why we were so successful,” Renner said, declining to specify what disagreements he had with the governor.
“I’m going to always put the mission and the goal of what Floridians need ahead of ego and politics and pettiness. I have no use for it,” he added.
‘You got to deliver wins’
Renner would be the first former House Speaker to become Florida governor in recent history, signaling that while legislative leaders wield significant influence during their tenure, building broader name recognition remains a tough obstacle to achieving higher office.
Polling from the conservative Tyson Group, helmed by former DeSantis pollster Ryan Tyson, shows Donalds with a commanding lead over Renner and Collins. That distance lengthens when voters are told about Donalds’ Trump endorsement.
Donalds’ 40% to Renner’s and Collins’ 2% apiece doesn’t mean much this long before the Aug. 2026 primary, Renner, a Navy veteran, argues. Historically, candidates previously thought to be surefire winners early in the race ended up losing.
“‘Bill McCollum’s going to be your next governor. Adam Putnam’s going to be your next governor. Little Marco Rubio from the speaker’s office is at 2%, like Paul Renner is — they’re never going to make it,’” he said, mimicking political operatives and drawing comparisons between himself and Marco Rubio, a former state House speaker who now serves as Trump’s Secretary of State and National Security Adviser.
“The people that counted Marco out — and many did — are the same voices that are saying look, this guy’s got money, he’s way ahead, he’s got an endorsement. And that’s just not what voters ultimately want,” Renner continued. 
He said voters want someone with proven wins and a record of having “run something” to lead the country’s third largest state.
“Everybody can talk in bumper stickers, and do interviews, and post on social media — and I’ll certainly do some of those things. But you got to deliver some results. You got to deliver wins,” he added.
The winner of the Republican primary will face off against the Democratic nominee for the governor’s race. The only prominent Democrat in the race so far is David Jolly, a former U.S. representative.

Kelley had no information on how the suspect obtained the weapon.

Read it here.
Los comedores populares, los refugios para personas sin hogar y los centros preescolares de California pueden seguir atendiendo a quienes no tienen estatus legal, al menos temporalmente, según una decisión tomada hoy por un juez de un tribunal de distrito de Estados Unidos en Rhode Island.
En julio, cuatro departamentos federales —Educación, Justicia, Salud y Servicios Humanos, y Trabajo— ordenaron a California que rechazara a muchos inmigrantes el acceso a servicios públicos financiados con fondos federales, como la atención médica, la educación y la capacitación laboral. Las nuevas normas se aplican a ciertas categorías de inmigrantes, tanto a quienes no tienen estatus legal como a quienes lo tienen, como los solicitantes de asilo o quienes tienen visas de estudiante.
California se unió rápidamente a otros 20 estados y al Distrito de Columbia en una demanda , argumentando que los cambios en las políticas eran ilegales. El fallo, que constituye una medida cautelar, significa que el gobierno federal no puede aplicar las nuevas políticas en estos estados hasta que se resuelva la demanda, cuya resolución podría tardar meses o años.

 “Con la decisión de hoy, programas vitales de educación, nutrición y salud como Head Start, y las familias que dependen de sus servicios, pueden respirar tranquilos”, declaró Nina Sheridan, portavoz de la Fiscalía General de California. Head Start ofrece educación preescolar gratuita a niños de bajos recursos en todo el estado.
 “La Administración Trump sigue poniendo trabas a las familias californianas que solo intentan sobrevivir, pero estamos contraatacando”, dijo. “Agradecemos que un Tribunal de Distrito haya puesto fin a esta cruel nueva directiva mientras continúa nuestro litigio”.
 Los cuatro departamentos federales declararon en julio que las nuevas políticas eran un esfuerzo por cumplir con una de las órdenes ejecutivas de Trump, que afirma que los beneficios públicos fomentan la inmigración ilegal. La orden ejecutiva exige a los departamentos federales garantizar que ningún beneficio financiado por los contribuyentes se destine a extranjeros no cualificados.
 Un abogado del Departamento de Justicia, Sean Skedzielewski, dijo que las nuevas políticas también reflejan la interpretación adecuada de la ley federal, a pesar del hecho de que el Departamento de Justicia ha utilizado una interpretación diferente durante casi 30 años.
 En su decisión escrita que emitió la orden judicial preliminar, la jueza federal de distrito Mary McElroy expresó su escepticismo ante el argumento legal de Skedzielewski. «El Gobierno (federal) argumenta que, de alguna manera, ha interpretado incorrectamente este estatuto durante los casi treinta años que lleva vigente. En su opinión, todos (de todas las administraciones anteriores) lo han malinterpretado desde el principio, al menos hasta el mes pasado, cuando el Gobierno (federal) comprendió claramente la forma correcta de interpretarlo».
 McElroy escribió que las nuevas políticas, que ahora están suspendidas, significarían que “menos personas recibirán recursos críticos contra la pobreza debido a que las comunidades inmigrantes evitan los servicios, pero también porque, en general, las personas que viven en la pobreza a veces carecen de identificación gubernamental”. 
 ¿Quién califica para recibir beneficios públicos?
 En 1996, el Congreso aprobó una ley que restringía la mayoría de los beneficios públicos financiados por el gobierno federal a los ciudadanos estadounidenses o a quienes tenían ciertos estatus legales, como la tarjeta de residencia permanente. Posteriormente, al aclarar la ley, el gobierno federal estableció ciertas excepciones.
 Cualquier persona, independientemente de su estatus legal, puede acceder a un centro de atención telefónica para crisis, y cualquier menor que haya sufrido abandono o abuso puede recibir asistencia pública, ya que estos servicios son “necesarios para la protección de la vida y la seguridad”, según la guía federal de 1996 , que aclaró el significado de la ley de ese año. Los albergues para personas sin hogar y víctimas de violencia doméstica, los hospitales públicos y los programas de apoyo a la salud mental o la recuperación del consumo de sustancias también están disponibles para todos.
 Como resultado de una decisión de la Corte Suprema de 1982, el gobierno federal permite que todos los estudiantes menores de 18 años, independientemente de su estatus legal, asistan a la escuela pública. Los inmigrantes sin estatus legal también pueden acceder a Head Start e inscribirse en clases de educación para adultos, que incluyen inglés como segundo idioma y programas de equivalencia de bachillerato.
 En el condado de Santa Clara, que abarca San José, aproximadamente el 40% de los residentes son nacidos en el extranjero y más de la mitad de los niños del condado tienen un padre nacido en el extranjero. El condado recibe alrededor de 3.700 millones de dólares en fondos federales cada año, la mayor parte de los cuales financia su sistema de hospitales públicos, según una declaración judicial de Greta Hanson, directora de operaciones del condado.
 Verificar el estatus legal de los pacientes no es factible, afirmó, pero incluso si lo fuera, “tendría consecuencias extremadamente perjudiciales y disuadiría a las personas de buscar la atención que tanto necesitan”. Si una persona tiene una enfermedad contagiosa pero evita buscar atención, por ejemplo, podría poner en peligro la salud de toda su comunidad.
 Aunque las nuevas políticas entraron en vigor en julio, el sistema de salud aún no ha rechazado a ningún paciente. Los estados en la demanda y los cuatro departamentos federales acordaron retrasar la aplicación de las nuevas políticas hasta el 11 de septiembre. Debido a la orden judicial preliminar de hoy, la promulgación de las políticas tardará meses o incluso años, y si el juez finalmente falla a favor de California, es posible que nunca entren en vigor.
 Esta es solo una de las muchas demandas que California ha presentado contra la administración Trump por el trato a los inmigrantes. En un intento por implementar una orden ejecutiva presidencial diferente, que exigía a los departamentos federales detener el despilfarro, el fraude y el abuso , el Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA) solicitó a California que compartiera datos privados sobre las personas que reciben cupones de alimentos.
 En julio, fiscales generales demócratas, incluido el fiscal general de California, Rob Bonta, demandaron al USDA, alegando que su objetivo es atacar a las familias de estatus migratorio mixto , donde los ciudadanos estadounidenses pueden tener un familiar extranjero. California también demandó a la Administración Trump por el despliegue de la Guardia Nacional después de que las redadas federales de inmigración provocaran protestas en Los Ángeles este verano.
 En total, California ha demandado o se ha unido a otros estados para demandar al gobierno federal aproximadamente 40 veces desde la toma de posesión del presidente. Durante el primer gobierno de Trump, California demandó al presidente 123 veces y ganó aproximadamente dos tercios de esos casos.
 Muchas de las demandas presentadas este año ya han dado lugar a medidas cautelares que han detenido temporalmente las nuevas políticas de la administración Trump, pero los defensores de los inmigrantes dicen que, no obstante, las acciones del presidente han tenido un impacto.
 Muchos californianos, incluyendo aquellos con estatus legal, evitan los servicios públicos por miedo. Algunos tienen miedo incluso de salir de casa.
 En una escuela para adultos en Huntington Beach, el director Steve Curiel comentó que pocos inmigrantes asisten a clases de inglés este verano. Comentó que ha escuchado que otras escuelas del estado están observando la misma tendencia.

But the state Supreme Court was told Thursday that no change in the state’s 1891 Constitution is needed to allow charter schools under a law the Republican-controlled legislature approved in […],"The Kentucky Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Danville this week in Newlin Hall at Centre College's Norton Center for the Arts. Centre students and students from nearby schools observed the proceedings. (Administrative Office of the Courts)Voters might have thought they settled the question of charter schools in Kentucky last year when a “school choice” amendment failed in all 120 counties.
But the state Supreme Court was told Thursday that no change in the state’s 1891 Constitution is needed to allow charter schools under a law the Republican-controlled legislature approved in 2022.
Kentucky Solicitor General Matthew Kuhn said the charter school law does not violate the constitutional mandate to “provide for an efficient system of common schools” but would instead improve the system’s efficiency by expanding opportunities.
The charter school law “fits neatly in our tradition of common schools,” said Kuhn on behalf of Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman. “In our common school system, the status quo can never be good enough.”
Lawyers for an education advocacy group and two local school districts contended the charter school law fails several constitutional tests, including a requirement that tax-funded schools be overseen by elected boards accountable to voters.
Attorney Byron Leet, representing the Council for Better Education and the Jefferson County and Dayton Independent school boards, called the law “the latest attempt by the General Assembly to redirect public school money, public funds to schools operating outside the common school system without the approval of Kentucky’s voters as required by the Constitution.” 
The attorney general’s office is asking the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling by Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd who struck down the charter school law and enjoined its implementation in December 2023.
Shepherd wrote then that the “policy goals of the legislation are not at issue in this case” but that there “is no way to stretch the definition of ‘common schools’ so broadly that it would include such privately owned and operated schools that are exempt from the statutes and administrative regulations governing public school education.”
Kentucky Supreme Court
Defending the law, Kuhn said Shepherd in his ruling had misapplied the 1989 Supreme Court opinion in Rose v. Council for Better Education, the landmark ruling that paved the way for the Kentucky Education Reform Act.  
He said Shepherd’s ruling “treated Rose effectively as a straight jacket that prevents the legislature from meaningfully changing the common school system. Rose, however, requires the General Assembly to continually strive to improve on the status quo.” 
Also arguing in support of the charter school law was attorney Paul Salamanca, representing Gus La Fonatine who is seeking to open a charter school in Madison County under the 2022 law. 
‘Outside looking in’
In response to questions from the justices about charter schools being allowed to turn away students when their enrollment limit is reached, Salamanca said “that’s a good problem” because it’s a sign the school is filling a need. “And HB 9 (the charter school law) has a solution. You can start another school and another school. They can keep starting …  if that’s what people want.”
Both Kuhn and Salamanca told the court that 45 states have charter schools, including all the states bordering Kentucky, and praised their performance. They also likened charter schools to magnet schools in Louisville and Lexington that specialize in arts or academic rigor, saying charter schools would focus on serving at-risk youngsters who are not being well served in their current schools.
“Kentucky kids are really on the outside looking in on what has been a resounding success, especially in urban areas,” Kuhn said. “And so I really ask the court not to leave Kentucky kids on the outside looking in for this important educational development.”
Leet disputed the success of charter schools. “Let me just say there is nothing remotely resembling a consensus that charter schools are a wonderful thing. But frankly, I don’t think that’s the issue.” He said the questions before the court hinge on more than a century of legal precedent. 
A provision in the law allows school boards in districts with fewer than 7,500 students to veto charter schools. Justice Angela McCormick Bisig questioned whether the provision would create discrepancies in offerings available to students across the state.
Justice Michelle M. Keller in her questions focused on the potential harms from diverting money from existing schools into charter schools that “parents or the public at large who are actually paying the taxes have no control over. … We’re going to be paying the taxes through our property assessment tax we pay now, but we will have zero control over who administers the charter schools,” Keller said, in contrast to elected local boards who now oversee school districts. 
‘Million dollar question’
Justice Pamela Goodwine asked what she called the “million dollar question,” noting that since the charter school law was enacted and enjoined, the General Assembly had put on the ballot an amendment giving voters the opportunity to “empower the legislature to use public funds for charter schools.”
“Should that impact our decision, or should we just ignore the nearly two thirds of the voters who do not wish to have taxpayer funds used in this manner?” Goodwine asked.
Salamanca acknowledged that if voters had approved the amendment “we wouldn’t be here today.”
But he contended that charter schools as they would be governed and operated under the Kentucky law meet constitutional muster.
“The referendum asked whether the people of Kentucky supported the idea of the General Assembly appropriating money for schools outside the system of common schools. We are not outside the system of common schools.”
Goodwine drew a flutter of laughter when she said, “So did the legislature not know how to word the amendment on the ballot or were they trying to mislead the voters?”

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Curlew Hills Memory Garden in Palm Harbor on Sept. 11, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)PALM HARBOR — Speaking during a 9/11 remembrance event in Pinellas County Thursday, Gov. Ron DeSantis linked the tragic events of that day 24 years ago with the killing of prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk, saying his fatal shooting displayed “some of the evil that’s lurking within.”
“That attack [on 9/11] was an exterior attack, with people who were emanating from foreign lands with a foreign ideology. And yesterday we saw the assassination of a young political leader, Charlie Kirk — who I knew, many of you probably knew — and you see some of the evil that’s lurking within,” DeSantis said.
He praised Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, for his ability to bring conservative viewpoints to college campuses, which he called “usually hostile terrain” for political conservatives, including himself.
The proper response to disagreeing with someone’s views is “not to shout or scream someone down. It’s not to create unrest so that the mob makes the event not happen. And it is certainly not that you kill somebody in order to silence them,” he said, as the crowd applauded.
“So, as we commemorate the lives we lost that day because of that terrorist attack, and as we recognize the evil that was present in this country as a result of this external force and this external ideology,” he continued, “let’s not now 24 years later succumb as a country to some of those forces inside our country who are really trying to upend what America is all about.”
DeSantis offered the remarks at Curlew Hills Memory Garden in Palm Harbor, a location close to where he grew up in Dunedin.
When speaking about the Al-Qaeda attacks, the governor recalled how that event changed the trajectory of his own life. If it had not occurred, he said, it was unlikely he would have become a Naval officer.
DeSantis enlisted in 2004 while in his second year at Harvard Law School and joined the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2006. He was awarded a Bronze Star for meritorious service and received at least 10 awards and decorations.
The governor gave tribute not just to the nearly 3,000 people in New York City, the Washington area, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, who died on Sept. 11, 2001, but to the tens of thousands of first responders who sacrificed their own health that day and weeks and months later at Ground Zero in New York City.

Giving tribute to the first responders
“There’s been many that have died in the years since as a result of what they did that day and in the ensuing days,” he said.
“There’s others — first responders — who are still suffering from very significant afflictions as a result of their service on that day. So, all in, you’re looking at way more than 3,000 people as a result of that terrorist attack on 9/11. And I know we’ve got some folks that have since relocated to Florida who are battling different types of illnesses as it relates to that day and their service after, and just know this day is a day to also thank them for what they did and just express sympathy for what they’re still going through, because it’s been very difficult for a lot of people and a lot of families.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 24,000 responders who worked at the site in Lower Manhattan or at the debris-sorting pile on Staten Island have developed cancer, and more than 8,000 responders and survivors have died.
Nearly 3,800 of those who died had cancer, although the C.D.C. does not track whether cancer was the cause of death or the death was caused by 9/11-related illness.
Shortly after the event, the governor’s office announced that in response to a directive from President Trump and in honor of Charlie Kirk’s memory, the flags of the U.S. and the state of Florida will be flown at half-staff at all local and state buildings, installations and grounds throughout the state until sunset this Sunday.

“We're just day-by-day trying to chip away the gaps in these really important wildlife corridors,” the Department of Fish & Wildlife’s land acquisition coordinator said.

As the chestnut-sided warbler flits about the quaking aspen trees under the shadow of Birdseye Mountain in Castleton, Vermonters can hunt, fish, trap, birdwatch and trek in perpetuity along the nearly 5,000 acres of land conserved by the state, thanks to a now-completed conservation plan, state officials say. 
After eight years, the Department of Fish & Wildlife finished drafting last month its long-term plan for the land in Castleton, comprising the Birdseye and Blueberry Hill Wildlife Management Areas, according to the department’s state and private lands biologist Travis Hart. Like a quilt, Hart said, the state aims to stitch together a “patchwork” of different habitats to ensure species diversity and connectivity through permanent conservation efforts. 
The wildlife management areas situated in the Taconic Mountains bring together a unique mixture of plant and animal species and landscape features, providing a “critical link for wildlife and ecological processes across Route 4” to the Green Mountain National Forest, said John Austin, director of wildlife for the department. 
Over the next 20 years, Hart said the department plans to manage 4% of the Castleton land for ephemeral young growth forests while actively promoting the development of old growth forests on 24% of the land. The state lost much of its old growth forest during European settlement and logging for agriculture in the 1800s, and now conservationists are taking varied approaches to grow back the old growth trees, knowing their work will not come to fruition for decades if not generations.
This is one of many conservation milestones in southern Vermont in recent months, guided by Fish & Wildlife’s Vermont Conservation Design, which plans out the landscape for ecological functions, said Robert Zaino, a natural community ecologist with the department.
The areas contribute to the state’s overall conservation goal outlined in Act 59, a 2023 law that aims to permanently conserve 30% of land in Vermont by 2030, said Rebecca Washburn, director of lands administration and recreation for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
The state had already conserved 27% of land as of last year, Washburn said. Looking to fill the 3% gap in the next five years, Washburn said that departments within the Agency of Natural Resources, alongside conservation groups and land acquisition partners, are looking to invest in tracts of land that promote species connectivity, biodiversity and ecological community resilience.

Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, the main sponsor of Act 59, said the legislative intent was to ensure that the range of nine biophysical regions in the state are all addressed through different conservation models, including improving biodiversity, engaging sustainable forestry and resource management and allowing some lands to grow wild without human interference. 
For Sheldon, Act 59 — the Community Resilience and Biodiversity Protection Act — was born out of a recognition that “we need to turn the ship in order to make sure we don’t miss opportunities to conserve all of our natural communities before it’s too late.”
Through Vermont Conservation Design’s statewide mapping tool, BioFinder, Zaino said the state identifies which forest blocks serve as the highest priority “stepping stones” that help species move across the regional landscape between the Berkshires in Massachusetts, the Adirondacks in New York, the White Mountains in New Hampshire and the Gaspé Peninsula across the national border in Quebec.
Vermont’s southern region has relatively little permanently conserved land other than the federal Green Mountain National Forest, Zaino said. The state’s work with conservation partners to acquire high-priority tracts for permanent conservation is an effort to “safeguarding places that we know have this very high ecological value into the future.”

Partners acquiring land for ‘connectivity pathways’  
One such effort the state and the Conservation Fund completed this summer focused on a patchwork of land in the Chateauguay Forest. 
In June, the state was awarded $2.9 million in federal Forest Legacy Program funds to purchase and manage five parcels, said Kate Sudhoff, land conservation program manager for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
This includes nearly 900 acres on Sable Mountain in Stockbridge, which will be added to the Les Newell Wildlife Management Area, and the Long Hill and Chase Corners parcels in Reading totalling nearly 800 acres that will be added to the Calvin Coolidge State Forest. Sudhoff said the state is still working to purchase two more conservation easement parcels in Bridgewater and Killington with the federal funding.
The three plots are situated within the state’s oldest regional conservation initiative, the Chateauguay No Town Conservation Project.

Will Duane, land acquisition coordinator for Fish & Wildlife, said the Sable Mountain, Long Hill and Chase Corners parcels are higher elevation areas that lead to a menagerie of biodiversity on the landscape. The three plots are also critical “puzzle pieces” to build out protected natural areas for species movement as the state manages the land for public recreation, wildlife habitat and as a working landscape, Duane said.  
“We’re creating these connectivity pathways and these corridors for species to move back and forth, and the Sable Mountain piece is in a huge critical core habitat block in Stockbridge right there in the heart of the Green Mountains,” Duane said.  
Sally Manikian, the New Hampshire and Vermont director of The Conservation Fund, said the “organizing force” behind permanently conserved tracts of land was expanding public access to outdoor recreation along the skinny and vulnerable corridor of the Appalachian Trail connecting the Green Mountain National Forest to the White Mountains.
Another state partner, the Trust for Public Land, has also made strides toward the state’s goals, permanently conserving 500 acres at the gateway of the Robert T. Stafford White Rocks National Recreation Area near the Appalachian Trail in Wallingford in March.

Shelby Semmes, the Vermont and New Hampshire state director of the trust, said the group is in the early stages of acquiring three parcels totaling over 300 acres in Dorset, which is a part of a partnership with the Vermont Huts & Trails to create a long-distance mountain biking “Velomont” trail. 
The project on the Dorset ridgeline is particularly valuable, Semmes said, because half the land is located across the Rich Northern Harwood Forest and it will conserve habitat around the northeast’s largest cave and bat hibernation site — the Dorset Bat Cave. 
In the small rural town of Jamaica, the Northeast Wilderness Trust is taking a different approach to permanent land conservation. 
In August, the trust acquired an easement on 600 acres of land for the College Hill Wilderness Sanctuary near Stratton Mountain and the Green Mountain National Forest in Windham County, which will remain permanently conserved as a “forever wild,” Northeast Wilderness Trust President Jon Leibowitz said. 
“Forever-wild conservation is a commitment that people make to a particular piece of land where we allow nature to have the freedom to evolve in a way that it directs the ebb and flow of life rather than people managing or manipulating a forest,” Leibowitz said. 
Duane said that fragmentation across the landscape makes it more difficult for species to move about, so the work of the state and conservation groups is to strategically create throughways for wildlife. 
“We’re just day-by-day trying to chip away the gaps in these really important wildlife corridors,” Duane said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-11 18:25:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Homelessness rises in CT as federal funding remains in flux,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/11/ct-homelessness-point-in-time-count/,"There were 3,735 people living in shelters or outside in CT in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. That’s nearly a 10% increase.","A new report shows that Connecticut’s homeless population grew for the fourth year in a row from 2024 to 2025.
The state’s latest point-in-time count, which is an annual census of the homeless population, showed that there were 3,735 people living in shelters or outside in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. That’s nearly a 10% increase, which is a smaller rate increase than last year’s report.
“The overall trend from this year’s count shows that the inflow of people into the homeless response system is more than providers of shelter and services can keep up with,” said Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness.
On Thursday, the National Alliance to End Homelessness and Women’s Development Corporation filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development over restrictions on federal housing grants. 
HUD’s new funding allocation rules consider whether shelters are in jurisdictions with sanctuary protections for undocumented people and whether shelters provide services around harm reduction for drug use, and they take into account policies around serving transgender people. The rules have left some providers uncertain about whether they’d get the money they need to continue operations.
The lawsuit asks for a temporary restraining order on the rules, and the organizations said in a press release that the rules are “unconstitutional and unlawful.”
Connecticut gets about $95 million annually from the federal government for homelessness and housing stability.
“It’s a very fluid situation, but these are the dollars that keep people housed year after year across the state, and they’re critical. We’re watching it, and then we’re trying to figure out the best steps forward as a state,” Fox said of the HUD policies.
Late last month, HUD ordered all public housing authorities to conduct audits to determine the legal status of their residents, and in February, HUD Secretary Scott Turner ceased enforcement of the Equal Access Rule, which required HUD-funded programs and shelters to determine eligibility based on a person’s self-identified gender.
“It’s time to get rid of all the far-left gender ideology and get government out of the way of what the Lord established from the beginning when he created man in his own image — male and female,” Turner said during the announcement. He also said there was “more to come” to ensure taxpayer dollars were being spent appropriately.
The point-in-time report shows that Connecticut has a small population of unhoused people who identified as transgender or gender nonconforming — about 20. Research shows that the LGBTQ population is more likely to experience homelessness.
Most of the increase in the homeless population came from people who are living outside, in their cars or in places not meant for human habitation. That number jumped by 45% to more than 800 people.
The largest population was adults without children, and some of the notable increases were among the older population. There was a 20% increase in people ages 55-64 and a 33% increase in those 64 and older, according to the report.
Providers have said for months that they’ve seen an increasing population of seniors who are losing their housing because of rising rents.
“There’s been a massive spike in the amount of dollars that the agencies have to put in” to house people, said Jim Bombaci, vice president of operations at Nutmeg Consulting, the agency that created the report. “Every dollar more that they put to keep a person in a unit is a dollar less they have to house a new person.”
It’s also hard for people experiencing homelessness to find a place to live because of the lack of affordable housing in Connecticut, experts said, which means that people are staying in shelters longer.
As the number of people experiencing homelessness and the lengths of stays have risen, homelessness has become a point of more political focus in the past couple of years, with lawmakers and advocates asking for more money for homelessness services in the budget and the formation of the bipartisan Homelessness Caucus.
Just over 800 people who were in some type of shelter, living outside or in a supportive housing program, in 2025 were also in the system in 2024, showing that it can be difficult for people to obtain housing and to stay housed once they find a place, Bombaci said.
“We can start to identify these people and figure out who they are, why do they keep getting recounted in the same environment from one year to the next, what interventions are failing, what interventions are working?” Bombaci said.
The report notes that even though the number of shelter beds in the state has increased, there are still not enough to meet the need.
After concerted efforts from the state’s Department of Housing and the homelessness service provider system, the number of children without a place to live has dropped significantly, according to the report.
There were about 590 children experiencing homelessness in January, compared to about 680 in 2024, according to the report.
In the past year, the Department of Housing launched a Head Start on Housing program that pairs rental aid with access to early care and education. Fox said the program had helped cut down on the number of kids without a place to live.
“I think what this reflects is when investments are made, they work,” said Jessica Kubicki, chief initiative officer at the Housing Collective in Fairfield County. “The challenge is, these investments have to be made to scale to actually what the inflow is.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0202_SR_Unhoused_115-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

Read this story in English.
El mapa de el “gancho de langosta” del 5º Distrito sobrevive en un mapa recomendado por un perito judicial, adoptado por la Corte Suprema tras el Censo de 2020.
Estados Unidos asiste a una inusual carrera de redistribución de distritos, instigada a mediados de la década por un presidente ansioso por preservar la frágil mayoría de su partido en la Cámara de Representantes de EE. UU., en las elecciones intermedias del próximo año.
Texas rediseñó su mapa del Congreso con el objetivo declarado de elegir a cinco Republicanos más para el Congreso el próximo año. California está respondiendo con un esfuerzo para hacer lo mismo a favor de los Demócratas. Ahora, Missouri se está uniendo al Partido Republicano.
¿Dónde terminará esto?
Bueno, no en Connecticut.
Los Demócratas controlan dos tercios de los escaños en la Asamblea General y la oficina del Gobernador, pero no pueden dibujar unilateralmente mapas más favorables ni en los distritos congresionales, ni en los legislativos estatales. E incluso si pudieran, los Demócratas ya controlan los cinco escaños del Congreso.
Un efecto secundario de que Texas le entregará al presidente Donald J. Trump un mapa del Congreso a medida es un revuelo —bueno, más bien desinformación— en redes sociales sobre si el mapa Demócrata de Connecticut es producto de la misma política agresiva que vemos en Texas, California y Missouri.
Así funciona realmente la redistribución de distritos en Connecticut, cómo la delegación del Congreso pasó de 60% Republicano a 80% Demócrata en las elecciones intermedias de 2006, y por qué algunos creen ver un “gancho de langosta” en el mapa del Congreso.
¿Es la ausencia de Republicanos de Connecticut en el Congreso una prueba de manipulación de distritos electorales?
No, aunque el mapa del Congreso actual presenta fallas, si se compara con los principios de la redistribución de distritos, como hacer que un distrito sea lo más compacto posible. Y tiene poco sentido hoy en día, a menos que se entiendan sus orígenes y cómo se elaboró.
Pero no fue una manipulación de distritos electorales Demócrata. De hecho, inicialmente favoreció a los Republicanos.
La base del mapa actual son los cambios radicales impuestos por el Censo del 2000, cuando Connecticut perdió uno de sus seis escaños en la Cámara de Representantes de EE. UU. Desde entonces, solo ha sufrido ligeros ajustes tras los resultados de los censos de 2010 y 2020.
El Demócrata James Maloney de Danbury, quien representó al 5.º Distrito, y la Republicana Nancy Johnson de New Britain, quien representó al 6.º Distrito, que pronto desaparecería, terminaron en el mismo distrito en 2002.
El nuevo 5º Distrito se diseñó no tanto para servir a los intereses de los votantes sino a los de Maloney y Johnson. El objetivo era establecer una competencia justa, lo que requirió vaciar el otrora compacto 1er Distrito del Gran Hartford.
Johnson ganó en 2002. De hecho, los Republicanos ganaron tres de los cinco escaños en 2002 y 2004. Los Demócratas dieron la vuelta en el 5º y el 2º distrito en 2006, aprovechando la impopularidad de George W. Bush y la guerra en Irak.
Completaron la victoria en 2008, conquistando el 4º distrito en el condado de Fairfield, gracias al éxito de Barack Obama.
Johnson y Maloney hace tiempo que se alejaron de la política activa. La incómoda frontera entre el 1º y el 5º distrito —el gancho de langosta— persiste.
¿Por qué rara vez se dibujan los mapas del Congreso a mediados de la década?
El impulso suele ser igualar la población de los distritos congresionales tras la finalización de un censo en un decenio, y no reaccionar ante la posibilidad de que un partido pierda la Cámara de Representantes en las próximas elecciones.
Asignar escaños en el Congreso según la población es un juego de suma cero. El número de escaños en la Cámara de Representantes se mantiene constante en 435, y los tribunales han dictaminado que cada distrito debe tener aproximadamente la misma población, en la medida de lo posible.
Esto significa que el mayor crecimiento poblacional en los Estados del Sur y del Oeste desplazó el poder político. El Censo del 2000 dio como resultado que Arizona, Florida, Georgia y Texas obtuvieran dos escaños en la Cámara, y California, Colorado, Nevada y Carolina del Norte, uno.
Nueva York y Pensilvania perdieron dos. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Misisipi, Ohio, Oklahoma y Wisconsin perdieron uno.
¿Quién dibuja los mapas en Connecticut?
En algunos Estados, obtener el control de la legislatura significa que un partido se encarga de dibujar el mapa. No es así en Connecticut. La constitución estatal asigna la tarea a un comité legislativo de ocho personas con igual número de Republicanos y Demócratas en la Cámara y el Senado.
Si no llegan a un acuerdo sobre un mapa, los legisladores deben elegir a ocho miembros para una nueva comisión de redistribución de distritos. Esos ocho miembros deben entonces ponerse de acuerdo para elegir a un noveno miembro. Si esto no genera consenso, la tarea de trazar nuevos distritos recae en la Corte Suprema del Estado.
Cada 10 años, los legisladores tienen pocos problemas para negociar nuevos distritos legislativos estatales. Sin embargo, se han estancado en la realización de cambios al mapa del Congreso.
Como resultado, la revisión del mapa del Congreso después de los censos de 2010 y 2020 se delegó en la Corte Suprema y un perito judicial designado por el tribunal, quienes solo han realizado los cambios mínimos necesarios para igualar la población de los cinco distritos.
Justificación del tribunal: El mapa elaborado tras el Censo del 2000 fue imparcial, y corresponde a la Asamblea General realizar cambios más significativos.
Por cierto, el software cartográfico ha facilitado considerablemente el trazado de nuevos distritos.

Si no son los mapas, ¿cómo se explican los resultados desiguales que favorecen a los Demócratas?
La respuesta son las cifras y las tendencias.
Primero, las cifras. Solo el 21 % de los votantes registrados son Republicanos, en comparación con el 36 % de Demócratas y el 42 % de no afiliados. Los suburbios adinerados que en un día fueron la base del Partido Republicano, especialmente en el condado de Fairfield, se han inclinado hacia el Partido Demócrata, al igual que algunos suburbios obreros se han inclinado hacia el Partido Republicano.
Esta tendencia se aceleró desde la elección de Trump.
Los Republicanos cayeron a su mínimo histórico en 2008, cuando la popularidad de Obama ayudó a los Demócratas a obtener mayorías de 114-37 en la Cámara de Representantes Estatal y de 24-12 en el Senado Estatal. El Partido Republicano fue ganando terreno de forma constante, quedándose a las puertas de la mayoría en la Cámara y ganando un empate de 18-18 en el Senado.
De hecho, al Partido Republicano le fue bien con Trump encabezando la votación en 2016, a pesar de que perdió estrepitosamente en el Estado: los Republicanos ganaron un empate de 18-18 en el Senado Estatal y se quedaron a cuatro escaños de la mayoría en la Cámara.
Pero todas las elecciones desde la victoria de Trump han sido un problema para los Republicanos. El mismo mapa legislativo que casi produjo la paridad en 2016 dio a los Demócratas amplias mayorías en 2018 y 2020.

Currently, the state’s minimum wage is $14.65, but the Maine Department of Labor announced Thursday the 45 cent increase that will take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The “tip wage,” or the minimum wage for service employees, will increase to $7.55 per hour. 
This is a slightly smaller jump than the 50 cent increase the state saw between 2024 and 2025. 
Per Maine law and a 2016 citizens referendum, the state is required to make an annual adjustment based on the cost-of-living index for the Northeast Region. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, there was a 3.1% increase in the cost-of-living index between August 2024 and last month. 
For the first time, the state’s minimum wage will pertain to agricultural workers since Gov. Janet Mills signed a law in June that now guarantees them the right.
An estimated 35,000 workers in Maine were paid hourly and received less than $15 an hour in 2024, according to the Current Population Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The cities of Portland and Rockland have their own minimum wages, which are typically higher than the state’s. Both cities usually update their minimum wage based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, so their rate for 2025 is $15.50.
However, Portland City Council voted last month to place a question on the November ballot asking residents if they’d like to raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 an hour over the next three years. If approved, the rate would jump to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027, and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage would keep pace with cost of living increases.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Thursday unanimously voted to consider an Advisory Opinion Request from a state lawmaker concerning candidate bank accounts. 
In a written request from Rep. Judd Strom, R-Copan, dated Sept. 9, the lawmaker asked the Commission to clarify a rule regarding bank accounts for candidate contribution holdings. The current rule, as he said he understands it, requires a candidate or officeholder to close their current bank account, open a new one and transfer carry-over funds with each new election cycle, even when running for reelection of the same office. 
“I have found the action to be cumbersome, be confusing, and possibly lead to the unintended consequence of observers being misled by the transfer of funds,” Strom wrote. 
The commission is expected to hear public feedback on a preliminary, written opinion at its Nov. 13 meeting. A draft of the opinion must be issued at least five days prior to the public hearing. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said several lawmakers have pointed to this rule as a point of confusion. 
Many officeholders seek reelection and run for office multiple election cycles in a row, she said. The question is can candidates have one bank account stay open, rather than open a new account and transfer campaign funds every election cycle, Bruce Boone said. 
“We definitely want to keep things transparent and accountable, but we also don’t want to miss the forest for the trees and make things so difficult, either,” she said.

(Courtesy of NMILC) On Sept. 8, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a ban on federal immigration agents’ racial profiling practices of Spanish-speaking workers in Southern California. The decision prompted swift rebuke from New Mexico’s congressional delegation and Attorney General Raúl Torrez, who noted in a statement that the New Mexico Constitution protects people from “racial profiling by state, county and municipal law enforcement.” A few days later, Source New Mexico sat down with Zoe Bowman, the managing attorney of the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center’s asylum and detention team, to talk about the recent decision and other issues facing immigrants in the state.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: How do you anticipate the SCOTUS ruling on racial profiling will impact New Mexico? 
Bowman: The ruling allows [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to use factors like the color of someone’s skin, the language they’re speaking, their accent, where they are working or just where they are in the community as a reason to arrest or to detain someone. It really emboldens ICE to be able to arrest and detain a lot more people.
We appreciate when our elected officials [take] a stance against collaboration with ICE, especially in cases where it’s unlawful under the New Mexico Constitution.
A new report from the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on Sept. 8 recommended DHS close all three of the state’s detention centers. But Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham left immigration detention off of the special session agenda, saying lawmakers wanted more time in the interim to address it in the January 2026 session. What’s your response?
We recognize this is an urgent issue, but we’re ready to move forward in January [and support] the Immigrant Safety Act [which passed the state Legislature’s House of Representatives in the most recent session].
We know that more and more New Mexico residents are being caught up in the web of ICE enforcement and detention. This issue is only getting more urgent, more important, as ICE continues to threaten the safety and well being of New Mexico communities. That pressure is going to translate for lawmakers in New Mexico and in the upcoming legislative session in January, and we’re feeling hopeful we can pass it this year.
What does NMILC consider an emerging threat in immigration and detention in New Mexico?
New Mexico has a majority of people of color. This Supreme Court decision not only threatens the rights and the safety of people who are undocumented, but is really expansive and opens up more people to ICE enforcement actions. We’re very concerned about that and believe that justice shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or the language that you speak.
This decision weakens a core constitutional protection in the Fourth Amendment, that protects everyone from unreasonable searches and detentions. It weakens protection, not just for folks who are undocumented, but for all of us.

Raphael Warnock, pictured at a May town hall, is proposing a system of commissary coupons to help junior enlisted servicemembers access healthy meals more easily as part of Congress' annual defense bill. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderService members could have easier access to healthy meals under a bipartisan proposal introduced Thursday by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock.
The Commissary Healthy Options and servicemember Wellness Act – or the CHOW Act – introduced by Warnock and Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, creates a limited year-long pilot program to give junior enlisted servicemembers a monthly credit to use at on-base commissaries. The senators are hoping to incorporate it into the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which is expected to make its way through the Senate next week.
“For too long, service members have not had their dollars stretch far enough, and have lacked access to good, quality, nutritious food, which is basic,” Warnock said in a phone interview. “Our service members are the best among us. They shouldn’t be struggling with anything that resembles food insecurity. We need them to be ready and healthy and not have to resort to unhealthy alternatives.”
As proposed, the amendment directs the Department of Defense to administer the program starting at two bases, to be selected by the department. The bill instructs the department to choose the bases based on factors including low satisfaction with dining halls, large numbers of enlisted members living in barracks with access to kitchens and commissaries that are “experimenting with or expanding their selection of nutritious and minimally processed ready-made and easy-to-make food options.”
The amount of the coupons and other details will also be managed by the DOD.
Warnock said he’s hopeful the pilot will be a success and Congress will expand the program nationwide.
The effort comes after Warnock led an inquiry into the military’s spending on food and nutrition quality.
Commissaries are grocery stores on military installations that offer fresh food and packaged meals at a discount to service members and their families. Often, whether for convenience or cost, service members turn to fast food or snacks instead of more wholesome meals.
“Very often their allowance doesn’t go far enough,” Warnock said. “And let’s face it, we’re all witnessing this with the inflation that we are seeing, things cost more. Service members don’t live in a world that’s detached from the world that the rest of us live in. They live in that same world.”
A 2023 report by the American Security Project, a military think tank, found that about 70% of all active-duty service members are overweight, and 21% are obese, according to the Military Times.
Warnock said he hopes the new food benefit will boost morale and help increase readiness by ensuring troops are healthy and fit.
“How you eat impacts how you feel,” he said. “All of us have had those days – maybe not for lack of resources, it could simply be that you’re busy – when you’re not eating well, you’re just dragging through the day, and it’s because your nutrition is out of order. And we can ill afford to have that be the case for our service members.”
The U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of the defense bill Wednesday with only 17 Democrats voting for it.

John Diehl, a former speaker of the Missouri House who was forced to resign in disgrace in 2015 when it was revealed he’d been sending sexually inappropriate text messages to an intern, pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal wire fraud charge. 
Diehl, a Republican from Town and Country, was released on his own recognizance Thursday pending a Dec. 19 sentencing hearing.
Federal prosecutors say Diehl admitted to applying for a loan through a federal program designed to help struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and using the money to make payments on a Tesla, an Audi and a Jeep, along with pool maintenance, country-club dues, mortgage bills and college tuition for a family member. 
All total, Diehl admitted to defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration out of $379,900.
Wire fraud is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine or both.  Diehl’s attorney said Thursday that his client has repaid the loan proceeds to the United States Treasury.
Diehl was arguably the state’s most powerful politician in 2015 when the Kansas City Star revealed he’d been sending sexually inappropriate messages to a 19-year-old House intern. While he initially refused to step down, he eventually resigned when it became clear he’d lost the support of key members of his party.
After his political career ended, he laid low for years before reemerging in 2018 to advocate for a company he co-owned that was hoping to mine cobalt in the Bootheel.
He later became embroiled in controversy in Independence, when the FBI began scrutinizing a contract to demolish the power plant in Missouri City owned by Independence Power & Light. Diehl was attorney for the company that won the contract despite bidding twice as much as the other company seeking the job.
A federal grand jury issued subpoenas to Independence to obtain a number of records related to the two utility deals, including minutes to private meetings held by the Independence City Council where the transactions were discussed. Additionally, numerous city officials were interviewed by federal law enforcement.
A Kansas City businessman named Joseph Campbell who was connected to the utility contract testified under oath that the FBI questioned him about Diehl, whom he accused of trying to create a fake attorney-client relationship in order to keep from having to hand over certain documents the government had requested through a subpoena.
Through an attorney, Diehl denied the accusation at the time. No criminal charges have been filed in connection to the Independence contracts.
In 2023, Diehl was fined $47,000 by the Missouri Ethics Commission for allegedly misusing campaign funds.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diehl-and-gavel-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-09-11 14:57:11.934629

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-11 17:56:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,"‘A really good guess’: Jackson city officials, lacking confidence in the numbers, pass $337 million budget",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/11/a-really-good-guess-jackson-city-officials-lacking-confidence-in-the-numbers-pass-337-million-budget/,Jackson officials passed a level budget Wednesday while expressing uncertainty in the financial figures due to the city’s failure to maintain annual audits — something many cities and towns across Mississippi struggle to execute.,"A half hour into Jackson’s final budget meeting Wednesday, Councilmember Vernon Hartley wanted to know if — out of the hundreds of millions of dollars the city council was poised to pass in the annual budget — the city could allocate $2.5 million to blight control equipment. 
Pieter Teeuwissen, the chief administrative officer, leaned down from the dais to speak with one of his employees before offering a counter: That would work if Hartley dropped the number by a million. 
“No sir,” Hartley said.
Then Teeuwissen explained his hesitation: Like many officials in the council chambers, he lacked confidence in the accuracy of the city’s proposed budget book. 
“All this is numbers that none of us are willing to build our own financial houses on,” he said. “So I don’t want you allocating money beyond what my finance people say they are comfortable with.”
The uncertainty stems from the city’s failure to keep up with its audited financial statements — something many cities and towns across Mississippi struggle to execute. This concern led Mayor John Horhn’s administration to recommend the Jackson City Council adopt a generally flat budget this year. 
On Wednesday, the council passed the roughly $337 million budget, up from $325 million last year, Teeuwissen said, a difference that is due to the infusion of one-time funds, not substantial growth in the city’s general fund.

Hartley ended up dropping his proposal by a million as Teeuwissen asked. Other changes the council made to Horhn’s proposed budget included amendments from Councilman Kenneth Stokes to give a discretionary raise for the lowest-paid city employees and add an additional $1 million to the police and fire departments after the city completes the back-due audits. One proposal that failed would have forced the administration to pay the zoo’s water bills.
“We need to show some money in this budget that’s just not fluff, not just some money in the sky that ain’t there,” Stokes said. 
Council President Brian Grizzell said after the meeting that due to the late audits, the council does not know how much money the city has in its fund balance. He described his level of confidence in the budget he had just passed as “moderate” and added he hoped to have more time to look at the numbers next year. 
“We haven’t passed an audit since I’ve been in office,” Grizzell said. “It’s always just been a really good guess.” 
To remedy that, Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today the mayor also hopes to consolidate some of the city’s 11 departments starting Oct. 1, when the new budget takes effect. 
The administration said the mergers, which will include reducing the number of city employees, will help in the event that the budget changes once the city’s audited financial statements are complete. 
“The main thing Jacksonians need to know is that — I’m trying to choose my words carefully — the city, the administration has proposed to the council a flat budget in light of the lack of audited financial data,” Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today. “It is also likely that the city budget will have to decrease during the fiscal year as audited numbers are received now.” 
To complicate matters, the audited financial statements will not answer every question facing the city’s budget, Teeuwissen said.
Take, for instance, longrunning concerns about the impact Jackson’s dwindling population will have on its tax base. Officials do not know the extent to which Jackson is missing out on revenue due to potentially low property tax collection rates, even as the city property tax revenues grew by $2 million to $68 million this year, according to Fidelis Malembeka, the chief financial officer. 
“You might lose population, but somebody’s property values still increase,” Malembeka said after the meeting. 
Overall, the city’s revenues fell by about $8 million from last year to $316 million, Malembeka said, mainly due to a decline in one-time funding. Revenue generally includes permits and fees, sales tax, grants and non-recurring funding such as the Siemens settlement.
If the administration truly lacked confidence in the city’s budget figures, they would have taken more drastic action than proposing a level budget, said Tina Clay, a council member who represents northwest Jackson.
“If that was the case you need to freeze everything until you get the audit,” she told Mississippi Today.

Teeuwissen said the administration will be focusing on sensibly organizing city government, such as reinstituting monthly meetings with department-level fiscal officers, reviewing the finance department’s recordkeeping methods and moving services so they fall within the same department. 
“Right now, we do grass-cutting by contract, grass-cutting by community improvement and grass-cutting by Parks and Rec, and we’re supposed to have right-of-way maintenance by Public Works,” he said. “Three different departments and contractors all supposedly doing some version of the same thing but we really don’t have the left hand knowing what the right hand is doing.” 
The council on Tuesday passed a resolution supporting the mayor’s goal of consolidating and merging departments. Another way the city is attempting to coordinate efforts around infrastructure projects is an agreement approved Tuesday to share resources between the city and county, Clarion Ledger reported.
Parkinson told Mississippi Today he was relieved to know that the budget is not the end-all, be-all of the city’s spending power, as it can receive more revenue throughout the year in one-time payments, such as a $1 million grant the council accepted Tuesday from Jackson State University for beautification.

“I think there’s many people, myself being one of them, that says as much as we want to re-examine everything from the ground up, I don’t know if we can start with a blank sheet of paper in a couple of months and meet the deadline that we have legally,” Parkinson said. 
The city’s budget needed to be finalized before Sept. 15. Over the past week, council members heard budget requests from individual city departments. Some of the needs included helping the community improvement division tackle blight, such as streetlights that are out across the city, improving police technology and purchasing new patrol vehicles, and reopening the Sykes Community Center. 
But moves like that depend on coordination across the system — which, an exchange toward the end of the council meeting illustrated, is lacking in Jackson. 
In an effort to help the legal department, which was considering moving buildings due to HVAC issues, Foote proposed the city put an additional $1 million into the fund for the care and maintenance of public buildings. 
Then Foote learned from Sharon Thames, the deputy chief financial officer, that Jackson already has $710,000 for HVAC repairs set aside in a different fund, one that’s for the “repair and replacement” of city infrastructure. 
Thames explained the monies weren’t listed in the budget book where Foote had looked.
“I mean, this is crazy, people are packing up and getting ready to move when we have money in our budget,” Foote responded. “We’re not communicating well across the system if the money is there, and then we’re being told by the legal department they have to move out because the money to fix their HVAC isn’t there?”
“I mean, to kind of answer your question on the legal (department), that building belongs to JRA (Jackson Redevelopment Authority), not to the city of Jackson,” Thames said. 
“JRA belongs to the city of Jackson,” Foote shot back. Clay shook her head and other council members laughed. 
“Well, yeah, but they don’t like to share their money,” Thames quipped.
(JRA Director Christopher Pike told Mississippi Today Thursday that his agency, a partner to the city, deploys its funding on programming and building maintenance — it’s not as much a matter of not sharing as it is having limited resources — and that it stands ready to assist with these concerns).
Teeuwissen chimed in. 
“As a practical matter I’m with you,” he said to Foote. “If that money was available, that should have been clear so y’all could decide how to address the problem or how to proceed.”
“Somebody in the chain of command needs to know there’s $750,000,” Foote said.

SC State has not received any direct threats, spokesman Sam Watson said, but the school has heightened security as a precaution. Security personnel stationed at campus entrances are checking photo IDs of students, employees and visitors before allowing people to enter.
Watson called this “standard operating procedure” for the school any time there is a potential safety risk.
The school is instructing students and staff to report any suspicious activity to the campus Public Safety office at 803-536-7188.
In other states, some schools are locking down their campuses and cancelling classes in response to threats.
Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana went on lockdown Thursday morning, citing “a potential threat to campus safety,” according to the Louisiana Illuminator, a States Newsroom affiliate. The school asked members of the public not to enter campus until further notice.
Lockdowns also have been confirmed at other HBCUs including:

Alabama State University, which told USA TODAY it had received “terrorist threats”
Clark Atlanta University
Bethune-Cookman University, in Daytona Beach, Florida
Hampton State University, in Virginia
Spelman College, in Atlanta

,DC,2025-09-11 17:48:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump Education Department to divert grants from colleges serving students of color,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-education-department-divert-grants-colleges-serving-students-color,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education announced it will withhold $350 million of congressionally approved funds to minority-serving colleges and universities and divert the funds elsewhere, saying that the institutions’ admissions quotas are discriminatory.  The move eliminated fiscal 2025 discretionary funding for institutions that serve students who are Asian, Black, Indigenous and Hispanic, as well as a program for students of color pursuing careers in science and engineering. It’s consistent with President Donald Trump’s longstanding objective to eliminate programs that center on diversity, equity and inclusion.“To further our commitment to ending discrimination in all forms across federally supported programs, the Department will no longer award Minority-Serving Institution grants that discriminate by restricting eligibility to institutions that meet government-mandated racial quotas,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.McMahon cited a July opinion from the U.S. Justice Department that it was unconstitutional for federal funds to go to Hispanic-serving institutions based on the student body makeup.That opinion reversed a decades-long record of the federal government setting aside funding for higher education institutions that have a significant portion of students from racial or ethnic minority backgrounds. The schools affected by Wednesday’s announcement are Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions; Black institutions; Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions; Native American-serving nontribal institutions; and institutions receiving Minority Science and Engineering Improvement grants. The announcement was vague about where the money would go instead, saying only it would be diverted “into programs that do not include discriminatory racial and ethnic quotas and that advance Administration priorities.”Up to 800 schools affectedDemocrats swiftly condemned the move, which is likely to face legal challenges.Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the ranking member on the U.S. House Education and Workforce Committee, said in a statement that the move undercut efforts to help students of color reach financial stability.“These institutions are effective engines of economic mobility because they meet students where they are and are dedicated to educating the whole person,” Scott said in a statement.Roughly 5 million students are enrolled in the more than 800 minority-serving institutions across the country. The schools aim to help students of color and students from low-income backgrounds pursue higher education. Most of the minority-serving schools receive funding based on racial quotas, except for Black institutions and tribal colleges, whose designations are based on their historical missions to educate Black or Native American students.The Department of Education will also reprogram funds from a program to develop Hispanic-serving institutions and from a program promoting postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans.McMahon argued that because most minority-serving institutions require that a percentage of the student body reflect the racial background the institutions serve, it violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protections. Administration cites equal protectionsMcMahon pointed to the Justice Department’s July memo saying it would not defend a suit brought by the state of Tennessee against Hispanic-serving institutions. The Supreme Court has explained that ‘[o]utright racial balancing’ is ‘patently unconstitutional,’” U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson. “And its precedents make clear that the government lacks any legitimate interest in differentiating among universities based on whether ‘a specified number of seats in each class’ are occupied by ‘individuals from the preferred ethnic groups,’” Sauer wrote.The U.S. Supreme Court case that Sauer cited in his letter to Johnson is the 2023 decision to strike down affirmative action in college admissions that found two prominent universities’ consideration of race in acceptances violated the U.S. Constitution.Most minority-serving institutions, about 70%, are Hispanic-serving institutions, according to Rutgers University’s Center for Minority Serving Institutions.David Mendez, the head of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, an advocacy group, said in a statement that the loss in funding is “an attack on equity in higher education.”“Cutting this funding strips away critical investments in under-resourced and first-generation students and will destabilize colleges in 29 states,” Mendez said. “The funds granted to HSIs have never supported only Latino students. These funds strengthen entire campuses, creating opportunities and resources that benefit all students, especially those pursuing (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, as well as enhancing the communities where these colleges and universities are located.”",,,,2025-09-11 13:58:05.375406

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Energy overcharged state agencies by $2 million on 2024 energy bills — more than double initial estimates —  according to a new state audit published on Sept. 5. 
The 13-page report by Andrew Manca, chief of internal audits with the Rhode Island Office of Internal Audit and Program Integrity comes as state utility regulators deepen their own review of potentially more widespread billing errors by Rhode Island Energy.
“At this point, one of my concerns is that we don’t fully understand what the problem was, or how many people it affects,” Todd Bianco, chief economic and policy analyst for the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC), said in an interview Thursday. 
Flooded by customer complaints alleging artificially high winter energy bills, including from state government administrators, the PUC in May ordered Rhode Island Energy to  hire a consultant to probe for evidence of billing inaccuracies. Last week, the PUC authorized a contract with Virginia-based professional services firm Guidehouse, Inc.  — one of three firms to respond to Rhode Island Energy’s request for proposals. An initial kickoff meeting between parties was held Wednesday, Bianco said.
The cost of the Guidehouse contract has not been made public.
Under state regulators’ directives, Guidehouse has until Nov. 15 to report results of its own audit into Rhode Island Energy’s billing practices. Manca’s report, which exclusively covers the 2,250 Rhode Island Energy electric and gas accounts held by the state government, will be incorporated into Guidehouse’s review of other commercial and residential customers.
And if the state review is any indicator, the problem may be more pervasive than anticipated. In July, state auditors identified overcharges of roughly $1 million. The deeper dive revealed state agencies were actually overbilled by over $2 million, according to the audit report.
The primary cause identified by the state was the transition from a legacy billing system inherited when PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, bought the state’s electric and gas operations from National Grid in 2022. 
During the transition to a new billing software, bills from August through October 2024 failed to credit the state for excess renewable electricity it generated. Under the typical net metering bill practice, customers with solar panels, wind turbines or other renewable energy systems receive future bill credits for any energy they produce beyond what they personally use, and return to the electric grid. 
Overcharges to Rhode Island state government have been mostly rectified, with the state using the credits toward its regular, monthly bills.  Payments on gas and electric bills resumed in June and August, respectively, according to Manca’s report.
A single state gas account remains outstanding, having not been identified for overcharges in the data initially provided by Rhode Island Energy, Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration, confirmed via email Thursday.
‘Most unique customer’
Rhode Island Energy did not dispute the findings.
“Rhode Island Energy has been transparent and cooperative throughout the State’s audit process,” Michael Dalo, a spokesperson, said in a statement Thursday. “The State of Rhode Island is our largest and most unique customer, with over 2,000 bills from separate state entities consolidated into one. The timing issues identified through this audit were primarily the result of system changes during our transition from National Grid’s legacy platforms. We have addressed these issues, implemented corrective actions, and continue to strengthen our billing systems and processes. We remain committed to accuracy, accountability, and working closely with state partners to ensure reliable service.”
But the state audit doesn’t offer much reassurance that future errors won’t occur, or will be easily detected if they do. Manca highlighted the lack of automation and account mislabeling as systemic problems.
“The State of Rhode Island bears the burden of ensuring billing accuracy,” he concluded. These manual corrections introduce inefficiencies, increase administrative workload, and increase the potential for errors during invoicing.”
Bianco acknowledged that the state is a more complex customer than a typical household or business, with multiple buildings and accounts, along with separate, third-party suppliers for some of its energy. He was unsure whether the problems identified were isolated to the state, to large commercial accounts, or perhaps to net metering customers.
“There’s concern that the billing system did not perform, and other customers might have been impacted,” Bianco said.

The renewable energy wind project Revolution Wind was 80% complete when Trump halted its construction. 
On August 22, 2025, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order, citing national security concerns, although it did not identify any legal violation or threat to safety. At the time, all offshore foundations had been completed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines were installed.
The project began construction in Rhode Island in 2023 and was expected to start commercial operations next year, delivering enough electricity to power 350,000 homes in New England, according to Connecticut’s Department of Environmental Protection.
A DEEP preliminary analysis estimates a loss of the project could increase the cost of electricity for businesses and residents across New England by 5% to 7%.
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the development companies have sued the Trump administration over the wind farm stop-work order.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner).Wisconsin leaders condemned political violence and said they are continuing to discuss security in the Capitol on Thursday following the assassination of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.
Kirk, a conservative activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed Wednesday while speaking at a university event in Orem, Utah. The search is still underway for the shooter.
During a floor session Thursday, the Wisconsin State Assembly held a moment of silence for Kirk as well as one to honor the 24th anniversary of 9/11.
“Mr. Kirk’s family are in our thoughts today,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said at a press conference. “We are still sad about the assassination of Representative Melissa Horton in Minnesota. Political violence and violence is never the answer — whether it’s the arson attack on Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home, the attempt on President Trump’s life or the university and college shootings that are happening all across our nation. Violence is never the answer.”
Hesselbein also acknowledged the shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado that happened Wednesday afternoon.
“This was another senseless act of political violence unfortunately against Charlie Kirk, and I want to express my deepest condolences to his loved ones,” Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said. “We all condemn political violence in the strongest possible terms. No one should fear for their lives because of their jobs.”
Security and safety concerns have been at the forefront of lawmakers’ minds this year, especially after the assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The names of several Wisconsin politicians were found on a list of targets belonging to the Minnesota shooting suspect.
“Given the recent rise in political violence, of course, this is top of mind for many of our colleagues, and of course, the staff who work in the Capitol as well as the press, the guests, the children that come through this building on Capitol visits,” Neubauer said. “It’s an ongoing conversation, and we hope to continue that with our Republican colleagues, who of course control the safety in our chambers, as well as the other entities in the Capitol.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said he is “very confident” in the Capitol police force and noted that many of the incidents that have occurred were not located in Capitol buildings. 
“When you look at Minnesota, it was in their homes. If you look at what happened yesterday to Charlie Kirk, it was in a public venue on campus, so the idea that we’re somehow going to fortify a single building to make people feel safer when the reality is that most of the violence that has occurred has not been inside of the buildings, but outside of people’s home.
In a video Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump condemned the assassination and listed acts of violence that have occurred against right-leaning figures, including the attempt on his own life last year, but neglected to mention the murder of the Hortmans. He blamed the incidents on “radical left political violence.” 
“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now,” Trump said. “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence.”
Asked about Trump only recognizing violence against conservatives, Vos said he didn’t see the comments. But Vos said he knows that in Trump’s “heart” he believes that “assassination is 100% of the time wrong.”
“When Melissa Hortman, who was clearly a liberal Democrat, I didn’t hear anybody on the right celebrating the fact that she was assassinated. It was awful, and that’s what it should be,” Vos said, adding that he condemned anyone celebrating Kirk’s death.
During the moment of silence, Vos said Kirk was a man “who represented free speech” and “was silenced in the most horrific way possible.” He said that the country is “rapidly deteriorating” as “many see the other party as their mortal enemies out to destroy the country, not just good-hearted political rivals that we should be.”
Wisconsin’s congressional delegation and other state leaders also condemned political violence on Wednesday, though one Republican has taken the route of blaming others for the violence. 
Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said that “there is no two ways about this: political violence has no place in America. I am keeping Charlie and his family in my thoughts in this truly horrifying moment.”
U.S. Rep. Tony Wied called Kirk “a true American Patriot” and said “his legacy will live on for generations to come.” 
“There is absolutely zero place for political violence in our country,” Wied said. 
“Violence against anyone because of their political beliefs is wrong. Violence against others is wrong.  Violence is never the answer for resolving our differences or disagreements,” Gov. Tony Evers said. “Wisconsin joins in praying for Charlie Kirk and the Utah Valley community and first responders.”
U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District, has been posting consistently since news broke about the assassination, blaming reporters and Democrats for the violence. 
“The left and their policies are leading America into a civil war. And they want it,” Van Orden wrote in one post. In another, he said reporters and Democrats were “directly culpable.” 
Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker said in a statement that Van Orden was encouraging violence. 
“His terrifying statements, which are inviting civil war and encouraging violence against Democrats and the media, are being completely ignored by Republicans in Wisconsin and in D.C.. They have a responsibility to tell Derrick Van Orden to stop pouring gasoline on an open flame, and I implore them to do so immediately,” Remiker said.
Remiker had already condemned the violence in a statement Wednesday, saying, “this sort of violence will continue until all of us, regardless of party, condemn these sorts of heinous actions.”

(Justin Haag/Nebraskaland Magazine, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission)LINCOLN – John Ricks, the state tourism director who deployed the edgy and controversial marketing pitch “Nebraska. Honestly, it’s not for everyone,” has resigned.
Ricks, who was paid $133,838-a-year, could not immediately be reached for comment. His resignation was accepted Thursday by the State Tourism Commission, which has since appointed Deputy Director Heather Hogue as interim executive director, as was reported first by the Nebraska Rural Radio Network.
While Ricks got mixed reviews on the tourism pitch, an official with the Nebraska Travel Association said he played a key role in helping increase tourism in the state, citing a 26.4% growth rate in state lodging taxes from 2019-2022 compared to only 2.5% nationally.

“Ricks is to be commended for putting Nebraska on the tourism map,” said Kerri Rempp, president of the state travel association.
Hired in 2016 by then Gov. Pete Ricketts, Ricks had worked as an associate director in Colorado’s state tourism office before taking the Nebraska job. His hiring was touted as bringing a fresh perspective to a state that had been rated by one group as the “least likely” for tourists to visit.
That led to the new “Nebraska: Honestly, it’s not for everyone” marketing pitch, which included advertising emphasizing off-beat adventures in Nebraska, from floating down a river in a horse tank to hop-scotching across Badlands-like formations in Toadstool Park.
The self-deprecating pitch grabbed national attention, and, in 2022, won a national award for best integrated marketing and messaging. According to the State Tourism Commission, it also raised Nebraska’s tourism profile from last to 45th.
But some state leaders, including Gov. Jim Pillen and then Nebraska Department of Economic Development Director Tony Goins, disliked the motto, which was coined by a marketing firm from Colorado. Goins said it “made a mockery” of the DED’s pitchline for new residents: “The Good Life is Calling.”
By 2024, the “not for everyone” tagline was dropped by the Tourism Commission and state legislators passed a bill seeking to better coordinate marketing pitches between the independent commission, also known as “Visit Nebraska” and state economic development officials.
The Nebraska Travel Association, in a press release this week, urged the State Tourism Commission to “act swiftly” to replace Ricks.
The tourism agency is funded by lodging taxes paid on motel and hotel bills. Its budget this year is $10.1 million to promote an industry that generates $4.5 billion in spending annually and supports over 41,000 jobs throughout Nebraska.

Jim Lucas visited the White House on Aug. 26, taking this selfie with a portrait of President Donald Trump at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally after an attempted assassination on the campaign trail. (Photo from Lucas' Facebook)One of Indiana’s first Republican lawmakers to declare opposition to mid-cycle redistricting is “now a rock solid HELL YES.”
Seymour Rep. Jim Lucas announced his reversal on Facebook and X just two weeks after he and his colleagues met with President Donald Trump’s administration on redistricting — and within hours of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Rep. Heath VanNatter, R-Kokomo. (From Indiana House Republicans)
Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census.
Lucas’ endorsement prompted criticism from Kokomo Rep. Heath VanNatter, a fellow member of the Indiana House’s GOP caucus.
“I knew you would fold,” VanNatter wrote. “Maybe you should keep your powder dry next time.”
Lucas replied that he “made a damn good case” against redistricting and “stand(s) by” his position at the time. He previously called the idea “highly unusual and politically optically horrible,” and pushed for electoral wins “the old-fashioned way.”
But after the D.C. trip and Kirk’s death, Lucas explained, “I have ZERO problem to publicly come out and explain my changed position.”
VanNatter responded by quoting Lucas’ own words — “hard no” and “dangerous precedent” — back at him, adding, “I assumed that meant that you opposed (mid-cycle redistricting) but I guess I don’t know what those words mean.”
He mocked Lucas’ phrasing and called the change “a real weird and quick flip flop.”
VanNatter hasn’t made his own position explicit, however.
Lucas didn’t respond. Instead, on Thursday morning, he posted a lengthy explanation of his reasoning to Facebook.
It wasn’t the killings of Kirk in Utah or a Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, he wrote. Instead, it was his own back surgery.
Republican senators silent after closed-door redistricting caucus

Lucas lauded the Indiana Spine Hospital for being physician-owned and patient-focused at lower prices: “THIS is the way healthcare should be.”
If Democrats take control of the House, he wrote, “places like this might go under” and the rest of Trump’s reforms “will be dead in the water.”
“We owe it to ourselves and future generations to give Trump this reform possibility, because the status quo from both parties is destroying America,” Lucas concluded. “THAT is why I’m a hell yes on redistricting.”
Hoosier House Republicans met to discuss mid-cycle redistricting in mid-August and are set to meet again virtually on Friday. Their Senate counterparts caucused Wednesday.
Pro-redistricting texts sent by the conservative-leaning Forward America started going out again this week, even as a coalition of voting-rights advocates delivered a stack of nearly 9,000 signatures from anti-redistricting Hoosiers.
Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Braun has pointed out blue states with gerrymandered maps but has refused to take a firm stance on the topic. He is waiting for legislative leadership to indicate if a special session should be called.

(Image courtesy of the Environmental Protection Agency)While the state legislature passes laws on underground carbon sequestration, researchers are analyzing how lessons learned from wastewater injection-induced earthquakes could inform the growing carbon storage industry.


Researchers and companies in the U.S. are investigating ways to store huge amounts of carbon dioxide underground. The greenhouse gas contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, prompting some to develop technology to capture it and inject it into the earth.
A new article analyzing cases of induced seismicity in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and New Mexico, published in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, said carbon storage is critical to limiting the effects of climate change.
“But if it’s associated with induced seismicity, then I think it will really undermine public support for those activities,” said study author and Stanford University Professor Emeritus Mark Zoback.
The risk of triggering earthquakes by injecting carbon underground in certain geological formations has been known for decades, researchers say. Areas with hard and brittle rocks are more likely to be unsuitable for injection.
Zoback said he and co-author Peter Hennings, a research professor at the University of Texas, used wastewater injection as an analogy to explain what could happen with large-scale carbon storage. Captured carbon is converted into a supercritical fluid, which is similar to a liquid, for underground storage.
The paper analyzed some of Oklahoma’s series of earthquakes from the 2010s that were confirmed to be caused by oil and gas operations. Zoback said the affected area isn’t suitable for high amounts of carbon storage.
“ In north-central Oklahoma, one should not be doing large-scale carbon storage in the Arbuckle formation because we’ve done that experiment, we know what happens,” he said. “Now, that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to store CO2, for example, in depleted oil and gas reservoirs.”
At least two companies have submitted applications to store carbon underground in Oklahoma as of late August. CapturePoint withdrew its bid to operate carbon wells in Osage County in January after the Environmental Protection Agency indicated it needed more information about the site’s geology and potential for seismicity, a spokesperson for the company said.
Another company, NexGen Carbon Solutions, applied this summer to operate 10 carbon wells in Osage County. In an announcement, it said it planned to store 72 million tons of carbon over 20 years in the wells. The EPA application is currently in a technical review.
To welcome carbon companies, the state legislature passed a bill laying out rules for local regulation of carbon storage wells, known as Class VI under the EPA. At the time of passage, the state planned to ask the federal government for primacy to oversee and regulate its commercial wells.
“This is probably the most important piece of legislation you’ll see this year for future economic development in the state of Oklahoma,” bill co-author Rep. Ken Luttrell (R-Ponca City) said during a May 1 House floor session. “These companies are willing to come to Oklahoma and invest millions of dollars in our economy with these Class VI wells.”
Zoback and Hennings wrote that they want the research paper to serve as a guide for the public to understand the body of information on carbon storage and the risk of earthquakes. Zoback said public perception of underground carbon injection is key to putting away millions of tons of the greenhouse gas.
“ The biggest threat in many cases will not be the shaking of the ground, but will be undermining public confidence that it can go forward safely,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of NBC 12)Less than a month after opening for the new school year, two Virginia HBCUs —  Virginia State and Hampton Universities  — closed on Thursday after receiving threats to their campuses.
Though neither school has released details on what the threats entail, attention on campus safety has been heightened nationwide after the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.
In the past few years, Virginia’s institutions including Virginia State (VSU) and Hampton Universities have navigated multiple threats, some of which ended in no activity or followed after gun violence while others were found to be unsubstantiated.
“The safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors remain our highest priority,” Hampton University said in a statement Thursday morning, adding that further updates will be provided by the end of the day.
Hampton said in a statement that it received notice of a “potential threat” and has ceased all non-essential activities, effective immediately. All campus activities and classes would also be closed through Friday including athletic events and activities. 
Virginia State advised the school’s community to continue checking VSU emails for updates.
Last July, Hampton locked down the school to investigate a bomb threat targeting The William R. Harvey Library and the University Dining Hall, according to WAVY News. Officials determined there was no threat.
Then, a month later in Petersburg, Virginia State locked down its school after four people, none of whom were enrolled students, were shot on Boisseau Street outside Daniel Gymnasium on the university’s campus, 8News reported. The media outlet reported that all four people were then taken to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.
As of 12:30 p.m., no other institute in Virginia has announced any similar closure.

Bob Menendez's wife Nadine was ordered to prison for 54 months for taking nearly $1 million in bribes for his political power.,"Sen. Bob Menendez takes a selfie with his wife, Nadine, and businessman Wael Hana. The three were co-defendants in an 18-count federal corruption indictment. (Courtesy of U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)Nadine Menendez was sentenced to four and a half years behind bars Thursday for her role in a yearslong international bribery scheme that landed her husband, former Sen. Bob Menendez, in a federal prison in June.
She cried as she told U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein during her sentencing hearing at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan federal courthouse in Manhattan that she blames her husband for her criminal troubles.
“I was wrong about my husband,” Menendez said in court, according to the New York Daily News. “I now know, he’s not my savior. He’s not the man I thought he was. I should have asked more questions. I should have known better.”
Prosecutors have portrayed Nadine Menendez, 58, as the greedy go-between in a global scheme in which she accepted bribes of cash, gold bars, a luxury car, and more from three New Jersey businessmen in exchange for her husband’s political influence. The plot began within weeks after the couple met in 2018 and continued until FBI agents raided their Englewood Cliffs home in 2022, prosecutors said.
“They were partners in crime, partners in corruption, and partners in greed,” prosecutor Lara Pomerantz said during the trial’s opening statements in March. “She did the dirty work.”
Stein agreed Nadine Menendez was not “an innocent observer” and sentenced her to 54 months of incarceration, offering some leniency because of the breast cancer that drove him last year to order separate trials for the couple.
She faced decades in prison after a jury convicted her in April of 15 crimes, including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, and conspiracy. Prosecutors wanted her incarcerated for at least seven years, while her defense attorneys sought a sentence of just one year, citing her cancer care and her traumatic childhood as a refugee whose family fled a civil war in Lebanon.
The former senator’s attorneys also played the blame-the-spouse game during his trial, when they portrayed him as an unwitting victim in a scheme orchestrated by his wife. He tried to backtrack that attack in a letter to the judge last month, when he said he “didn’t fully preview” his attorneys’ comments at trial.
“To suggest that Nadine was money hungry or in financial need, and therefore would solicit others for help, is simply wrong,” he wrote.
He implored Stein for leniency for his wife.
“Your Honor, you gave me a tough sentence that surely serves the deterrent value you said was needed,” he wrote. “To imprison Nadine, would not recognize the trauma she has suffered, how it has affected her and her judgment, and I would respectfully say would not have any greater deterrent effect.”
Bob Menendez was chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he was indicted in 2023. He became the first sitting senator ever convicted of acting as a foreign agent after a jury found him guilty in July 2024.
During his nine-week trial, prosecutors presented thousands of pages of documents, text messages, and photographs, and questioned dozens of witnesses to show how he acted to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar and worked to derail several criminal cases against the businessmen, in exchange for the bribes. During both trials, they offered as evidence text messages, voicemails, and other communications between the couple in which they discussed the scheme and riches.
Bob Menendez has appealed his conviction and remains incarcerated at the federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. A Democratic member of Congress for more than 30 years, he has unsuccessfully sought a pardon from President Donald Trump. He was sentenced to 11 years behind bars.
Two of the businessmen involved in the bribery scheme, halal meat exporter Wael Hana and real estate developer Fred Daibes, were also convicted and sent to prison for just over eight years and seven years, respectively.
Sentencing for the third businessman, Jose Uribe, is set for Oct. 9. He testified against his co-defendants in a cooperation deal with prosecutors.

For Ponka-we Cozad, the National Day of Remembrance for Indian boarding school survivors is personal.
Members of her family attended boarding schools and shared hurtful stories about their days in the schools.
“In some way, shape or form, as Native peoples, we all have a story to share about the Indian boarding school era,” said Cozad, director of policy and advocacy at the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition. Cozad is Tohono O’odham Nation of Arizona and the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.
“This is why I’m doing this work; when we talk about something always being in our hearts, it’s personal,” she told ICT.
The annual National Day of Remembrance for U.S. Indian boarding school survivors on Sept. 16 in Washington, D.C., with a special event sponsored by the coalition, known as NABS, from 5-7 p.m. EST at the Indian Gaming Association building.
The theme of this year’s event is “Always in our hearts.”
A number of other gatherings are scheduled across Indian Country to commemorate the Day of Remembrance with vigils, prayers, and other events in museums, churches and local communities.
September is an important month on both sides of the U.S. border. September 30 is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation in Canada, known as Orange Shirt Day, in memory of the residential school students and the harsh conditions they endured. It became a national holiday after more than 1,000 unmarked graves were found at residential schools, including at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.
In the U.S., where thousands of Native children died in boarding schools, the National Day of Remembrance provides an opportunity for tribal leaders, survivors, descendants of survivors as well as congressional members and the public to come together to honor and recognize children who never returned home from the schools.
This year, the event coincides with the National Congress of American Indians Tribal Unity Impact Days, Sept. 16-18, also in Washington, D.C.
During the Impact Days,  NCAI organizes sessions in which tribal leaders can meet with members of Congress and federal agency officials in order to advocate for priorities such as fiscal year 2026 appropriations, public safety, economic development, housing, self-determination and other issues.
The Day of Remembrance also coincides with the fall session of the U.S. Congress, which convened on Sept. 2, giving lawmakers another opportunity to consider passing the Truth and Healing Commission on the Indian Boarding School Policies  Act (S.761). The act would establish a commission to investigate, document and report on the histories of Indian boarding schools, develop recommendations for federal efforts based on those findings and promote healing for survivors and descendants.
Although the bill passed  the Senate with a unanimous vote in December 2024, the House of Representatives did not bring the bill up for a vote before the legislative session ended.
In March, 2025, U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, and Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, reintroduced the bill. It is now awaiting further consideration and a full vote in the Senate.
At the event in Washington, a light reception and candlelight vigil will be held, and will include remarks from Deb Parker, the chief executive officer of NABS and a citizen of the Tulalip Tribe and descendant of the Yaqui and Apache tribes.

(File photo Maryland Matters)State Highway Administration officials “knowingly charged” nearly $360 million in unauthorized expenses to federal fund projects in an attempt to hide a deficit in the state’s Transportation Trust Fund, according to a new state audit.
The expenditures for more than 500 projects with $50,000 or more in expenses may not be recoverable. To cover the gap, the state may have to tap a $400 million Transportation Trust Fund balance or state general funds, according to the audit from the Office of Legislative Audits that was released to the public Thursday.
“More concerning is that the amount of unauthorized spending increased by 3,523 percent, including an additional $163.5 million between June 2024 and August 2025,” Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen wrote in his report.
Auditors reported a sharp increase of expenses carried as billable to the federal government, even though they had not yet been authorized.
“SHA also was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $449 million (which would include the aforementioned unauthorized expenses) or the subsequent recovery of the funds,” Tanen wrote. “To the extent that the federal funds are not available, Transportation Trust funds or State general funds, may be needed to cover any related deficits.”
Key Bridge deconstruction continues as officials eye initial effort for a new span

The audit looked at a four-year period between Nov. 1, 2020, and Oct. 31, 2024. Auditors said they looked at the period based on a complaint to the office’s fraud, waste and abuse hotline reporting a recent “rapid increase in the federal funds receivable balance.”
The findings supported the allegation in the complaint but “did not identify any matters that warranted” referral to the Office of the Attorney General for a criminal investigation.
Auditors reported a sharp increase of expenses carried as billable to the federal government even though they had not yet been authorized.
Between 2017 and 2020, the amount of unauthorized expenses  ranged between $7.7 million and about $10 million. But by June 2024, the amount had grown to more than $195 million. And in August 2025, the amount approached $360 million.
In one example, auditors found that the highway administration had fully spent $2.7 million in federal funds on an approved, unnamed project by September 2023. Even so, the agency charged an additional $3.1 million to the same project through August 2025.
Auditors noted that while the projects were authorized by the federal government, the amounts charged to them by SHA exceeded authorized federal aid.
Those additional charges, the auditors noted, “may not be recoverable.”
“According to agency management, SHA knowingly charged these costs as federal funds on the State’s accounting records to minimize the Transportation Trust Fund deficit,” auditors wrote. “Specifically, SHA management advised that they have sought additional federal funding when expenditures exceeded the federal grant and have attempted to find federal funds to cover more projects (including smaller projects that were traditionally funded through the Transportation Trust Fund).
“However … the federal granting agency has not authorized additional funding for these projects which will need to be funded with Transportation Trust Funds … or state funds,” the audit said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In their response, state transportation officials said it was “not factually accurate to say that projects were not authorized, but it is accurate that in some cases, expenses charged exceeded the initial authorized amounts.”
The agency said it works to determine if additional costs warrant modifications to its request for federal reimbursement.
“If the expenditure is deemed federally ineligible for reimbursement, it would be expensed to state funds,” the agency wrote in its response.
Auditors said they also found that in some cases, the highways administration “purposefully recorded” some “unbillable expenditures” as a federal receivable “without disclosing the unbillable nature of these funds.”
Transportation officials agreed with the findings and said it was working to “quantify any unrecoverable amounts and adjust account balances.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/highway-work-newsletter-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-11 12:57:56.888024

To accept what happened to Charlie Kirk as par for the course is to say that, in America, bullets are more important than ideas. Don’t take the bait, Rod Miller and Clair McFarland write.
The post Dying for speech can’t be the new normal appeared first on WyoFile .","Charlie Kirk was assassinated Wednesday while speaking at a college in Utah. There will be many details forthcoming, as the investigation into Kirk’s murder progresses. But make no mistake, Charlie Kirk was killed for speaking his mind.

Opinion

The footage circulating online shows Kirk uttering the words “gang violence” and then suffering what looks like a gunshot to the neck. 
Kirk’s style of engaging with young people is widely known and recognizable. Not quite a trademark, but he did it more actively than anyone else: the back-and-forth, the conversation, the debate. 
Sometimes that devolved into “the own.”
In America, we risk getting “owned” by a conservative (or liberal) influencer once in a while, when we teeter onto the beam of free speech. 
A little blushing, a little back-pedaling, and we’re on our way: embarrassed, but free to be embarrassed in the crossfire of ideas. 
It is this free exchange of ideas that flows from the First Amendment to our Constitution. Our national discourse has room for all points of view, even if those ideas are odious to some. Our guarantee to say what is on our mind makes each of us uniquely American, and to thwart that freedom with violence in the marketplace of ideas diminishes us all.
To accept what happened to Charlie Kirk as somehow par for the course is to say that, in America, violence is more powerful than words, that bullets are more important than ideas.
To say Kirk deserved to be shot for his point of view is reprehensible. 
But even as we recognize how reprehensible that notion is and feel it pucker places the Constitution doesn’t address, we can’t take the bait.
We can’t meet violence with violence. 
Let words be your sword. Let ideas be your honing stone. 
And if you can’t enter the debate because your ideas suck and you stumble over your words, just listen for a while. 
Consider the painstaking thought that formed our Constitution and its declarations of rights. Consider the forge that produced them. 
A convention. A meeting. 
A bunch of young bucks and their token old guy — Benjamin Franklin, the titan of outspokenness and the press’s true patron saint — swapping ideas. Not crossing swords. 
They made an America where words are mighty. 
We are both journalists. That means we belong to the only occupation whose freedom to operate is enshrined in the same First Amendment that guaranteed Charlie Kirk’s freedom of speech. The national cacophony of rhetoric erupting in reaction to Kirk’s murder is also protected by the First Amendment, even if some of it might make your skin crawl. 
But as journalists, our loyalties must lie with the Constitution and the freedoms that it guarantees, not with one side or another in this acrimonious debate. 
We fumble as a nation for something to help us rise above the murky political resentment and tribalism that grip our country and poison our thinking. 
For us, that something is our liberty as citizens of the United States to express ourselves freely. When anyone, for any reason, tries to negate that freedom through violence, we must speak up. 
And we must bridge our lesser differences to do so.
